## Projects
### NLP on Earnings Release (10K, 8K)
#### Pata Processing (Week 0-2)
1. Download Notre Dame parsed 10K data--Week 1
2. Replicate JW paper (bags of words methond on 10K)--Week 1
3. Download and Parse SEC 8K data--Week 1-2
4. Stock Price database? 
#### Algorithm Design (Week 3-8)
5. Potential directions  
5.1. Examine the impact on stock returns (i.e., market response) right after release  
5.2. Examine the potential usage on fraud dectection (see, PS paper)  
5.3. Examine the insider trading during 8-K trading gap

5.4 For all the above direction: test advanced methods (e.g., Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, RNN, etc)  

### NLP on Twitter 
Some background

#### Data Processing (Week 0-2) --Ty
1. Download twitter news of companies -- Week 1-2 
#### Algorithm Design (Week 3-8)
2. Potential directions  
2.1. Examine the impact on stock returns (i.e., market response)  
2.2. Examine the potential usage on fraud dectection (applying the fog index, PS paper)  
2.3 For all the above direction: test advanced methods (e.g., Word2Vec, Paragraph2Vec, RNN, etc)  


## Plan
### Week 0 (June 30): 
1. Working on the code to replicate JW paper. --Mandy
2. Download 8K --David/Ty/Jake
3. Download twitter data --Ty
### Week 1 (July 7): 
1. Finished downloading the university of notre dame data. --Ty or David or Jake  
2. Finished Replication of JW paper (as their dataset is different from notre dame data, data processing is still expected) --Mandy
3. Continue downloading 8K data. -- David or Ty or Jake?
4. Continue downloading twitter data. --Ty
4. Stock price database? 
July 7: Meet with Laura Li to discuss the direction.
### Week 2 (July 14): 

### Week 3 (July 21):

### Week 4 (July 28):

### Week 5 (Aug 4):

### Week 6 (Aug 11):
