NEWS RELEASE

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
SEPTEMBER 22, 2004

THE DRESS BARN, INC. REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-END FINANCIAL RESULTS

SUFFERN,  NY - SEPTEMBER 22, 2004 - The Dress Barn, Inc. (NASDAQ - DBRN), one of
the nation's  leading women's  specialty  retailers  offering quality career and
casual fashion  apparel at value prices,  today reported  earnings and sales for
its fiscal fourth quarter and year ended July 31, 2004.

Net  earnings  for the fiscal  fourth  quarter  ended  July 31,  2004 were $13.5
million or $0.44 per share. This compares to a net loss of $8.0 million or $0.27
loss per share last year.  Last  year's  fourth  quarter  loss  resulted  from a
pre-tax litigation charge of $32 million that impacted earnings.  Fourth quarter
earnings,  excluding the effect of this charge, would have been $12.5 million or
$0.42 per share.  The Company  continues  to strongly  believe  that there is no
merit  for the jury  award and has  appealed  it.  This  year's  fourth  quarter
earnings were favorably  impacted by the extra reporting week as a result of the
Company's fiscal year ended July 31, 2004, which included a fifty-third week.

As  previously  reported,  net sales for the thirteen week period ended July 24,
2004  increased  4% to $196.3  million  compared to $188.1  million for the same
comparable period last year.  Same-store sales increased 1%. Total sales for the
fourteen week period ended July 31, 2004 were $208.0 million.

Net earnings for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004 were $30.1 million or $1.00
per share. This compares to $8.0 million or $0.25 per share last year, which was
impacted by the litigation charge. Excluding the effect of this charge, earnings
would have been $28.5 million or $0.89 per share.

Net sales for the  fifty-two  week period  ended July 24, 2004  increased  5% to
$743.2 million  compared to $707.1 million for the same  comparable  period last
year.  Same-store  sales  increased  2% for this  period.  Total  sales  for the
fifty-three week period ended July 31, 2004 were $754.9 million.

Elliot S. Jaffe, Chairman of the Board, commented: "Our fourth quarter reflected
mixed sales  results.  Like much of the  industry,  we  experienced  weak demand
towards the back half of the quarter.  We believe this  slowdown was caused by a
number of external  factors  including high energy  prices,  weather and ongoing
geopolitical uncertainties. These factors could further impact consumer spending
going  forward.  Nevertheless,  we were  generally  pleased  with  the  level of
earnings achieved, which was primarily driven by improved gross profit."

"We  continue to operate our  business  cautiously,  maintaining  our  inventory
discipline,  while keeping our assortments fresh. Overall,  inventory levels are
current and in good shape heading into the new fall season."

<PAGE>

As of July 31, 2004,  the Company  operated 776 stores (178 Dress Barn, 53 Dress
