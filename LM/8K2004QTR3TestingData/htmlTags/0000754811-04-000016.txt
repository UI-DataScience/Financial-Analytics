      U.S. Global Investors Announces Positive End-of-Year Results Company
                strengthens financial position through increased
                 managed assets and repayment of all bank debt.

 ***************************************************************************

SAN ANTONIO - September 27, 2004 - U.S. Global Investors,  Inc.  (NASDAQ:  GROW)
(the Company),  a boutique registered  investment advisory firm, today announced
the results of operations  for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2004. The Company
posted net income of $2,166,642, or $0.29 per share, compared to a net income of
$42,612,  or $0.01 per share, for the 2003 fiscal year.  Revenues for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 2004, were  approximately  $12.98 million,  or 73.6 percent
higher than the fiscal year 2003.

"The  biggest  driver  behind  this  significant  increase  in net income is the
substantial  asset growth in the Company's gold,  natural  resources and foreign
equity  funds,"  says Frank  Holmes,  Chief  Executive  Officer  of U.S.  Global
Investors. "During this secular bull market in commodities,  investors have been
attracted to our specialty funds due to their superior relative performance when
compared to their  peers.  We believe  Asia is the key driver  behind  commodity
demand and that global environmental  regulations are slowing the supply to meet
this demand.  This has been reflected in the price of its stock,  `GROW',  which
has  outperformed  the S&P 500 for the past 1-, 3- and 5-year periods as of June
30, 2004."

According to Lipper,  as of June 30, 2004 the U.S. Global  Investors fund family
had several funds  leading  their peer group,  as well as the fund universe as a
whole.  In fact,  three U.S.  Global  funds--the  World  Precious  Minerals Fund
(UNWPX),  the Global  Resources  Fund  (PSPFX),  and the Eastern  European  Fund
(EUROX)--ranked  #1 in their  peer  groups  for both the 1- and  3-year  periods
ending June 30, 2004, based on total return.  (The World Precious  Minerals Fund
ranked 1 out of 48, 1 out of 39,  15 out of 30,  and 12 out of 18 gold  oriented
funds for the 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. The Global Resources Fund ranked 1
out of 76, 1 out of 70, 11 out of 55, and 17 out of 20 natural  resources  funds
for the 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year  periods.  The Eastern European Fund ranked 1 out
of 181, 1 out of 150, and 3 out of 118 emerging markets funds for the 1-, 3- and
5-year periods.) As a result of such strong asset growth,  U.S. Global Investors
paid off the remainder of its mortgage bank debt.  Through its early  repayment,
U.S. Global expects to free up future cash flows.

Although there was a slight market correction over the past quarter, U.S. Global
Investors has also seen positive growth in its own investment  portfolio for the
year.

Expenses  for the fiscal year ending  June 30,  2004 were  approximately  $10.14
million,  or 29.7  percent  higher than the 2003 fiscal  year.  Consistent  with
increased fund assets,  certain sub-advisory fees,  distribution  platform costs
(e.g. Schwab) and  performance-driven  salary costs contributed to the increases
in expenses. Regulatory costs have also added to the Company's expenses, but are
necessary to comply with  regulations  addressing  recent  scandals in corporate
America.

Book value per share increased from $0.76 at June 30, 2003 to $1.14 at June 30,
2004.
