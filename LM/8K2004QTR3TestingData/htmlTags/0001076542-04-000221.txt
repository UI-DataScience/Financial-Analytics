                   BOWLIN TRAVEL CENTERS REPORT SECOND QUARTER

                      AND SIX MONTH RESULTS FOR FISCAL 2005


ALBUQUERQUE,  NEW MEXICO,  SEPTEMBER  10, 2004 -- BOWLIN  TRAVEL  CENTERS,  INC.
(OTCBB:  BWTL) today reported net sales of $7.021 million for the second quarter
ended July 31, 2004, an increase of 12.6% compared to the prior year period when
net sales were $6.234 million.  Net income for the second  quarter,  three-month
period  increased 3% to $348,000  compared to $338,000 for the prior year period
ended July 31, 2003.  Earnings per share for the  three-month  period ended July
31,  2004 was  $0.08  per basic and  diluted  share  versus  $0.07 per basic and
diluted share in the same period of the prior year.

Net sales for the  six-month  period were $12.470  million,  an increase of 9.6%
compared to the prior year six-month period when net sales were $11.379 million.
Net income of  $362,000  for the  current  year,  six-month  period was off 6.7%
compared to net income of $388,000 in the prior year six-month period ended July
31, 2003. Earnings per basic and diluted share for the first half of fiscal year
2005 was  $0.08  versus  $0.09 per basic  and  diluted  share in the prior  year
period.

Michael L. Bowlin,  chairman and chief executive  officer said, "The increase in
our net  sales is  directly  attributable  to our  strong,  continuing  focus on
operations at our travel  centers.  Our sales  incentive  program and management
support at each location are producing  positive  results.  In addition,  volume
purchasing helped to increase gross profits.

"Net  income for the second  quarter and the first half of fiscal year 2005 were
primarily  affected  by the decline in other  non-operating  income of 43.9% and
43.8%, respectively."
