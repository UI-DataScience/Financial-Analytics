                    Air Methods Updates Third Quarter Outlook
  FIRST TWO MONTHS IMPACTED BY HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED MAINTENANCE EXPENSES, BAD
         DEBT RESERVE INCREASES AND LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED FLIGHT VOLUME

DENVER,  CO,  September  23, 2004 -- Air Methods Corporation (NASDAQ: AIRM), the
world's  largest  air  medical transportation company, provided an update of the
financial results for its third quarter ending September 30, 2004.

The  Company  announced  that  its  third  quarter  results  through August were
impacted  by  a  $1.3 million increase in bad debt reserves primarily associated
with  changes  in its historical collection rates and payer mix estimates.  On a
positive  note, days' sales outstanding have decreased from 133 days as of March
31,  2004  to 110 days as of August 31, 2004.  Bad debt reserve rates applied to
current  period transports have increased only slightly as compared to June 2004
transports.

The  quarter-to-date  period  also  reflects  a  17.9%  increase  in maintenance
expenses  as  compared with the prior year two-month period, despite only a 3.1%
increase  in  flight  volume.  The  percentage increase not attributed to flight
volume  reflects  an  increase  of  approximately $1,100,000 over the prior-year
period.  The  increase in expense was primarily attributed to significant engine
and  transmission  overhaul  activity  during  the  period, combined with annual
inflationary  adjustments  in  parts  and  overhaul  costs.

Additionally,  community-based  transports  during  the month of August were 229
below  budget  expectations.  For  community bases in operation greater than one
year,  360  fewer  requests  for  service  were  received  as  compared with the
prior-year  month,  partially  attributed to unfavorable weather patterns in the
Eastern States. Community-based operating bases in service greater than one year
in  the  Northeast  and  Southeast regions averaged almost 10 fewer requests for
service  per  base  during  August  than in the prior-year period. The aggregate
unfavorable  budget  variance  attributed  to  the  lower  flight  volume  was
approximately $1,000,000 based on average net revenue after bad debt expense per
transport  recorded  during  the  period.

Although  the Company has remained profitable during July and August, management
anticipates  the  financial  results  for  the quarter to be significantly below
budgeted expectations.  In light of these developments, management believes that
it  is  highly  improbable  that  the  Company  will achieve growth in its basic
earnings  per  share  for  2004.

Aaron  Todd,  CEO  of  Air  Methods, stated, "We are certainly disappointed with
these recent developments.  While fluctuations in maintenance expenses, bad debt
expense,  and  flight  volume are inherent within our business, it is unusual to
have all three variables impact us negatively at the same time."

"With  the  significant  reduction  in  days'  sales  outstanding and relatively
unchanged  collection  rates  subsequent  to  June 30, 2004, we are hopeful that
future  adjustments  will  be  less  significant.  We  are  also encouraged that
community-based  flight volumes for the first half of September have returned to

budgeted  expectations.  Effective  September  1,  2004,  the  Company  has also
adjusted  its  pricing  structure  to  facilitate  stronger  reimbursement  per
transport.  While  these  changes  will  not  fully offset the factors discussed
above, they should position the Company for better results moving forward," said
Todd.

Air  Methods  Corporation  (www.airmethods.com)  is  a  leader  in  emergency
