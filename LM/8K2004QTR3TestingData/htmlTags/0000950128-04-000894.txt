                         LAUREL CAPITAL GROUP ANNOUNCES
             EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR AND FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004

ALLISON PARK, PA - August 31, 2004 - Laurel Capital Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: LARL)
today reported net income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 of $1.7
million or $.85 per diluted share compared to net income of $2.5 million or
$1.28 per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2003. The $847,000 or 33.4%
decrease in net income for the year reflects the effect of a decrease in net
interest income combined with higher operating expenses, partially offset by an
increase in other operating income and a decrease in income tax expense. The
increase in other operating income consisted primarily of income from the Bank's
investment in Bank Owned Life Insurance and an increase in service fees
collected. The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributed to
expenses incurred from the operation of two additional branch offices and the
amortization of the core deposit intangible, which were both obtained as part of
the acquisition of SFSB Holding Company on March 28, 2003, increasing the number
of full-service offices to eight.

For fiscal 2004, the Company's return on average assets (ROA) was .55% and
return on average stockholders' equity was 6.19% compared to .89% and 9.32%,
respectively, for fiscal 2003.

Laurel Capital Group, Inc. also reported net income for the quarter ended June
30, 2004 of $431,000 or $.22 per diluted share compared to $556,000 or $.28 per
diluted share for the quarter ended June 30, 2003. The 22.5% decrease in net
income was primarily attributable to a decrease in net interest income, which
was partially offset by an increase in other income and a decrease in other
operating and income tax expenses.

Non-performing assets, which consist of loans delinquent 90 days and over,
increased $1.2 million to $2.2 million or .72% of total assets at June 30, 2004
compared to $956,000 or .30% of total assets at June 30, 2003. The increase in
non-performing loans was primarily due to three commercial loans having an
average balance of $239,000 and two single-family loans having an average
balance of $227,000 becoming non-performing. Management does not believe that
the current level of non-performing loans pose a material risk to the Company.

In commenting on the Company's performance, Edwin R. Maus, President and Chief
Executive Officer, stated that "The challenging interest rate and economic
environment continues to inhibit the Company's operations and ability to
generate earnings growth in a conservative manner. Notwithstanding these
challenges, we believe we are positioned to take advantage of changes in these
environments as they occur."

At June 30, 2004, Laurel Capital Group, Inc. had total assets of $299.4 million,
loans receivable, net of $173.3 million and total deposits of $246.2 million.
Additionally, stockholders' equity amounted to $27.1 million or $14.06 per share
compared to $27.7 million or $14.71 per share at June 30, 2003.

Laurel Capital Group, Inc., headquartered in Allison Park, PA, is the holding
company for Laurel Savings Bank. Laurel Savings Bank is a 117-year-old,
Pennsylvania-chartered, FDIC-insured

(1) Total operating expenses (excluding net income or (loss) on other real
estate owned) divided by total operating income (excluding gains on sale of
assets available for sale). Gains and losses on the sales of assets available
for sale are excluded since they are generally considered by the Company's
management to be non-recurring in nature. Similarly, net income or loss on other
real estate owned is excluded since it is generally considered by the Company's
management to be non-recuring in nature. The efficiency ratio is not a financial
measurement required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United
States of America. However, the Company believes such information is useful to
investors in evaluating the Company's operation.

As a result of rounding, the sum of quarterly amounts may not equal the
year-to-date amounts.
