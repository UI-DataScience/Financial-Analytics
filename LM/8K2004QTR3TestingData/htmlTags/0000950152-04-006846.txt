PDG ENVIRONMENTAL, INC. POSTS RESULTS FOR SECOND QUARTER & SIX MONTHS ENDED 2004
Monday, September 13, 8:31 am ET

REVENUE & INCOME CLIMB SHARPLY

PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--September 13, 2004--PDG Environmental, Inc. (OTC
BB: PDGE - News), an environmental and specialty contractor, today reported
financial results for the second quarter and six-months ended July 31, 2004.

Revenues for the second quarter were $15.2 million, a 61% increase over the $9.5
million in the same prior-year period. Net income for the quarter doubled to
$295,000, or $0.02 per fully diluted share as compared to the previous year's
second quarter net income of $146,000, or $0.02 per fully diluted share.

Revenues for the six months ended July 31, 2004 were $26.1 million, a 46%
increase over the $17.8 million in the same prior-year period. Net income for
the six months was up 30% to $484,000, or $0.04 per fully diluted share as
compared to the previous year's first half net income of $373,000, or $0.04 per
fully diluted share. Despite the increase in profit for the quarter and six
months, diluted earnings per share remained the same due to the investment made
by Barron Partners in February 2004.

John Regan, Chairman and CEO, commented, "The ramp up in project workload that
began late in the first quarter continued strongly in the second quarter to
near-record levels. We did experience some labor shortages and productivity
issues related to this rapid expansion, which now appear to be corrected."

He added, "Going into the second half of the year, our normal contracted backlog
remains strong at $35.8 million. In addition, we are experiencing a tremendous
demand for PDGE's various services as a result of the unfortunate devastation in
Florida from Hurricanes Charley and Frances. In addition to the immediate
disaster response, which is being handled by our Tampa and Ft. Lauderdale
locations, the extensive flooding and water damage is expected to create
increased demand for our mold remediation services in the months to come. This
will likely translate into continued significant growth in the second half."
