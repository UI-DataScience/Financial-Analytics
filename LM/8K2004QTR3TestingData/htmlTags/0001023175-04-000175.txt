        iMedia International, Inc. Reports Record Revenues
                        for Second Quarter

SANTA MONICA, Calif., -- iMedia International. Inc. (Other OTC: IMNL.PK) is
pleased to report record revenues of $899,675 in the second quarter ended June
30, 2004 compared to $102,120 during the second quarter of 2003, an increase
of over 750%.  The increase in sales is indicative of the Company's increased
ability to procure new business and the shift in its sales emphasis towards
special edition and custom disc production.  "We have focused much of our
sales and marketing activities towards forming strategic partnerships with
publishers of newspapers, magazines and various new corporate clients, the
results of which we feel will be realized within the next six months," states
David MacEachern, Chairman and CEO of iMedia International, Inc.    He added,
"in addition, we are increasing emphasis on marketing to the direct response
industry for new business."

In recent developments, iMedia:

- -     Announced that its subsidiary, Hollywood Previews, released the 2004
      Tribeca Film Festival Special issue of Hollywood Previews(TM)Magazine.

- -     Was featured in the April 19th issue of Advertising Age Magazine, which
      described iMedia's unique interactive disc media as "The cutting edge in
      FSI (free standing inserts)."

- -     Announced the successful distribution by Univision (NYSE:UVN - News) of
      the iMedia produced CD-ROM "Hispanic Vote Tool Kit."

- -     Signed an agreement with International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local
      Union 495 to create a new messaging program aimed at improving
      communications with Local members and attracting new members.

- -     Announced an agreement with the Los Angeles Times to jointly market a
      digitally enhanced supplement to Las Vegas hotels, casinos and other
      prospective sponsors.

- -     Announced an agreement to begin developing unique and innovative DVD and
      CD-ROM based promotional discs for selected PRIMEDIA (NYSE:PRM - News)
      publications and advertisers.

- -     Announced the completion of the production and distribution of an
      interactive promotional disc on behalf of FX Networks, LLC (a division
      of FOX TV), for the hit series Nip/Tuck.

- -     Announced an agreement to produce an interactive product iCatalog(TM)
      for TELEBrands Corporation, one of the world's largest direct response
      television advertising companies.

- -     Announced the completion and distribution of its third interactive
      promotional disc for FX Networks, LLC, to promote the new television
      show "Rescue Me".

Cost of sales increased to $766,409 from $204,486 for the three months ended
June 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Gross profit contribution was $133,266
(or 15%) and $5,089 (or 14%) for the three months ended June 30, 2004 and
2003, respectively, an increase of 25 times.  [Cost of sales] for the
quarterly period ending June 30, 2004 originated primarily from the design,
production and distribution of custom discs and royalties.  Cost of sales from
the comparative prior year period included a combination of design and
manufacturing costs, thus there is little parity in comparisons between the
two periods.


<PAGE>

Operating expenses increased to $1,158,317 for the three months ended June 30,
2004, from $641,234 for the same period in the prior year, an increase of
113%.  The increase in expenses is due to continued development of products,
growth initiatives, expenses associated with expanded sales efforts, as well
as substantial legal and accounting costs associated with the maintenance of
iMedia's fully-reporting status.  Interest expense, relating to convertible
debt interest, increased to $95,044 for the three months ended June 30, 2004.
Bank interest of $511 was incurred for the same period in the prior year.

Net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2004 increased to ($1,241,595)
compared to ($802,525) for the prior year's comparable period, an increase in
net loss of ($439,070) or (54%).    The increase in net loss is primarily
attributable to the expanded operations, the substantial legal and accounting
costs related to our fully-reporting status, and our increased sales and
marketing efforts.

"I am very excited about the continuing growth of our business and revenues.
We have seen a huge increase in business since we began focusing on the
production of custom discs.  Revenue projections for Q3 and Q4 look very
strong, and our sales cycles continue to shorten" concluded David MacEachern.
