BRADY CORPORATION REPORTS RECORD SALES AND EARNINGS FOR FISCAL 2004 FOURTH
QUARTER AND YEAR END.

MILWAUKEE (September 15, 2004)----Brady Corporation (NYSE: BRC) today reported
record results for its fiscal 2004 fourth quarter and fiscal year ended July 31,
2004.

         Sales in the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter rose 28 percent to $185.5
million, compared to sales of $144.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2003. Base business grew 12 percent compared to the prior year's quarter, with
acquisitions adding 13 percent. Foreign currency translation added 3 percent to
sales. Sales increased in all geographic regions, with growth being particularly
strong in Asia-Pacific.

         Net income for the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter was $16.1 million, or
$0.66 per diluted Class A Common Share, up from $1.8 million, or $0.08 per
share, in the fiscal 2003 fourth quarter. Net income in the fiscal 2004 fourth
quarter included a $3 million tax benefit from resolution of a tax audit.
Results last year included a restructuring charge of $6.3 million after tax.
Expenses of $0.6 million after tax related to this same restructuring were
charged in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.

         Brady's fiscal 2004 net sales rose 21 percent to $671.2 million
compared to fiscal 2003 sales of $554.9 million. Base sales grew 5 percent.
Acquisitions added 10 percent and foreign currency added 6 percent to total
sales results.

         Net income for fiscal 2004 rose 137 percent to $50.9 million or $2.13
per diluted Class A Common Share, compared to $21.4 million or $0.91 per diluted
share in fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2004 net income included the previously mentioned
$3 million tax benefit, and charges of $2.2 million after tax related to last
year's restructuring.

         Fiscal 2004 cash flow from operations was a record $84.8 million, up 53
percent from the prior year.

         "Fiscal 2004 was a great year for Brady Corporation," Brady President
and Chief Executive Officer Frank M. Jaehnert said. "A return to growth in our
core markets has accelerated our sales growth throughout the year. We launched a
number of successful proprietary products and acquired four companies, including
Emed Co., the largest acquisition in Brady's history. And the broad success of
our initiatives and cost control efforts have resulted in exceptional growth in
our bottom line."

         "We are increasing our guidance for fiscal 2005 to reflect a continued
positive trend in growth in our base business, along with the recent acquisition
of ID Technologies," said Brady Vice President and Chief Financial Officer David
Mathieson. "We now expect fiscal 2005 sales to be in the range of $770 to $790
million and net income of $59 to $62 million with earnings per diluted share of
$2.41 to $2.53."

         A Webcast regarding fiscal 2004 results will be available at
www.investor.bradycorp.com beginning at 9:30 a.m. Central Daylight Time today.
