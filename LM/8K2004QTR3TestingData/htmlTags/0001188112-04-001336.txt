[LOGO] ACETO

                              FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
         ACETO CORPORATION REPORTS RECORD FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL 2004
                     SALES, GROSS PROFIT, NET INCOME AND EPS

             FOURTH QUARTER NET INCOME UP 36% ON 12% SALES INCREASE

LAKE SUCCESS, NY - September 10, 2004 - Aceto Corporation (Nasdaq:ACET), a
global distributor of chemically-derived pharmaceuticals, biopharmaceuticals,
specialty chemicals and agrochemicals, today announced record results of
operations for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.

FOURTH QUARTER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS - versus fiscal 2003 fourth quarter
     o    Net sales grew 12% to $76.5 million.
     o    Gross profit margin increased to 17.1% from 16.2%.
     o    Operating income rose 28% to $3.3 million.
     o    Net income was up 36% to $3.3 million, or $0.20 per diluted share,
          from $2.4 million or $0.15 per diluted share.

FISCAL YEAR FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS - versus fiscal 2003
     o    Net sales rose 10% to $297.7 million.
     o    Gross profit margin increased to 17.8% from 16.4%.
     o    Operating income was up 24% to $16.0 million.
     o    Income, before the cumulative effect of a non-cash accounting change
          of $1.9 million last year, grew 38% to $13.1 million or $0.81 per
          diluted share, from $9.5 million or $0.62 per diluted share.

Leonard S. Schwartz, Chairman, CEO and President of Aceto, stated, "2004 was
Aceto's best year in the Company's history, with sales, gross profit, net income
and EPS all reaching record levels. Our three main business segments - Health
Sciences, Chemicals & Colorants, and Agrochemicals - all performed well, posting
growth in sales and gross profit margins over fiscal 2003 levels. Additionally,
fiscal 2004 represented a period of significant corporate developments,
including a strategic acquisition that enhanced our earnings, a joint venture,
and expansion into new segments and geographic markets, as highlighted below:

     o    We acquired Pharma Waldhof, a distributor of biopharmaceuticals, from
          Roche. The acquisition, which was immediately accretive to Aceto's
          earnings, enabled us to enter the biopharmaceuticals market. Our
          biopharmaceutical business is included within our Health Sciences
          segment. Additionally, we are engaged in development activities to
          enter the emerging generic biopharmaceuticals segment.

     o    In line with our plan to expand our Agrochemicals segment, we formed a
          joint venture with Nufarm Limited to capitalize on the imminent shift

<PAGE>

          in the agrochemical supply channels. The joint venture acquired the
          EPA labels for the herbicide Butoxone(R) and began marketing the
          product, which has contributed to the strong performance of our
          Agrochemicals segment.

     o    We opened an office in Poland through which we are working with
          pharmaceutical manufacturers in the ten countries that recently joined
          the EU, supplying them with EU-approved active pharmaceutical
          ingredients (APIs). We have begun to generate sales through this
          initiative.

Douglas Roth, CFO of Aceto added, "Also during fiscal 2004, we further
strengthened our financial position, which continues to provide a solid
foundation for Aceto's growth. At year-end, the Company had cash of $32.3
million and zero debt, as we paid off our remaining outstanding short-term debt
of $1.3 million during the fourth quarter. Our working capital increased to
$84.1 million, and our shareholders' equity increased to $100.3 million, a
milestone for Aceto."

Mr. Roth further stated, "Our results were positively impacted by a reduced
effective tax rate of 24.4% for fiscal 2004, down from last year's rate of
29.2%. This reduction was driven by strong earnings contribution from our
subsidiaries located in low tax jurisdictions. We expect this trend to
continue."

Mr. Schwartz continued, "For fiscal 2005, we are focused on organic growth in
each of our main business segments, namely, launching new APIs and nutritionals
in our Health Sciences segment, expanding worldwide sales in our Chemicals &
Colorants group, and further developing our Agrochemicals segment by acquiring
additional new products for distribution and intellectual property. In addition,
we are continuing to strengthen our sourcing operations in China and India,
which is the backbone of our business.

"We are also pursuing the following new endeavors:

     o    We are moving forward with the market development of products for the
          emerging generic biopharmaceutical industry. In this regard, we expect
          to generate initial commercial sales in the next 18 months based on
          certain regulatory pathways already in place.

     o    Another area of potential growth for Aceto is organic color pigments,
          one of the fastest growing segments of the chemical industry due to
          the increasing use of color in newspapers and magazines. We have been
          conducting market development in this area for over a year, and have
          begun to record commercial sales.

     o    Additionally, the Company has developed a patent-pending product that
          abates odors emitted from landfills, which is an important
          environmental, health and safety issue. Initial feedback from the
          market has been very positive, and one major landfill operator plans
          to commence a full-scale test shortly."

Mr. Schwartz concluded, "These endeavors I highlighted are made possible by our
extremely talented global management team of 26 who average 18 years with Aceto,
as well as our highly skilled staff. We remain enthusiastic about the Company's
prospects based on the growth initiatives we have in place, and our

<PAGE>

success in executing on our plans to date. In terms of financial guidance, we
expect to earn $0.21 - 0.24 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal
2005. We look forward to updating you with our continued progress."
