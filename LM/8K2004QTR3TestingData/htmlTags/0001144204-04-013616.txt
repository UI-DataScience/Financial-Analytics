                              FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
                              ---------------------

     FUELCELL ENERGY REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2004 RESULTS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS

       Started Operating First One Megawatt DFC Power Plant on Natural Gas
          45 Million Kilowatt Hours Generated To Date at Customer Sites

DANBURY, CONN., AUGUST 30, 2004 -- FUELCELL ENERGY, INC. (NASDAQNM:FCEL) (THE
COMPANY), a leading manufacturer of stationary fuel cell power plants for
distributed generation, today reported results and accomplishments for the
quarter and nine months ended July 31, 2004.

FINANCIAL RESULTS

FuelCell Energy reported a net loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 of
$18.9 million or $0.39 per basic and diluted share, compared to $15.0 million or
$0.38 per basic and diluted share in the same period of the previous year.
Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 were $8.1 million compared to $7.3
million in the same period a year ago.

Cash, cash equivalents and investments (U.S. Treasuries) on hand as of July 31,
2004 totaled $169.4 million. Net cash used during the quarter was $1.9 million.
The Company received proceeds of approximately $16.0 million in cash from the
sale of Global Thermoelectric Inc. (Global) on May 28, 2004. Excluding the
proceeds from the Global sale, cash used during the quarter was $17.9 million,
which included $2.0 million related to the Canadian operations and $3.4 million
of capital expenditures.

Capital expenditures were primarily for two City of Santa Barbara power purchase
agreement power plants and one DFC300A for the Department of Defense (DoD) Fuel
Cell Test and Evaluation Center (FCTec). Depreciation and amortization expense
from continuing operations for the three-month period ended July 31, 2004 was
approximately $2.4 million.

For the nine months ended July 31, 2004, FuelCell Energy reported a total net
loss of $65.7 million or $1.37 per basic and diluted share, including net income
from discontinued operations of $0.8 million or $0.02 per basic and diluted
share. This compares to a net loss of $52.0 million, or $1.32 per basic and
diluted share, during the nine months ended July 31, 2003. Included in the 2004
total net loss was a one-time charge of $12.2 million, or $0.25 per basic and
diluted share, related to purchased in-process research and development expense
from the acquisition of Global in November 2003. Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted
Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share were $53.5 million and $1.12 per share,
respectively (see reconciliation chart included in the financial tables).

Components of revenue and costs for the third quarter and year to date of fiscal
2004 were as follows:

      o     Research and development contract revenue for the third quarter of
            fiscal 2004 was $4.4 million compared to $4.7 million in the same
            period a year ago and $14.9 million compared to $14.3 million for
            the nine month period ended July 31, 2003. For the third quarter and
            year to date, the Company's revenues increased on the Product Design
            Improvement, Vision 21 and Solid State Energy Conversion Alliance
            (SECA) contracts with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). These
            increases were offset by a decline in revenue related to the
            completion of the Company's first two-megawatt DFC3000 power plant
            under the Clean Coal contract. The cost of research and development
            contract revenue declined by $2.2 million in the third quarter of
            fiscal 2004 and $6.5 million for the nine month ended July 31, 2004
            compared to similar periods in 2003 due to the mix of cost shared
            contracts.

      o     Fuel cell product sales were $3.6 million for the third quarter of
            fiscal 2004 compared to $2.6 million in the same period of a year
            ago. Revenue during the quarter ended July 31, 2004 was higher than
            the previous year primarily due to progress on power plants for
            Marubeni and Caterpillar customers. Year to date fuel cell product
            sales were $7.6 million for fiscal 2004 compared to $12.2 million in
            fiscal 2003. Product sales backlog totaled $25.4 million as of July
            31, 2004 compared with $17.1 million for the same period a year ago.

Administrative and selling expenses were $3.4 million and $10.9 million,
respectively, for the three months and nine months ended July 31, 2004 compared
to $3.2 million and $9.6 million in the same periods of the prior year. This
increase was primarily due to Canadian operations and higher sales and marketing
costs over the prior year.

Research and development expenses for the three and nine months ended July 31,
2004 were $6.7 million and $19.0 million, respectively, compared to $2.0 million
and $6.1 million for the same periods of the prior year. Of these increases,
approximately $1.7 million (three months ended July 31, 2004) and $6.8 million
(nine months ended July 31, 2004) were related to solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)
research and development costs in Canada. The remaining increases in the three
and nine month periods ended July 31, 2004 were primarily related to product
development including the Company's cost reduction program implemented in fiscal
2003. These continuing efforts are expected to reduce product costs to increase
market penetration.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS

"We continue to execute our strategy of establishing positions in key target
customer segments that demonstrate the performance and reliability of our DFC
power plants, while focusing on driving cost out of our products, that will lead
to sustainable order flow," said Jerry D. Leitman, Chairman and CEO of FuelCell
Energy. "We believe that working with a strong global network of distribution
partners, now expanded to include LOGANEnergy, certifying our products,
including our efforts on the DFC1500 for California emissions standards and
cooperating with the Department of Defense to develop high reliability
government and military applications furthers implementation of our strategy."

      o     FuelCell Energy began operating its first one-megawatt DFC1500 power
            plant at the King County Wastewater Treatment Facility in Washington
            State on natural gas at full load in July 2004. It has completed
            testing requirements for the California Air Resources Board (CARB)
            2007 distributed generation emission standards and the Company's
            certification application is currently being reviewed. In 2003,
            FuelCell Energy's DFC300A power plant was certified under the CARB
            2007 standards, which categorized it as an 'ultra-clean' technology
            and exempted it from air pollution control or air quality district
            permitting requirements by CARB. In addition, this certification
            qualified the Company's products for preferential rate treatment by
            the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) including the
            elimination of 'exit fees' and 'standby charges' for customer
            electric generation, and for project funding through the California
            Self Generation Incentive Program.

      o     FuelCell Energy shipped five DFC300A power plants to four U.S.
            customers - Sanitation Districts of L.A. County and American
            Municipal Power-Ohio for Caterpillar customers; two units for the
            City of Santa Barbara and one unit for the DoD FCTec. The Company
            has generated more than 45 million kilowatt-hours of electricity at
            35 customer installations worldwide and its current fleet produces
            over 60 million kilowatt hours of electricity annually. The
            operational availability continues to meet customer expectations for
            a non-legacy product. FuelCell Energy expects to ship another four
            to six DFC300A power plants to U.S. and Japanese customers by the
            end of fiscal year 2004.

      o     FuelCell Energy and Roswell, Georgia-based LOGANEnergy Corp. (LOGAN)
            entered into a Market Development Agreement to develop and sell
            commercial fuel cell power plants, with a focus on megawatt-class
            systems in California. FuelCell Energy will provide the DFC power
            plants along with engineering and technical support while LOGAN will
            contribute its expertise in planning, designing, developing and
            implementing fuel cell projects. LOGAN currently has fuel cell
            projects at 21 U.S. locations and one project in the United Kingdom.

      o     FuelCell Energy entered into a Cooperative Research and Development
            Agreement (CRADA) with the U. S. Army Engineer Research and
            Development Center/Construction Engineering Research Laboratory
            (ERDC-CERL) to provide a 250-kilowatt DFC power plant to the DoD
            FCTec for evaluation in a combined heat and power application. This
            distributed generation fuel cell system will supply electricity, and
            the byproduct heat will be coupled with an absorption chiller.

      o     During a "town hall" meeting today in Torrington with FuelCell
            Energy employees, U.S. Congressman Larson announced federal funding
            for dual-fuel carbonate fuel cell projects in the Department of
            Defense Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2005. Defense
            Appropriations (PL 108-287) includes a total of $7 million for
            carbonate fuel cell projects. The Company expects the funding to
            result in definitive contracts employing the firm's DFC products to
            meet the military's desire for power in critical applications.

      o     The power plant shipped to the FCTec is the same unit that
            accomplished a number of firsts when it operated in Boston at the
            Democratic National Convention, where it supplied electric power to
            a temporary media campus:

            o     First DFC power plant to operate in a customer micro-grid--a
                  distributed generation system that operates independently from
                  the local utility's transmission and distribution
                  infrastructure;

            o     First DFC power plant to operate in parallel with diesel
                  generators; and,

            o     First DFC power plant to automatically operate in islanded
                  mode (separate from the micro-grid).

ABOUT DIRECT FUELCELLS

Direct FuelCells efficiently generate clean electricity at distributed customer
locations, including hospitals, schools, universities, hotels and other
commercial and industrial facilities, as well as in grid-support applications
for utility customers. Direct FuelCells operate similar to large, continuously
operating batteries except they utilize a fuel to generate electricity, such as
natural gas or digester gas from wastewater treatment facilities. DFC power
plants are hydrogen generators, and because of this are ready today and do not
require the creation of a hydrogen infrastructure. This high-efficiency
technology generates more electric power from less fuel and with less carbon
dioxide emissions than traditional combustion methods. The sub-megawatt fuel
cell power plant is a collaborative effort using Direct FuelCell(R) technology
of FuelCell Energy and the Hot Module(R) balance of plant design of MTU CFC
Solutions, GmbH, a subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler.

NOTES

(1)   There are no adjustments to net loss for the three months ended July 30,
      2004 and 2003, respectively. "Adjusted Net Loss" and "Adjusted Basic and
      Diluted Loss Per Share" are defined as reported net loss and reported
      basic and diluted loss per share excluding the impact of the purchased
      in-process research and development charge taken in conjunction with the
      acquisition of Global during the three months ended January 31, 2004.
      These are not GAAP financial measures.

o     On November 3, 2003, FuelCell Energy completed the acquisition of Global
      Thermoelectric Inc. (Global) and combined operations. The acquisition has
      been accounted for as a purchase under accounting principles generally
      accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and therefore FuelCell
      Energy's financial data prior to the acquisition has not been restated to
      include Global's financial data. Global's financial results have been
      reported in FuelCell Energy's financial reporting beginning on November 3,
      2003.

o     As required by Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 4,
      "Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted
      for by the Purchase Method ("FIN 4")", the portion of the purchase price
      allocated to in-process research and development (related to Global's
      research of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells) of $12.2 million was expensed in the
      three-month period ended January 31, 2004. Purchased in-process research
      and development is excluded from Adjusted net loss as this is a one-time
      charge to the purchase accounting of our acquisition of Global.

o     The Company has used non-GAAP pro forma financial measures in analyzing
      financial results because they provide meaningful information regarding
      the Company's operational performance and facilitate management's internal
      comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons
      to competitors' operating results. The Company believes that these
      non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow for
      greater transparency.

o     These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial
      measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not
      be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial
      performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
