    Spectrum Control, Inc. (Nasdaq: SPEC), a leading designer and manufacturer
of electronic control products and systems, today reported results for the
third quarter ended August 31, 2004.
    For the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company reported net income of
$997,000 or eight cents per share on sales of $20,180,000, compared to net
income of $29,000 or zero cents per share on sales of $15,354,000 for the same
period last year. For the first nine months of fiscal 2004, the Company had
net income of $3,137,000 or 24 cents per share on sales of $58,789,000. For
the comparable period of 2003, the Company had net income of $445,000 or three
cents per share on sales of $46,070,000.
    Dick Southworth, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer
commented, "Compared to last year, our overall operating performance continues
to significantly improve. Total customer orders received in the third quarter
amounted to $20.0 million, an increase of $4.4 million or 29% from a year ago.
Demand for our signal integrity products was particularly strong, with
customer orders received in the current quarter of $13.4 million, an increase
of $3.7 million or 38% from the comparable quarter of 2003. Our signal
integrity products are used in numerous applications and industries including
telecommunications, military, aerospace, automotive, and medical. Total
shipments in the current quarter grew to $20.2 million, an increase of
$4.8 million or 31% from a year ago. The higher shipment level, combined with
our continuous implementation of cost reduction programs, enhanced our
profitability by improving efficiencies and enabling us to leverage our fixed
manufacturing costs. Income from operations was $1.6 million during the
current quarter, compared to a virtual breakeven level for the same quarter
last year. We expect to build upon our improved financial performance, as we
strive to achieve and maintain dynamic growth and significant shareholder
value."

    Quarter Highlights
    Positive Impact of Acquisition
    On February 27, 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of
Salisbury Engineering, Inc. ("SEI"). SEI, based in Delmar Delaware, designs
and manufactures a full line of radio frequency and microwave components and
systems used primarily in military and aerospace applications. SEI's current
products include microwave synthesizers, multiple channel filter banks and
preselectors, and global positioning system amplifiers. These complex systems
incorporate advance technologies and significantly expand our microwave
capabilities. In addition, SEI's microwave component offerings (miniature chip
filters, lumped element filters, band reject filters, cavity filters, and
waveguides) are a natural complement to our existing frequency control product
offerings. The aggregate cash purchase price for SEI was approximately
$5.6 million, including legal fees and other costs directly related to the
acquisition. The purchase price was entirely funded through our cash reserves.
    We have successfully integrated this acquisition into our Frequency
Control Products Group, with SEI being accretive to our overall profitability
while generating $1.1 million of shipments in the third quarter of fiscal 2004
and total year-to-date shipments of $2.4 million.

    Improved Profit Margins
    In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, gross margin was $5.6 million or
27.6% of sales, compared to $3.0 million or 19.6% of sales for the third
quarter of last year. This improvement primarily reflects decreases in
manufacturing overhead costs, from numerous cost reduction programs, and
economies of scale realized with additional production and shipment volumes.
Total manufacturing overhead expense was $6.9 million or 34.0% of sales in the
third quarter of fiscal 2004, versus $6.3 million or 41.3% of sales for the
comparable period of 2003.

    Strong Cash Flow and Liquidity
    Our operating cash flow and liquidity remain strong. Despite increased
working capital requirements, net cash generated by operating activities
amounted to $6.1 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2004, an
increase of $821,000 or 15.6% from the comparable period a year ago. As a
result of increased shipments and production requirements during the first
nine months of fiscal 2004, accounts receivable and inventories increased by
$1.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively, excluding the impact of our SEI
acquisition. Our total cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third
quarter were $23.3 million, and our total borrowed funds were only
$2.1 million.

    Current Business Outlook
    Mr. Southworth stated, "Our third quarter sales and earnings were below
our previous expectations of $22.0 million and 12 cents per share,
respectively. This shortfall reflects a softening of demand experienced
throughout the passive components industry. Although we believe this market
softening is temporary, and market conditions will improve in the fourth
quarter and beyond, the third quarter softening illustrates the short-term
volatility and unpredictability of our major markets. Accordingly, we are not
in a position to provide any specific guidance regarding our fourth quarter
sales and profitability expectations. However as we have demonstrated in each
quarter of the current fiscal year, we expect our fourth quarter 2004 sales
and profitability to significantly exceed the comparable period performance of
2003. On a long-term basis, we firmly believe that we are strategically
positioned for strong annual sales growth and enhanced profitability," he
concluded.
