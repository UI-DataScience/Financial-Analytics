                WARRANTECH REPORTS FISCAL 2004 FINANCIAL RESULTS


BEDFORD, Texas - Aug. 24, 2004 - Warrantech Corporation (OTC: WTEC), a leading
independent provider of service contracts and after-market warranties, announced
that it has filed its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2004 which
reports the company's financial results for the year.

         The filing of this report followed discussions which began more than
one year ago between the company and the staff at the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC). During these discussions the company sought guidance from the
SEC staff concerning revenue recognition policies, including a new accounting
pronouncement which became effective for transactions after June 30, 2003.

         Based upon the guidance received from the SEC staff, Warrantech now
recognizes

FY 2004 Financial Results

revenues over the life of the service contracts which it administers. Despite
Warrantech's cash flow generating power, the new revenue recognition
pronouncement makes it unlikely that the company will reflect a profit until
fiscal 2008. While there can be no assurance of profit in fiscal 2008, if
business remains at current levels, the company expects revenues recognized from
prior periods will equal the revenue being deferred to future periods.

         For the twelve months ended March 31, 2004, the company is showing a
net loss of $0.5 million or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to net income of
$1.5 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the fiscal year 2003, with $229.5
million of gross revenues not being recognized and being deferred to future
periods.

         "Despite the reported loss, Warrantech's business grew in fiscal 2004,"
said Joel San Antonio, Warrantech chairman and chief executive officer. "The
growth was driven by our international and consumer service divisions, while
revenues from our automotive segment were lower. Overall gross revenues
increased from $118.1 million in 2002 to $147.8 million in 2003 and $149.3
million in fiscal 2004. Over that same period, selling, general and
administrative expenses decreased."

         "Warrantech's positive gross revenue growth and cost management were
obscured by the new accounting policies which require that the majority of
revenue from new contract sales must be deferred to future periods. Reporting a
net loss when revenues increased and expenses were down is confusing, yet these
results are due to the new accounting policies. However, our mission remains
clear: Warrantech will continue creating and delivering a range of innovative
products

while maximizing the service experience to the consumer," San Antonio said.


Gross Revenues

         Gross revenues for the year ended March 31, 2004, were $149.3 million,
an increase of 2 percent, compared to $146.8 million for the same period last
year. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2004, the international segment had
gross revenues of $7.7 million, an increase of 44 percent compared to $5.4
million in the corresponding period a year ago. For the twelve-month period
ended March 31, 2004, consumer products reported gross revenues of $39.0
million, up 16 percent compared to $33.7 million in the previous year. For the
twelve months ended March 31, 2004, the automotive segment had gross revenues of
$103.5 million, down 4 percent compared to $108.0 million in the prior year.


Direct Costs

         Direct costs are expenses related to the production and acquisition of
service contracts. These costs consist primarily of insurance premiums and
commission expenses. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, direct costs were
$87.4 million, up 40% compared with $62.5 million in fiscal 2003.


Service, Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A)

         For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, SG&A expenses were $29.9
million, down $0.7

million or 2 percent from $30.6 million in the prior year. The decrease in SG&A
expense was attributed to a rigorous cost containment program, increased
reliance on new technology, and a decrease in legal expense resulting from the
settlement of several lawsuits during fiscal 2003. Employee and payroll expenses
were $17.8 million, up 2 percent due to a rise in health care costs during
fiscal 2004 compared to $17.5 million during the same period a year ago. Rent
expense increased to $2.2 million for fiscal 2004, compared to $1.9 million for
fiscal 2003, a result of the company's move to the new corporate headquarters in
Bedford, Texas. Over time, rent expense is expected to diminish as operations
were consolidated into one facility.


Income (Loss) from Operations

         For the twelve months ended March 31, 2004, loss from operations was
$1.3 million, compared to income from operations of $1.1 million in the prior
year.

         These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and
assumptions, including, but not limited to, (a) prevailing economic conditions
which may significantly deteriorate, thereby reducing the demand for the
company's products and services, (b) availability of technical support personnel
or increases in the rate of turnover of such personnel, resulting from increased
demand for such qualified personnel, (c) changes in the terms or availability of
insurance coverage for the company's programs, (d) regulatory or legal changes
affecting the company's business, (e) loss of business from, or significant
change in relationships with any major customer, (f) the ability to successfully

non-payment of notes due from an officer and two directors of the company in
2007 which would result in a charge against earnings in the period in which the
event occurred, (j) the inability of any of the insurance companies which insure
the service contracts marketed and administered by the company to pay the claims
under the service contracts, (k) the termination of extended credit terms being
provided by the company's current insurance company, (l) the development of
facts and circumstances which could affect existing accounting policies, and (m)
the illiquidity of the company's common stock. Should one or more of these or
any other risks or uncertainties materialize or develop in a manner adverse to
the company, or should the company's underlying assumptions prove incorrect,
actual results of operations, cash flows or the company's financial condition
may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or expected and there
could be a materially adverse effect on the company's business.
