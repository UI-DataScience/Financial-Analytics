of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed

On September 30, 2004, Tupperware Corporation issued a release reporting higher
expectations for the third quarter and streamlining of the Tupperware U.S.

Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.

On September 30, 2004, Tupperware Corporation (the Company) committed to a
workforce restructuring plan in its Tupperware United States business. The
business model associated with the implementation of a change in the Company's
U.S. sales force compensation plan allows for a reduction in company-performed
tasks necessary to support the business, primarily in the sales and marketing
area. The resulting streamlined organization will be appropriate under the
revised business model and for the current sales level. This action will result
in the elimination 28 staffed positions and several others currently open.
Pretax cash severance payments will total approximately $900,000 and be paid out
beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004 and extending into the second quarter of
2005. An additional $100,000 will also be paid for outplacement assistance,
primarily in the fourth quarter. Following this action, annualized cost savings
of approximately $2.7 million are expected to be realized.

       Tupperware Announces Higher Expectation for Third Quarter Results
                         and U.S. Business Streamlining

    ORLANDO, Fla., Sept. 30 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Tupperware Corporation
(NYSE: TUP) announced today that it expects to report third quarter 2004
diluted earnings per share of 16 - 18 cents, reflecting net income of
$9.2 - $10.8 million.  The quarter is expected to include 11 cents from a gain
on land development and three cents of re-engineering costs.  Excluding these
items, diluted earnings per share is expected to be 8 - 10 cents compared with
breakeven last year.

    The 16 - 18 cents in the third quarter would be 10 - 11 cents higher than
the outlook given in July.  A major component of the improvement is
5 - 6 cents of higher earnings from the Company's segments, mainly Europe and
Asia Pacific.  Additionally, lower than foreseen third quarter re-engineering
costs, interest expense and income taxes contribute to the improvement, along
with a slightly higher gain on land development.

    Third quarter 2004 sales are expected to be up slightly versus the 2003
quarter, although down slightly excluding the favorable impact of foreign
exchange on the comparison.

    Today, the Company announced a headcount reduction in its Tupperware U.S.
business and will record a re-engineering charge in the fourth quarter of
approximately $1.0 million for cash severance costs.  The resulting
streamlined organization will be appropriate under the Company's new sales
force compensation plan and to align its cost structure with the current sales
level.  Annualized savings from these actions are expected to be approximately
$2.7 million.  This is incremental to previously announced value chain
improvements.

    After considering anticipated third quarter results and its current
business trends and plans, the Company is confirming its previous full-year
outlook range of $1.28 - $1.38 per diluted share.  The Company expects to
narrow this range upon reporting third quarter results on October 18, 2004.
This outlook reflects the continuation of good results in BeautiControl North
America, Latin America and many Asia Pacific markets.  It also reflects
continued weakness in the United States and Japan and lower productivity
evidenced through fewer parties in Germany during its Fall promotional period.
Included in this outlook is 13 cents of gains on land development, which have
already been realized through the third quarter, and six cents of re-
engineering costs.

    The Company expects an insurance recovery associated with hurricane damage
at its Orlando headquarters.  The amount to be recovered is expected to be
agreed upon by year-end 2004 and reflected in fourth quarter results; however,
no estimate is included in the outlook range.

    "We have taken these actions in our U.S. business as part of an ongoing
effort to improve our value chain while we rebuild the sales force through
implementation of the Taste of Tupperware Party and our new sales force
compensation plan," said Rick Goings, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
"We are pleased with our results this quarter and to be able to confirm our
full-year guidance range."

    Tupperware will announce its third quarter earnings on October 18, 2004
and a conference call will be held at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time.  If you would
like to participate in the call, please dial 913-981-5510, about five minutes

predictive words such as "outlook" or "target" are forward-looking statements.
These statements involve risks and uncertainties which include recruiting and
activity of the Company's independent sales forces, the success of new product

    Non-GAAP Financial Measures

    The Company has utilized non-GAAP financial measures in this release,
which are provided to assist in investors' understanding of the Company's
results of operations. The adjustment items materially impact the
comparability of the Company's results of operations. The adjusted information
is intended to be more indicative of Tupperware's primary operations, and is
intended to assist investors in evaluating performance and analyzing trends
across periods.  The non-GAAP financial measures exclude gains on land
development.  While the Company is engaged in a multi-year program to sell
land for development, this activity is not part of the Company's primary
business operation.  Additionally, the gains recognized in any given period
are not necessarily indicative of gains which may be recognized in any
particular future period.  For this reason, these gains are excluded from
indicated earnings per share amounts.  Also, the Company periodically records
exit costs as defined under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities", and
believes these amounts are similarly volatile and impact the comparability of
earnings across quarters.  Therefore, they are also excluded from indicated
earnings per share calculations to provide what the Company believes
represents a more useful measure for analysis and predictive purposes.
