         Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania,  August  25,  2004  - SE  Financial  Corp.

31, 2003.  Per share  figures are not  applicable  to the quarter ended and nine

2004 compared to $539.1 thousand for the three months ended July 31, 2003.

         For the nine months  ended July 31,  2004,  net  interest  income after
provision for loan losses totaled $2.2 million  compared to $2.0 million for the
nine months ended July 31, 2003. This increase is attributable to an increase in
the average  balance of  interest-earning  assets to $95.6  million for the nine
months ended July 31, 2004  compared to $82.9  million for the nine months ended
July 31, 2003. Non-interest income was $270.7 thousand for the nine months ended
July 31, 2004  compared to $297.1  thousand  for the nine months  ended July 31,
2003.  Non-interest  expense was $1.8 million for the nine months ended July 31,
2004 compared to $1.7 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2003.

         Total  assets at July 31,  2004 were $118.2  million  compared to $87.4
million at October 31, 2003, an increase of $30.8  million,  or 35.3%.  Cash and
cash equivalents decreased to $2.3 million at July 31, 2004 from $6.3 million at
October 31, 2003.  Investment  securities  available for sale increased to $52.7
million at July 31,  2004 from $27.3  million at  October  31,  2003.  Net loans
increased $7.0 million,  or 13.8%,  to $57.8 million at July 31, 2004 from $50.7
million at October 31, 2003.  Deposits  decreased  to $69.5  million at July 31,

million at July 31, 2004 from $6.6 million at October 31, 2003.

         Frank S. DePaolo,  President and Chief Executive Officer,  stated, "The
third  quarter  results  continue  to  show  significant   earnings  growth.  As
previously reported, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $.02 per
share  payable on or about  September 20, 2004 to  stockholders  of record as of
