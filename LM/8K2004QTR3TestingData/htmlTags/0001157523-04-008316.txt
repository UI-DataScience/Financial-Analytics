Exhibit 99.1

Norstan Reports First Quarter Fiscal 2005 Results; Operating Income
Totaled $2.4 Million EPS of $0.09 Per Share

    MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 7, 2004--Norstan, Inc.
(Nasdaq:NRRD), a leading provider of communications solutions and
services, today reported revenues of $54.4 million for the first
quarter ended July 31, 2004, versus $56.9 million reported in the
first quarter of fiscal 2004. First quarter operating income totaled
$2.4 million compared with an operating loss of $2.9 million in the
first quarter of fiscal 2004. The company reported first quarter net
income of $1.2 million, or $0.09 per share, versus a first quarter net
loss of $1.9 million, or $0.15 per share. Gross margin of 29.6 percent
improved from 28.1 percent one year ago.
    During the quarter, Norstan sold the assets and intellectual
property related to Norstan CDG to IPcelerate, Inc., a privately held
developer of Voice over IP (VoIP) applications, for $2.5 million in
cash and promissory notes, and the assumption by the purchaser of
approximately $400,000 in liabilities. Pursuant to the terms of the
purchase agreement, the company received $1.25 million at closing and
$1.25 million evidenced by non-interest promissory notes in favor of
Norstan ($1.05 million due January 30, 2005 and $200,000 due February
28, 2005). Norstan recorded a pre-tax gain of $88,000 from the sale in
the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The company believes it can continue
to offer its customers access to VoIP applications without the
development expenses associated with the on-going operations of the
CDG business.
    "We are pleased with our first quarter performance," said Scott G.
Christian, Norstan's president and CEO. "While our revenues were down
modestly over last year, the quality of our revenues has improved, as
reflected in higher gross margins. Our efforts to properly size our
business have continued to improve results; our operating
profitability has strengthened and cash flow has improved steadily."
    The company's expense structure continued to improve in the first
quarter of fiscal 2005. SG&A expenses decreased 3.1 percent
sequentially and 27.2 percent year-over-year as a result of the
company's fiscal 2004 restructuring initiatives. This significant
reduction in spending was somewhat offset by the recording of $1.5
million in incentive compensation costs accrued during the first
quarter of fiscal 2005.
    EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization) from continuing operations for the first quarter of
fiscal 2005 totaled $4.3 million, an improvement from negative EBITDA
of $691,000 reported in the first quarter of last year. Sequentially,
EBITDA remained steady as compared to the $4.4 million reported in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, excluding restructuring and other
charges.

    Sequential Results

    First quarter fiscal 2005 revenues declined modestly from the
$57.5 million reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Gross
margin totaled 29.6 percent compared to the 29.2 percent reported last
quarter. Operating income of $2.4 million showed significant
improvement from the $6.8 million operating loss reported last
quarter. Net income also improved from the $4.6 million loss, or $0.35
per share, reported last quarter. Norstan recorded $9.4 million in
pre-tax restructuring and other charges during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004.

    Fiscal 2005 Outlook

    Norstan's management believes it prudent not to provide
forward-looking financial guidance for fiscal 2005. However, as the
company's strategic focus has changed from one of higher revenue
through aggressive growth, Norstan is focusing in fiscal 2005 on
profitability through several initiatives, such as improving gross
margins, delivering advanced business applications, driving additional
sales to its existing customer base, selectively developing new
business in certain technologies and continued development of our
Resale Services business. This change in strategic focus may result in
lower revenues but deliver higher profitability and cash flow in
fiscal 2005 than in fiscal 2004.

    Conference Call and Webcast

    Norstan will discuss its first quarter fiscal year results on a
conference call scheduled today, September 7, at 5 p.m. Eastern time.
