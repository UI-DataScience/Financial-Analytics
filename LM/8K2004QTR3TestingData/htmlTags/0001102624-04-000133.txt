Financial Results for First Quarter ending July 31, 2004
<br>
<br>On September 2, 2004, the Company announced financial results for the quarter ended July 31, 2004. A copy of the Company's press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
<br>
<br>The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K and the Exhibit attached hereto shall not be deemed to be filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 or 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The information contained herein and in the accompanying Exhibit shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing with the SEC made by Finisar Corporation whether before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language contained in such filing.
<br>
<br>The Company provides in the press release and conference call certain non-GAAP financial measures. As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude from the directly comparable GAAP measures a number of non-cash and cash charges described in the press release. As required by Regulation G, the press release contains a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide an alternative method for measuring the operating performance of the Company's business, excluding certain items that would normally be included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company's operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be co
nsidered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as reported by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled items reported by other companies.

<p></p>
<b>Finisar Corporation Announces Results for First Quarter Ended July 31, 2004</b>
<p>SUNNYVALE, CA -- 09/02/2004 --  Finisar Corporation (NASDAQ: FNSR), a
technology leader in gigabit fiber optic solutions for high-speed data
networks, today reported its financial results for its first quarter ended
July 31, 2004.
</p>
<p>
Finisar plans to review its first quarter results and discuss its current
outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2005 during its conference call for
investors at 5:00 p.m. EDT (2:00 p.m. PDT) today, September 2, 2004.  The
call will be broadcast live over the Internet on the Investor Relations
section of Finisar's web site, located at www.Finisar.com.  To listen to
the Webcast, interested investors are encouraged to log onto the broadcast
at least 15 minutes prior to the call. Participating in the call will be
Jerry Rawls, Finisar's President and CEO, and Steve Workman, Finisar's CFO.
</p>
<p>
Total revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 of $61.9 million were up
9% on a sequential basis from $57.0 million in the fourth quarter and 57%
from $39.4 million in the first quarter of the prior year. Total revenues
from the sale of optical subsystems of $53.8 million in the first quarter
were up 11% on a sequential basis from $48.7 million in the fourth quarter
and 57% from $34.2 million in the first quarter of the prior year. Sales of
network test and monitoring systems of $8.1 million in the first quarter
were down 3% on a sequential basis from $8.3 million in the fourth quarter
but up 55% from $5.2 million in the first quarter of the prior year.
</p>
<p>
Revenues in the first quarter included a full quarter of operating results
of the VCSEL business unit acquired from Honeywell on March 2, 2004.
Excluding the impact of this acquisition, total revenues were up 4% on a
sequential basis from the fourth quarter and 33% from the first quarter of
the prior year.
</p>
<p>
"Our revenues for the quarter increased as we had predicted at the
beginning of the quarter.   Achieving this increase was not easy because of
the softness in our LAN/SAN business during the early portion of the
quarter," said Jerry Rawls. "More recently, we have seen a resurgence of
orders for both our LAN/SAN and Metro business. This combined with the
recent acquisition of Data Transit which fills a gap in our Network Tools
business should result in another sequential increase in sales for next
quarter."
</p>
<p>
"Gross margins on a non-GAAP basis improved to 26% in the first quarter
from 22% last quarter," added Rawls. "Higher operating expenses offset much
of this improvement due in part to a number of non-recurring charges
related to new product introductions."
</p>
<p>
OPERATING RESULTS
</p>
<p>
The Company reported a net loss of $22.1 million, or $0.10 per share, for
the first quarter of fiscal 2005, compared to a net loss of $24.5 million,
or $0.11 per share, in the fourth quarter and a net loss of $41.2 million,
or $0.20 per share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. A gross profit of
$10.6 million, or 17.1% of revenues, during the first quarter of fiscal
2005, compared to $9.4 million, or 16.5% of revenues, in the fourth quarter
and a loss of $1.7 in the first quarter of the prior year.
</p>
<p>
Amortization of acquired developed technology, amortization of purchased
intangibles, purchased research and development in-process, other
acquisition costs and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
related to the adoption of SFAS 142 consist of merger-related costs
associated with several acquisitions completed during fiscal 2001 through
2004.
</p>
<p>
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL RESULTS
</p>
<p>
The Company provides non-GAAP financial measures to complement its
consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. These
non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the user's overall
understanding of the Company's current financial performance and its
prospects for the future. Specifically, the Company believes the non-GAAP
results provide useful information to both management and investors by
identifying certain expenses, gains and losses that, when excluded from the
GAAP results, may provide additional understanding of the Company's core
operating results or business performance. However, these non-GAAP
financial measures are not intended to supercede or replace the Company's
GAAP results. A detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP results to the GAAP
results is provided in the "Non-GAAP Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Operations" schedules below.
</p>
<p>
Operating results reported on a non-GAAP basis exclude a number of non-cash
and cash charges related to deferred compensation, acquisitions, minority
investments, inventory obsolescence, a discount associated with the
Company's convertible debt offering in October 2001 and inducements
associated with the conversion of a portion of the notes, the loss realized
upon the closure of certain facilities and the accelerated depreciation on
certain assets abandoned in connection with those closures, along with
other restructuring charges, and a non-cash charge representing research
and development in-process related to the acquisition of Honeywell's VCSEL
Business Unit.
</p>
<p>
The Company reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 26.1% in the first quarter
of fiscal 2005 compared to 21.9% in the prior quarter and 27.9% in the
first quarter of the prior year. The improvement on a sequential basis
reflects higher revenue levels and the favorable impact of acquiring the
VCSEL business unit from Honeywell in the fourth quarter as well as
continued improvement in yields and reduced material costs.
</p>
<p>
The Company reported a non-GAAP net loss of $14.3 million, or $.06 per
share, in the first quarter compared to $14.2 million, or $.06 per share,
in the fourth quarter and $12.6 million, or $.06 per share, in the first
quarter of the prior year. The Company does not intend to recognize any
further tax benefits until it returns to profitability.

SAFE HARBOR UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
</p>
<p>
The statements contained in this press release that are not purely
historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements
regarding Finisar's expectations, beliefs, intentions, or strategies
regarding the future. All forward-looking statements included in this press
release are based upon information available to Finisar as of the date
hereof, and Finisar assumes no obligation to update any such
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and
uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from
those projected. These risks include those associated with the rapidly
evolving markets for Finisar's products and uncertainty regarding the
development of these markets; Finisar's historical dependence on sales to a
limited number of customers and fluctuations in the mix of customers in any
period; ongoing new product development and introduction of new and
enhanced products; the challenges of rapid growth followed by periods of
contraction; intensive competition; and potential problems related to the
assimilation and integration of the operations, technologies and products
of several recently acquired companies and product lines, including the
Honeywell VCSEL business unit acquired in March 2004 as well as our pending
acquisition of the fiber optics business unit of Infineon Technologies
A.G., that we expect to complete in the fourth calendar quarter of 2004.
Other risks relating to Finisar's business are set forth in Finisar's
Annual Report on Form 10-K and other interim reports as filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

The following non-GAAP financial results for the three month periods ended
July 31, 2004 and 2003, have been adjusted to exclude non-cash and cash
charges related to acquisitions and the writedown in goodwill as a result
of adoption of FASB 142, deferred stock compensation, the amortization of
acquired developed technology and other intangible assets associated with a
number of acquisitions, the sale of assets of the Company's Sensors
Unlimited subsidiary, inventory obsolescence, other non-recurring gains and
losses, the impairment of certain assets and restructuring costs at the
Company's Demeter Technologies subsidiary, the write-off of minority

investments, amortization of the discount on the issuance of convertible
debt and the non-cash charge associated with the conversion of a portion of
convertible securities into equity. A reconciliation of these results to
what is reported under GAAP is also included.
