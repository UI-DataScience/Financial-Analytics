FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

                         THE TOPPS COMPANY, INC. REPORTS
                       FISCAL 2005 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS

New York, NY, September 23, 2004 - The Topps Company, Inc. (Nasdaq:  TOPP) today
reported  financial  results for the fiscal 2005 second quarter ended August 28,
2004.

Net sales in the fiscal 2005 second quarter were $68.8 million compared to $73.3
million last year.  Stronger foreign  currencies versus the prior year increased
2005 second  quarter  sales by $1.3  million.  Income from  operations  was $4.8
million  compared to $7.6 million in last year's second  quarter.  Net income in
the fiscal 2005 second  quarter was $3.7  million,  or $0.09 per diluted  share,
versus $5.3 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, last year.

For the six months ended August 28, 2004, net sales were $156.9 million compared
to $149.3  million in the same period  last year.  Stronger  foreign  currencies
versus the prior year increased sales for the first six months of fiscal 2005 by
$4.1  million.  Income from  operations  was $10.5  million  compared with $11.9
million in the  prior-year  period.  Net income in the first half of fiscal 2005
was $7.8 million,  or $0.19 per diluted share, versus $8.8 million, or $0.21 per
diluted  share,  last  year.  Results  for the first six  months of fiscal  2005
include a one-time charge of $1.9 million,  or  approximately  $0.05 per diluted
share incurred in the first quarter,  related to a previously disclosed European
Commission fine.

Confectionery net sales were $40.0 million in the fiscal 2005 second quarter,  a
4.8%  decrease from the  prior-year  period.  The decline stems from U.S.  candy
performance,  as the  Company  works to address  the impact of  industry  trends
including retailer consolidation, increased promotional spending including price
discounting and childhood nutritional concerns.

Entertainment  sales in the second quarter were $28.8 million,  representing  an
8.0% decline from the prior year's quarter.  The decrease was largely a function
of the  Company's  decision  not to  release  hockey  cards  due to  uncertainty
regarding the NHL season and  difficult  comparisons  to last year's  basketball
sales,  which  benefited  from a  highly  anticipated  rookie  class.  Sales  of
non-sports  Entertainment products were principally driven by Lord of the Rings,
Garbage  Pail Kids,  Pokemon and  Yu-Gi-Oh.  These sales,  combined  with a full
quarter's contribution from WizKids, partially offset the decline in U.S. sports
cards.

Arthur  T.  Shorin,  Chairman  and CEO of  Topps,  commented,  "We are  actively
addressing  the  challenges  we face in the  U.S.  confectionery  business.  For
example,  in  response  to trade  consolidation,  we are in the final  stages of
realigning our sales organization to focus additional  resources on accounts and
distribution channels that offer the greatest growth potential. As part of a new
go-to-market  strategy,  we are  reviewing  our  mix of  advertising  and  trade
spending dollars and will be testing promotional pricing programs.  With respect
to  nutritional  issues,  we have been  conducting  research  with  children and
parents to determine  more precisely  their  concerns.  Additionally,  packaging
changes have  recently  been made to highlight the juice content and lack of fat
in our products."

Mr.  Shorin  continued,  "On the  product  development  side,  Juicy Drop Pop, a
relatively new confectionery item for Topps, is demonstrating  strength in terms
of consumer  takeaway and should  benefit from ongoing  distribution  gains.  In
addition,  we are continuing our product  refreshment  and  enhancement  efforts
across all of our core brands in an effort to support their vitality."

"Turning to the Entertainment segment of our business, we are working to develop
products  with greater  interactivity  that  leverage our sports  expertise.  In
addition,  we  continue  to build  upon our  successful  non-sports  franchises,
including  Garbage  Pail Kids,  now in its third series in the U.S. and recently
launched  in  France,  as well as Wacky  Packages  which was  reintroduced  last
quarter and will be  supported by  advertising  in the third  quarter.  Finally,
WizKids which outperformed our expectations for the second quarter, has recently
introduced  "Pirates  of the  Spanish  Main," the  world's  first  constructible
strategy  game.  Pirates is showing  good  promise  among  gaming  enthusiasts,"
concluded Mr. Shorin.

shares of stock at an average price of $9.22 per share.  At August 28, 2004, the
