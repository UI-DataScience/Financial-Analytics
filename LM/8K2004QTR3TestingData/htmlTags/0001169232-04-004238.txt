        Robocom Systems International Inc. Reports Financial Results for
                  4th Quarter and the Year ending May 31, 2004

MASSAPEQUA, NY, August 23, 2004 - Robocom Systems International Inc. (OTCBB:
RIMS) announced its results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended May
31, 2004.

For the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004, Robocom reported an increase of 14% in
revenues, to $887,460, from $777,349 in the year ago quarter. For the three
months ended May 31, 2004, software license fees, services and maintenance
revenues all showed increases. Cost of sales, software amortization and selling,
general and administrative expenses all increased for the quarter. This resulted
in an operating income of $127,249, or $0.03 per fully diluted share, as
compared to $289,598, or $.06 per fully diluted share, in the year-ago quarter.

For the year ended May 31, 2004, net income decreased 13% to $421,814 or $.09
per fully diluted share, as compared to $485,590 or $0.11 per fully diluted
share in the prior period. Software license revenues increased by approximately
137% to $546,141 for the year ended May 31, 2004, as compared to $230,127 for
the year ended May 31, 2003. Revenue from services decreased by approximately 7%
and hardware sales decreased by approximately 88%. Maintenance revenue increased
by approximately 3%, as compared to the prior period. Software amortization
declined by 1% and selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 6%.
This resulted in operating income of $438,590, or $0.09 per fully diluted share,
as compared to $517,271, or $0.11 per fully diluted share, in the year-ago
period.

During the period, the Company operated on a positive cash flow basis and,
excluding non-cash expenses, reported a net profit of $1,188,547 or $0.26 per
fully diluted share, compared to a $1,259,596 or $0.28 per fully diluted share
in the year-ago period. "I am very pleased with our year end results, showing an
increase in revenue over 2003's fourth quarter and our continued profitable
operations," said Irwin Balaban, President and CEO.

"Robocom recorded a significant increase in license revenues for the year ending
May 31, 2004 and continued to record net income. This confirms our focus on
sales execution and cost control," said Mr. Balaban. "Although we are still
experiencing the effects of economic uncertainties, we feel our state-of-the-art
software solution, RIMS(TM) Version 5.0 with its enhanced features including
Third Party Billing (Activity Based Costing), support for Global Trade Item
Numbers (GTIN) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) support provides us
