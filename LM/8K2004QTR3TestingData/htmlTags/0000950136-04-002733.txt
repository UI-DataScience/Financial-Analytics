FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

          OPTICARE ANNOUNCES ITS EXPECTED RESTATEMENT OF 2003 FINANCIAL
           STATEMENTS TO REFLECT THE RECLASSIFICATION OF ITS LONG TERM
         DEBT, THE AMENDED TERMS OF ITS LOAN AGREEMENT AND ITS DELAY IN
              FILING FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2004


WATERBURY, Conn., August 23, 2004 -- OptiCare Health Systems, Inc. (Amex: OPT)
announced today that it has conducted a preliminary review of the classification
of its long term debt in its previously reported financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2003 and that the filing of its Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended June 30, 2004 will be delayed pending completion of this review
and the previously announced review of its accounting for inventory and the
restatement of its financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2004.

The company now believes its classification as a long term liability of
approximately $9.7 million and approximately $1.6 million as of December 31,
2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively, owed under its loan agreement with its
senior lender, should be classified as a current liability. In its Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2003, the company reported current portions of
long-term debt of approximately $1.1 million and approximately $1.3 million as
of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively, and long-term debt of
approximately $11.5 million and approximately $2.6 million as of December 31,
2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. The company expects current portions
of long-term debt will be approximately $10.8 million and approximately $2.8
million as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively, and long
term debt will be approximately $1.8 million and approximately $1.0 million as
of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. Accordingly, the
company expects to restate its previously reported financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2003 to reflect the reclassification of the debt. The
company does not expect any change in the net income or loss available to common
stockholders as originally reported for such periods as a result of the expected
restatement. The Company's management now believes that the amounts outstanding
pursuant to certain provisions contained in the credit facility should have been
classified as current liabilities rather than long-term debt, pursuant to the
provisions of consensus 95-22 issued by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board's Emerging Issues Task Force.


<PAGE>

Based upon the review and the expected restatement, the company concluded on
August 17, 2004, that the company's previously reported financial statements for
the year ended December 31, 2003 should no longer be relied upon pending the
filing of its amended Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2003 which the company expects to file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission by September 3, 2004.

The Company has notified and discussed this matter with its independent
registered public accounting firm.

The company previously filed a Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission which extended the due date of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for
the quarter ended June 30, 2004 from August 16, 2004 to August 23, 2004. The
company, however, is delaying the filing of the Form 10-Q to assess the impact
of this restatement and the previously announced restatement of its March 31,
2004 financial statements on the disclosure in the Form 10-Q before it is filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company expects to file the
Form 10-Q as soon as practicable after completion of these restatements, which
the company expects to complete by September 3, 2004.

The company anticipates that in its consolidated statement of operations for the
quarter ended June 30, 2004, it will report total net revenues for the six
months ended June 30, 2004 of approximately $60.3 million, down from
approximately $63.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003. Total net
revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2004 is estimated at approximately
$30.8 million, down from approximately $32.0 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2003. These decreases in total net revenues principally resulted from
decreased revenues at Wise Optical and the Buying Group and lost revenues from
terminated contracts related to Managed Vision. Loss from continuing operations
for the six months ended June 30, 2004 is estimated at approximately $1million,
down from approximately $2.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003.
Loss from continuing operations for the three months ended June 30, 2004 is
estimated at approximately $0.1 million, down from approximately $2.2 million
for the three months ended June 30, 2003. These decreases in loss from
continuing operations principally resulted from the company's efforts to improve
operating results at Wise Optical and the resulting decrease in expenditures.
Net loss to common stockholders for the six months ended June 30, 2004 is
estimated at approximately $2.3 million, which is equal to the net loss to
common stockholders of $2.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003. Net
loss to common stockholders for the three months ended June 30, 2004 is
estimated at approximately $1.1 million, down from approximately $2.3 million
for the three months ended June 30, 2003. These decreases in net loss to common
stockholders principally resulted from the company's efforts to improve
operating results at Wise Optical and the resulting decrease in expenditures.

Additionally, the company stated that on August 16, 2004, the company amended
the terms of its loan agreement with its senior lender. In connection with the
amendment, the company received a waiver from its senior lender for any
non-compliance with the minimum fixed charge ratio covenant under the loan
agreement as of March 31, 2004, April 30, 2004, May 31, 2004 and June 30, 2004
as a result of the restatement of its March 31, 2004 financial statements. The
amendment also amended the loan agreement with its senior lender to, among other
things,

<PAGE>

extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility from January 25, 2006
to January 25, 2007, (ii) provide access to a $2.0 million temporary
over-advance bearing interest at prime plus 5 1/2%, and in no event less than
6%, which is to be repaid in eleven monthly installments of $100,000 commencing
on October 1, 2004 with the remaining balance to be repaid in full by August 31,
2005, which is guaranteed by the company's major stockholder, Palisade
Concentrated Equity Partnership, L.P., (iii) change the fixed charge ratio
covenant from 1.5 to 1 to not less than 1 and to extend the next test period for
this covenant to March 31, 2005, (iv) decrease the minimum tangible net worth
financial covenant from $(2.0) million to $(3.0) million and (v) add a debt
service coverage ratio covenant of between 0.7 to 1.0 beginning October 31, 2004
through February 28, 2005. In addition, the waiver and amendment increased the
termination fee payable if the company terminates the revolving credit facility
by 2% and increased the yield maintenance amount payable, in lieu of the
termination fee, if the Company terminates the revolving credit facility
pursuant to a refinancing with another commercial financial institution, by 2%.
The yield maintenance amount was also changed to mean an amount equal to the
difference between (i) the all-in effective yield which could be earned on the
revolving balance through January 25, 2007 and (ii) the total interest and fees
actually paid to its senior lender on the revolving credit facility prior to the
termination or repayment date. The company paid its senior lender $25,000 in
financing fees in connection with this waiver and amendment.
