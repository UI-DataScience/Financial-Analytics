<p><font face="serif" size="2"><b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="serif" size="2"><b>American Business Financial Services, Inc. Reports<br>
Progress In Strategic Initiatives and Discusses Preliminary<br>
Quarterly and Year
      End Results</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">Philadelphia, PA&#8230;August 30,
2004&#8230; American Business Financial Services, Inc. (ABFS; NASDAQ: ABFI) today
announced that it achieved its best ever monthly and quarterly loan origination
results, producing $209 million of new loans in June 2004 and more than $509
million during the quarter ended June 30, 2004. ABFS said that during the year
ended June 30, 2004, it also completed the sale of $808.4 million of mortgage
loans with servicing released to various buyers, representing some of the most
highly regarded firms in the industry. In addition, subsequent to June 30, 2004,
ABFS has completed the sale of an additional $389.5 million of mortgage loans
with servicing released.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">ABFS also announced that the anticipated
    quarterly loss for June 30, 2004 will be less than the $33.2 million loss
    incurred for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. The loss for the quarter ended
    June 30, 2004 is expected to be in the range of $26 million to $30 million.  &#8220;Although
    we fully anticipated this loss, we believe our quarterly losses are now trending
    downward, and we believe this trend will continue during fiscal 2005, eventually
    returning the Company to profitable operations,&#8221; said Albert W. Mandia,
    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.&#8221;  The loss for
    the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 is expected to be in the range of $110
    million to $114 million.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">Depending on the Company&#8217;s
    ability to securitize in the future, it anticipates incurring losses at least
    through the first quarter of fiscal 2005, ending September 30, 2004. ABFS
    also anticipates that losses incurred in fiscal 2005 will be less than those
    incurred in fiscal 2004, assuming that the loan production increases experienced
    in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 continue into fiscal 2005. The Company
    also anticipates that it will need to originate $390 million to $490 million
    of loans per
month in order to return to profitable operations.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">&#8220;The loss for fiscal 2004 primarily
    resulted from liquidity issues that we have experienced since the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2003, including the absence of credit facilities until
    the second quarter of fiscal 2004. This substantially reduced our loan origination
    volume and our ability to generate revenues. We were also unable to complete
    a publicly underwritten securitization during fiscal 2004. In addition, as
    a result of the historically high industry-wide refinancing activity, we
    experienced non-cash valuation adjustments on our securitization assets,
    which were
    charged
    to our
    income
    statement,&#8221; according to Mandia.  &#8220;Adjustments in the Company&#8217;s
    business strategy resulted in operating expense levels that would support
    greater loan origination volume, which also contributed to the loss for fiscal
    2004.&#8221;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">Mandia continued, &#8220;Our loan origination and loan sale results demonstrate that ABFS is making real progress toward achieving the goals of our adjusted business model, which emphasizes greater loan origination volume and subsequent mortgage loan sales for cash. Over the last six months, we have established a national footprint with the acquisition or opening of four sales offices, as well as establishing relationships with other brokers across the country, which is significantly improving our ability to generate wholesale originations nationwide.&#8221;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">&#8220;Although the volume of our loan production is increasing significantly, we are proud that the quality of our loans remains at an extremely high level,&#8221; Mandia said.  &#8220;The execution of our whole loan sales is exceptional, demonstrated by the high percentage of loans purchased.  This has contributed to our improved cash flow position, as compared to June 30, 2003.  While we still face various challenges in implementing our business strategy, we believe we have made real progress to date.&#8221;</font></p>
