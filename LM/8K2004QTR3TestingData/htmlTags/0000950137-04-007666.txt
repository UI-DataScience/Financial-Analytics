                 SOURCE INTERLINK REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS

                             NET INCOME CLIMBS 38.3%

BONITA SPRINGS, FL, SEPTEMBER 9, 2004 - SOURCE INTERLINK COMPANIES (NASDAQ:
SORC), the largest direct-to-retail magazine distribution/fulfillment company
and leading provider of magazine information and front-end management services
for retailers, today announced results for the second quarter ended July 31,
2004.

Net income in the second quarter rose 38.3% to $4.1 million, or $0.17 per
diluted share, compared to $2.9 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the same
period last year. Revenue in the second quarter increased 7% to $91.4 million
from $85.5 million in the same period last year. The weighted average shares
outstanding for the three months ended July 31, 2003, were approximately
25,026,000 on a fully diluted basis compared to 19,679,000 for the same period
last year.

Leslie Flegel, Source Interlink Chairman and Chief Executive officer, said, "The
company's strong second quarter results reflect management's continued ability
to execute its strategic growth plan. Our ability to leverage our diverse
operations led to an increase in pretax profit of 45.4% to $6.1 million in the
second quarter compared to $4.2 million in the same period last year. Operating
profit margins improved to 6.7%. The results we have achieved, combined with a
strong balance sheet, have provided additional opportunities to grow the
business and expand our effective direct method for the distribution of
magazines within the multi-billion dollar industry. We will also continue to
develop new market opportunities outside of magazines through our unique
business model and seek strategic acquisitions and other ventures that add value
to our existing platform. In the second quarter, cash flow from operations
increased $8.2 million in the second quarter and the company reported $7.0
million in free cash flow."

Interlink, the company's direct-to-retail magazine distribution/fulfillment
division, reported revenue in the second quarter of $70.2 million compared to
$65.6 million in the same period a year ago, an increase of 7.1%. "The sales
increase of approximately $4.6 million in the second quarter was primarily due
to organic growth, which resulted in our ability to leverage our business and
increase profits appreciably. It is important to note these results do not
include business from recent acquisitions or penetration in the mainstream
market on a material basis. Our recently announced expansion in the mainstream
market, which now totals approximately 750 mainstream retail stores on a
national basis, will be complemented through two strategic acquisitions, Empire
News and PROMAG, which enhance our position in the mainstream market. Empire
currently provides service to an additional 1,000 mainstream retail stores
represented by major chains located along the east coast. Combined with our
existing business, this acquisition will enable Interlink to implement its more
efficient direct distribution model, compared to the


<PAGE>

traditional wholesale method, to a total of just under 2,000 mainstream retail
stores with the potential to penetrate approximately 30,000 additional stores
represented by the major national and regional chains served," Flegel said.

"During the quarter, we also strengthened our leading position in the specialty
market by signing an exclusive agreement with PRIMEDIA Inc. which will go into
effect in the fourth quarter. While the second quarter is historically a
generally slower selling period for magazines in bookstores, the division
remains on track to achieve a record second half, particularly in the fourth
quarter, and we expect Interlink to come in approximately on budget for the
year."

In-Store Services Division reported revenue of $13.5 million versus $15.9
million in the corresponding period a year ago. "In-Store Services continues to
be led by our profitable information management and rebate services businesses.
Result comparisons in the quarter were impacted negatively by the unusually high
volume of wire manufacturing business in last year's second quarter compared to
this year. Our recent acquisition of the west coast magazine rebate management
and information businesses from PROMAG provides strong growth and cross-selling
opportunities for our business, particularly wire manufacturing and
distribution, given a client base of 200 retailers, including Safeway,
Albertsons, Smith's Food & Drug, totaling more than 10,000 stores. This
transaction clearly solidifies our position as the number one front-end product
and service provider for retailers in North America. As we noted earlier, we
anticipate this acquisition to be slightly accretive to the current fiscal 2005
earnings and approximately five cents accretive to fiscal 2006 earnings based
solely on the rebate business acquired in the transaction," Flegel said.

Custom Wood Manufacturing reported revenue of $7.8 million versus $4.0 million
in the corresponding period a year ago, an increase of 93.1%. Flegel noted, "In
the second quarter, pretax income climbed to $1.2 million compared to $122,000
in the same quarter last year. The division continues to benefit from a
combination of new business agreements and consolidated operations.

Flegel concluded, "We are pleased with our second quarter results and expect a
strong performance in the second half of fiscal 2005. As a result of the
increase in shares outstanding via 800,000 additional shares sold by the company
due to increased demand in our March stock offering and excessive costs relating
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we expect earnings per share to be at
the low end of our previously stated guidance of $0.70 to $0.75 per diluted
share, exclusive of non-recurring charges. Revenue for the year is expected to
be approximately $370 million.

"The company has demonstrated its ability to grow organically while making
strategic acquisitions. We have gained from the compounding effect of increased
sales and reduced costs through the consolidation of our operations, which has
increased margins and substantially improved profits. This was evident in our
second quarter results as revenue increased 7% and pretax profits rose 45%. We
will continue to acquire companies and enter into strategic alliances that
bolster our existing client base and provide strong growth opportunities that
further enhance profits and produce greater returns for our shareholders. Our
efforts to strengthen our competitive position have enabled management to
successfully build the company, penetrate new markets and collectively increase
its position in each of the industries it serves."

Source Interlink will broadcast live via the Internet its second quarter
conference call for fiscal year 2005 today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss
financial results, business developments and future outlook. To listen to the
call, please go to www.fulldisclosure.com. A replay of the web cast will be
