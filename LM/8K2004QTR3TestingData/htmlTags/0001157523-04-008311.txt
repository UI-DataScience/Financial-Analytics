    approximately $7.5 million for the impact of favorable settlements
    associated with previous tax filings.

(3) In the first quarter of fiscal year 2003, the Company adopted the
    provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
    "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". Based upon the valuation
    results of its third party appraisal experts, the Company recorded
    a pretax charge of approximately $24 million in the first quarter
    of fiscal year 2003 as a result of implementing the fair value
    model of the new accounting standard.


    The Neiman Marcus Group, Inc. believes reporting adjusted earnings
is a more accurate representation of the Company's on-going economic
performance and therefore uses adjusted earnings internally to
evaluate and manage the Company's operations. The Neiman Marcus Group,
Inc. has chosen to provide this information to investors to enable
them to perform more meaningful comparisons of operating results and
as a means to emphasize the results of on-going operations. Adjusted
earnings should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for,
the Company's other measures of financial performance reported in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
