                   RPM REPORTS POSITIVE FIRST-QUARTER OUTLOOK
                      COMPANY CITES STRONG INTERNAL GROWTH

MEDINA, Ohio - September 27, 2004 - RPM International Inc. (NYSE: RPM) announced
today that sales for its fiscal 2005 first quarter, ended August 31, 2004, will
be approximately 13-14 percent higher than same-period sales a year ago.

"More than 80 percent of this sales increase represents internal growth," said
Frank C. Sullivan, president and CEO, "with both operating segments producing
double-digit gains. The momentum in our industrial businesses, which began
during the second half of fiscal 2004, continued through this first quarter. Our
consumer segment continues to generate solid results comparable to the levels we
have seen the past couple of years."

First-quarter earnings and earnings per share are expected to increase
13-15 percent over the previous year's first-quarter results.

The company further indicated that while pricing initiatives are being phased
in, higher material costs remain a challenge. In addition, RPM estimates that
its quarterly asbestos costs, the details of which will be set forth in the
company's report on Form 10-Q, will amount to approximately $19 million.
Overall, these quarterly costs and claims activity remain in line with the
company's expectations, and are consistent with the assumptions underlying its
reserve.

RPM's anticipated results will also reflect the early adoption of FAS 123
("Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation") and a reclassification of co-op
advertising expenses to be more in conformity with industry practice. The
adoption of FAS 123 is expected to impact first-quarter earnings by
approximately one-half cent per share. The reclassification will not impact
earnings results, but will reduce reported net sales and SG&A expenses by the
same amount, estimated to be 1-1.5 percent of sales for fiscal 2005. Prior
periods will also be reclassified for comparability purposes.

"We are very pleased with these initial results for our first quarter, which
fall well in line with our full-year fiscal 2005 guidance for high-single-digit
growth in revenue and 10-12 percent growth in earnings," Sullivan added. "We
will be presenting our complete first-quarter results the morning of October 6,
when we will be issuing our earnings release followed by our conference call."
