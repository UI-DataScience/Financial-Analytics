   KB HOME REPORTS RECORD THIRD QUARTER RESULTS; RAISES 2004 EARNINGS ESTIMATE
          REVENUES OF $1.75 BILLION, UP 21%; EPS INCREASES 22% TO $2.84
            NET ORDERS UP 23%; BACKLOG INCREASES 42% TO $4.82 BILLION
                  COMPANY FORECASTS EPS GROWTH OF 27% FOR 2005

Los Angeles, CA, September 20, 2004 - KB Home (NYSE: KBH), one of the largest
homebuilders in the United States and France, today announced record financial
results for its third quarter ended August 31, 2004. Highlights include:

   -  The Company achieved strong top-line growth in the third quarter of
      2004 with total revenues of $1.75 billion, up 21% from $1.44 billion
      posted in 2003. Housing revenues increased 24% to $1.72 billion in the
      quarter, driven by higher unit deliveries which rose 17% to 8,041 units
      and a 5% increase in the average selling price to $214,400.

   -  Substantial earnings growth in the quarter was driven by higher unit
      volume and the expansion of the Company's construction operating margin.
      Net income for the third quarter of 2004 totaled $117.9 million,
      increasing 20% from $97.8 million in the third quarter of 2003. The
      Company's diluted earnings per share increased to $2.84 for the three
      months ended August 31, 2004, up 22% from $2.33 for the three months ended
      August 31, 2003.

   -  Company-wide net orders for the third quarter increased 23% to 8,982,
      up from 7,319 net orders reported for the same quarter of 2003.
      Year-over-year net order growth was driven by higher net orders from each
      of the Company's geographic regions. Recent acquisitions and de novo
      growth have significantly expanded the Company's territory in the Central
      and Southeast regions and set the stage for continued net order momentum.

   -  Backlog at August 31, 2004, in terms of both units and dollars, was the
      highest of any quarter-end in the Company's history. The dollar value of
      backlog at August 31, 2004 totaled approximately $4.82 billion, up 42%
      from August 31, 2003, and represents a strong pipeline of future revenues
      for the remainder of 2004 and into 2005. The Company's unit backlog at
      August 31, 2004 stood at 21,928, an increase of 5,356 units or 32% from
      16,572 units at August 31, 2003.

   -  The Company's favorable financial performance through the first nine
      months of 2004 and positive outlook

                                       5
<PAGE>

      for the remainder of the year and 2005 have prompted an increase in
      expected earnings to $11.00 per diluted share for 2004 from the Company's
      previous estimate. This represents an increase of 25% from the $8.80
      earnings per diluted share generated in 2003. The Company also issued
      initial earnings guidance for 2005 of $14.00 per diluted share, a 27%
      increase over the forecasted 2004 diluted earnings per share.

            "The strength of KB Home's third quarter net income and earnings per
share is the direct result of our excellent top-line growth in unit deliveries
and revenues combined with the expansion of our margins," said Bruce Karatz,
chairman and chief executive officer. "The performance of our core homebuilding
business also benefited from our geographic diversity and growing wide-array of
attached and detached product offerings, appealing to first-time and move-up
homebuyers, as well as active adults and luxury buyers. As current market
conditions remained solid and supported the underlying fundamental demand for
housing, unit deliveries in nearly all of our geographic regions exceeded prior
year results in the third quarter. We anticipate this performance to continue in
the fourth quarter, delivering outstanding results for the full year."

            Total revenues for the third quarter of 2004 rose to $1.75 billion,
up 21% from $1.44 billion in the third quarter of 2003. Housing revenues
increased 24% in the period to $1.72 billion, up from $1.39 billion in the
year-earlier period as a result of increases in both unit volume and average
selling prices. Unit deliveries rose 17% to 8,041 in the third quarter of 2004
from 6,850 in the same quarter of 2003. The Company's overall average selling
price rose 5% to $214,400 in 2004 from $203,600 in 2003. Year-over-year growth
in the Company's average selling price reflected increases in all of its
domestic geographic regions.

            "Our strategic investments in markets across the country over the
past several quarters have laid the necessary groundwork for achieving our
long-term growth goals," Karatz said. "We fully expect these investments to
translate into higher community counts, revenues and earnings in the future.
Demand for new homes should remain healthy as we expect the nation's economy to
improve, consumer confidence to increase, household incomes to rise, and
favorable demographic trends to continue to drive new household formations.
Based on both our ability to deliver a rising number of new homes and our
assessment of likely market conditions for the remainder of this year and into
2005, we have increased our earnings estimate for 2004 to $11.00 per diluted
share and are forecasting a 27% increase in earnings to $14.00 per diluted share
for 2005."

            Construction operating income rose to $190.8 million in the third
quarter of 2004, a 39% increase from $137.3 million in the year-earlier quarter.
The improvement was largely due to higher unit volume and an expanded operating
margin. The Company's housing gross margin increased 130 basis points to 24.1%
for the three months ended August 31, 2004, up from 22.8% for the same period of
2003 primarily due to the favorable pricing environment as well as operating
efficiencies achieved. The Company's construction operating margin increased to
11.0% in the third quarter of 2004 from 9.7% in the third quarter of 2003. Net
income rose to an all-time third quarter high of $117.9 million in 2004, up 20%
from $97.8 million in the third quarter of 2003.

            "KB Home's operating margin exhibited substantial growth in the
third quarter primarily as a result of a higher housing gross margin," Karatz
said. "We have leveraged the increase in our revenues by managing our costs in
accordance with our operational business model to drive margin growth. Our
success in quickly and effectively integrating recently acquired businesses also
contributed to the improved profit margin."

            The Company's backlog value totaled approximately $4.82 billion at
August 31, 2004, a 42% increase compared to $3.40 billion at August 31, 2003.
Total backlog units at August 31, 2004 rose 32% year-over-year to

                                       6
<PAGE>

21,928 units reflecting increases in all geographic regions in which the Company
operates. This backlog growth resulted from a 23% increase in net orders for the
quarter ended August 31, 2004 to 8,982, up from the 7,319 net orders posted for
the same quarter of 2003. All geographic regions generated favorable
year-over-year comparisons.

            "Net order activity during the third quarter increased significantly
from the prior year quarter and drove the tremendous increase in our backlog
which represents future revenues," Karatz said. "With a record third quarter
backlog supporting our projections for the remainder of 2004, we operate from a
great vantage point as we move forward. Furthermore, as of quarter end we owned
or controlled a diverse inventory pipeline comprised of more than 160,000 lots
in attractive markets across the United States, which further enhances our
optimism for the longer-term in this land-constrained environment."

            During the first nine months of 2004, the Company delivered 21,361
homes, up 16% from the 18,457 delivered in the first nine months of 2003. Total
revenues for the first three quarters of 2004 reached $4.67 billion, up 17% from
$3.98 billion in the first three quarters of 2003. The Company's construction
operating margin improved 150 basis points to 10.3% for the nine months ended
August 31, 2004 and fueled a 27% increase in net income to $294.2 million from
$232.0 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2003. Diluted earnings per
share for the first three quarters of 2004 set a new Company record of $6.98,
advancing 27% from the prior record of $5.51 per share in the same period of
2003.
