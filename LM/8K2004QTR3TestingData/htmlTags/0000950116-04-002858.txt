            ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS
         o  NEWLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES PERFORM TO TARGETED LEVELS

         o  COMPANY REAFFIRMS REVENUE, PROFIT PROJECTIONS FOR RECORD FISCAL 2005

LATHAM, N.Y., SEPTEMBER 22, 2004--Intermagnetics General Corporation (NASDAQ:
IMGC), citing solid performance in "historic" operations and strong
contributions from recently acquired businesses, today announced that
first-quarter net income climbed to $5.7 million, or $0.21 per diluted share,
excluding acquisition-related expenses and the non-cash effects of the scheduled
vesting of performance-based stock compensation charges and recovery of certain
charges from a prior divestiture. Reported net income was $5.3 million, or $0.20
per diluted share. Net income for the prior-year quarter was $262,000, or $0.01
per diluted share. All per share amounts have been adjusted for the recent
3-for-2 stock split completed in August 2004.

Net sales for the quarter ended August 29, 2004, increased to $59.7 million,
compared with $22.3 million a year earlier. Sales and earnings for the
prior-year first quarter were affected by a planned reduction in deliveries of
magnet systems to accommodate a strategic enhancement to the company's exclusive
supply agreement with its major customer, an integrator of magnetic resonance
imaging systems.

"We are extremely pleased with our first-quarter performance--across the
board--in terms of the entire P&L, the balance sheet and the overall success of
our newly broadened base of businesses," said Glenn H. Epstein, chairman and
chief executive officer. "Our revenue is right on target for the conclusion of
the slower summer sales season even when taking into account the later than
anticipated closing of our acquisition of MRI Devices (MRID).

"Our newly acquired businesses--Invivo and MRID--have been performing well, as
have our historical businesses," Epstein said. "The Instrumentation segment was
especially strong, with a nearly 42 percent increase in sales and more than four
times the operating profit of a year earlier."

SMOOTH INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES

Epstein said that the integration of Invivo, a maker of MRI-related patient
monitoring systems and other devices acquired early in 2004, has been
essentially completed and that the integration of MRID is proceeding on plan.
Invivo contributed $18.6 million in

                                     -More-

revenue, an improvement of more than 15 percent from a year earlier. MRID, a
maker of specialized Radio Frequency (RF) coils and sub-systems for MRI
equipment, contributed about $5 million in revenue during its first six weeks as
part of Intermagnetics.

"We are highly confident that these integrations will continue to progress
smoothly and that both the key management and overall employee base will
contribute to the long-term growth of our company," Epstein said.

Epstein noted that this is the last quarter where stand-alone revenue figures
will be available for MRID due to its physical merger into one operating
division with the pre-existing RF coil business of Medical Advances, Inc. (MAI).
Expectations remain that combined revenues this fiscal year will still
demonstrate growth over the prior year despite some product rationalization
activities currently underway.

STRONG RESULTS FROM ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS

"The operating units we had in place prior to the acquisitions all turned in
strong performances during the first quarter," Epstein said. "Magnet Systems &
Components sales (exclusive of MRID) were consistent with seasonal expectations,
and the RF coil product lines continued to benefit from the efforts of the
Invivo sales team. The direct sales potential of MRID's RF coils are also
expected to benefit from the combined global sales effort in the coming quarter.
All businesses within the segment contributed to producing a $7.6 million
operating profit, compared with $297,000 in last year's first quarter.

"Invivo's $18.6 million in sales resulted in a $1.5 million operating profit for
the new Medical Devices segment," Epstein added. "The Instrumentation segment,
consisting of Polycold Systems, Inc., had an exceptional quarter, with sales
climbing 42 percent to $8.2 million and operating profit increasing to $2.5
million, from slightly less than $0.6 million last year. Polycold continues to
see increases in demand for vacuum-related products across a broad range of
non-semiconductor related customers in Europe, the U.S. and the Pacific Rim."

The Energy Technology segment achieved significant technical and prototype
device milestones on revenue of $1.5 million and an overall investment of $2.1
million, both of which were in line with anticipated levels of activity for this
emerging business area.

BALANCE SHEET REMAINS STRONG

The company reported a strong balance sheet with operating cash flow of nearly
$5.9 million during the quarter, resulting in a cash position of $10.8 million
at quarter-end net of $11.1 million of repayment of debt, $10 million of which
was in excess of scheduled requirements. Total long-term debt now stands at
$94.3 million. Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation (EBITDA) reached
$10.7 million. Epstein said the company's strengthening cash flow continues to
provide the flexibility to aggressively pay down debt while maintaining the
ability to invest in ongoing growth opportunities throughout the operating
businesses.

PERFORMANCE AGAINST GOALS

Epstein noted that Intermagnetics' first-quarter gross margin of 45 percent
substantially exceeded the company's recently enhanced target of 42 percent due
to favorable product mix and continued cost reduction efforts, with particular
contributions from accelerating efficiencies at Polycold. He commented that
while it remains premature to revise consolidated gross margin targets upward,
the overall financial model will be re-examined once MRID has been included in
results for a full quarter of operations. Operating income as a percent of sales
was 16 percent, which exceeded the ongoing target of 15 percent. Return on
assets, at 49 percent, was consistent with the long-term goal of 50 percent.
Return on equity was very strong--19 percent--versus the recently raised goal of
15 percent.

"Our overall efficiency in utilizing working capital was not to our historical
standard--21 percent versus our goal of requiring less than 15 percent of
sales--largely because of the effects of the acquired companies' current
inventories and accounts receivable," Epstein said. "These metrics are in the
process of being prioritized, and we expect to demonstrate improvement in the
coming quarters."

ACQUISITION-RELATED, NON-CASH ITEMS DETAILED

Among the items excluded in comparisons and operating EPS projections is about
$0.12 in non-cash performance-based stock compensation expense, expected to be
split evenly over the four quarters. Another $0.03 in final charges related to
the Invivo acquisition are expected to consist of about $0.01 in each of the
first three quarters, and $0.07 to $0.10 in MRID acquisition charges are
expected to be spread out through the year, with $0.01 in the first quarter,
$0.02 to $0.04 in the second quarter and the balance in the second half of the
year. Epstein noted that guidance has been adjusted for the recent stock split
yet remains consistent with earlier projections on an overall basis, but
adjusted slightly for estimated timing on the charges to be actually incurred.

Epstein also explained that a non-cash gain of $0.03 ($1.1 million) was
recognized in the first quarter as an adjustment to an environmental reserve
established with the divestiture of IGC-Advanced Superconductors (a business
focused on traditional, low- temperature superconductors) in 2001.

FORECAST FOR FISCAL YEAR REMAINS STRONG, Q2 OUTLOOK PROVIDED

"Based on the strength of our traditional and acquired businesses and the growth
we see ahead in our core market segments, we remain highly confident that we
will meet our earlier projections of revenue for fiscal 2005 of about $300
million and earnings per share on a normalized basis--excluding
acquisition-related and non-cash performance-based stock compensation and other
charges or benefits--to be in the $1.03 to $1.10 range," Epstein said. "While
our first-quarter SG&A (selling, general and administrative expense) was up in
total dollars, it was in line with our evolving operating model, and we believe
we are now well positioned to receive incrementally accelerating benefits from
revenue gains in the long term from a relatively fixed base of facilities,
engineering and manufacturing costs.

"Our current outlook for the `new Intermagnetics' second quarter is for record
revenue and profit, with growth in the range of 25 percent to what we just
achieved during the first quarter."
