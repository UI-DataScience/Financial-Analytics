     CENTENNIAL COMMUNICATIONS CORP. ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2004

HOLD FOR CALL

WALL, NEW JERSEY - SEPTEMBER 1, 2004 - Centennial Communications Corp.
(Nasdaq:CYCL) today announced results for the quarter and fiscal year ended May
31, 2004.

Consolidated revenues for fiscal year 2004 increased 11% from the prior year to
$828.8 million. Net loss was $22.8 million for fiscal year 2004, as compared to
a $111.6 million loss in the prior year. "Adjusted Operating Income" ("AOI") was
$330.5 million, an 11% increase from the prior year. AOI is net income (loss)
before minority interest in income of subsidiaries, income tax (expense)
benefit, other income (expense), loss on extinguishment of debt, interest
expense-net, income from equity investments, loss (gain) on disposition of
assets, loss on impairment of assets, depreciation and amortization, and other
non-cash charges. Please refer to Exhibit A -- "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."

During the fiscal fourth quarter ended May 31, 2004, the Company reported
consolidated revenues of $214.8 million. Net income for the fourth quarter was
$3.2 million, a decrease of $55.3 million from the same quarter last year. The
Company reported AOI of $88.8 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 8%
from the same quarter last year.

Other significant events reported during and after fiscal 2004 include:

     -  The Company launched its global system for mobile communications ("GSM")
        network in every cell site in its Midwest cluster ahead of schedule and
        within budget. The Company began receiving GSM roaming traffic in late
        November and has gradually introduced GSM service features and phones in
        all of its Midwest markets. Over 80% of the Company's gross subscriber
        additions in its

<PAGE>

        Midwest cluster are now subscribing to GSM services. The Company expects
        to launch GSM service in its Southeast cluster by the end of calendar
        year 2004.

     -  The Company's consolidated free cash flow (AOI minus capital
        expenditures) reached a record $198 million for fiscal 2004 up from $164
        million in fiscal 2003, with contributions from Caribbean Wireless and
        Caribbean Broadband now approaching that of U.S. Wireless. Caribbean
        Wireless and Caribbean Broadband AOI for Fiscal 2004 exceeded that of
        U.S. Wireless for the first time in the Company's history.

     -  The Company consummated a series of refinancing transactions aggregating
        $1.6 billion during fiscal 2004 that significantly improved the
        Company's balance sheet. The new financings extended the weighted
        average maturities of the Company's long-term debt and eliminated
        approximately $600 million in scheduled amortization payments over the
        next four years. In addition, these transactions resulted in greater
        financial and operating flexibility through a reduced number of
        financial covenants and simplified capital structure. The Company also
        significantly improved the liquidity of its common stock through a 10
        million share equity offering in November 2003.

     -  In August 2004, the Company announced that it had exercised its options
        to purchase 10 MHz of PCS spectrum from AT&T Wireless covering an
        aggregate of approximately 4.1 million population equivalents (POPs)
        contiguous to the Company's existing footprint in Michigan and Indiana.
        The aggregate exercise price of the spectrum is $19.5 million. At the
        same time, the Company also announced that it entered into a definitive
        agreement to sell to Verizon Wireless for $24 million in cash the
        Indianapolis and Lafayette, Indiana licenses that it expects to acquire
        from AT&T Wireless. If consummated, the net result of these transactions
        will be that the Company will obtain licenses covering approximately 2.2
        million incremental POPS, and receive $4.5 million of cash. Both
        transactions are subject to customary closing conditions, including
        regulatory approvals and are expected to close before calendar year-end
        2004.

     -  In May 2004, the Company announced its intention to seek strategic
        options for its Puerto Rico cable operations. The Company is currently
        in advanced negotiations regarding a potential sale of the cable
        operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will consummate
        any transaction with respect to its cable operations.

"I am delighted by the strength of our operating results for the quarter and
fiscal year ended May 31, 2004. The results demonstrate the power of the
Centennial brand and the positive customer experience it has come to signify.
Centennial's focus on providing an outstanding customer experience is clearly
paying dividends and bodes well for our prospects in fiscal 2005 and beyond",
said Michael J. Small, Chief Executive Officer.

<PAGE>

The Company's wireless subscribers at May 31, 2004 were 1,051,200, an increase
of 12% over fiscal 2003. In the fourth quarter, Caribbean Wireless subscribers
increased 21,600 as compared to the prior quarter, due to strong subscriber
growth in both Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. In the fourth quarter,
U.S. Wireless subscribers increased 2,900 from the prior quarter, aided by GSM
and national rate plans. Postpaid churn for the quarter was 1.8% in U.S.
Wireless and 2.4% in Caribbean Wireless. During fiscal year 2004, Caribbean
Wireless subscribers increased by 97,600 as compared to 62,300 in fiscal 2003
and in U.S. Wireless by 16,500 as compared to no subscriber growth in fiscal
2003. Caribbean Broadband switched access lines reached 50,210 and dedicated
access line equivalents were 213,920 at May 31, 2004, up 24% and 18%,
respectively from May 31, 2003. Cable TV subscribers were 73,400 at May 31,
2004, down 4,800 from the prior year.

For the year, total Caribbean revenues (consisting of the Caribbean Wireless and
Caribbean Broadband segments) were $458.6 million and AOI was $181.0 million.
AOI for the year was up 33% from the prior year. Caribbean Wireless revenues for
the year reached $306.2 million, an increase of 17% from the prior year.
Caribbean Wireless AOI for the year was $121.6 million, an increase of 26% from
the prior year. Caribbean Broadband revenues for the year were $164.7 million
and AOI reached $59.4 million, up 16% and 51% respectively, from the prior year.

U.S. Wireless revenues were $370.2 million for the year ended May 31, 2004 and
AOI was $149.5 million. Revenue increased 4% from the prior year due to a 13%
increase in service revenue, partially offset by a 30% reduction in roaming
revenue. Roaming revenue was $54.3 million in fiscal 2004, or 7% of consolidated
revenue, as compared to $77.6 million or 10% of consolidated revenues in fiscal
2003. U.S. Wireless AOI decreased by 7% from the prior year due to the reduction
in roaming revenue, partially offset by an increase in service revenue and
improved margins on retail revenue. Service revenue per subscriber increased to
$45 from $40 in the prior year, primarily due to the introduction of national
rate plans.

Consolidated capital expenditures for the year ended May 31, 2004 were $132.9
million or 16% of revenue. Net debt at May 31, 2004 was $1,655.8 million as
compared to $1,691.6 million at May 31, 2003.

The Company projects AOI growth for fiscal 2005 of 5-10% as compared to $330.5
million in fiscal 2004. The Company projects capital expenditures of
approximately $160 million in fiscal 2005, which includes approximately $25
million associated with the build out of the Lansing and Grand Rapids, Michigan
licenses we expect to acquire from AT&T Wireless. A reconciliation of projected
AOI is not included as it is not possible to project certain components of such
reconciliation at this time.

In preparation for complying with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 relating to internal control over financial reporting that will be
effective for the Company for its fiscal year ending May 31, 2005, and recent
guidance surrounding such legislation, the Company has restated its financial
statements as of May 31, 2003 and for the years

<PAGE>

ended May 31, 2003 and 2002. Such restatements primarily relate to adjustments
that were identified in the ordinary course of prior audits of the Company's
financial statements, but not recorded at the time due to their immateriality.
All comparisons to the fiscal year ended May 31, 2003 made in this release give
effect to this restatement. Revised financial statements for the first through
third quarters of fiscal 2004 are included in the attached tables. Additional
information regarding the restatement is contained in the Company's Form 10-K
filed on August 31, 2004.

In addition to the financial results determined in accordance with Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), this press release contains non-GAAP
financial measures such as AOI and free cash flow. The non-GAAP financial
measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the
information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations from GAAP to these
non-GAAP financial measures are provided in Exhibit A to this press release.

Conference Call Information

As previously announced, the Company will host a conference call concerning the
results on September 1, 2004 at 8:30 a.m. (Eastern). The conference call will be
simultaneously webcast over the Internet through the Company's website
(www.centennialcom.com), click on "Investor Relations." The conference call will
also be available at www.streetevents.com. A replay of the conference call will
be available on both sites after the conclusion of the call through September
14, 2004.

Cautionary statement for purposes of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: Information in this release that
involves Centennial's expectations, beliefs, hopes, plans, projections,
estimates, intentions or strategies regarding the future are forward-looking
statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks,
assumptions and uncertainties that could cause the Company's actual results to
differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements. These
risks, assumptions and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our
substantial debt obligations; the availability and cost of additional capital to
fund our operations, including the need to refinance and/or amend existing

<PAGE>

indebtedness; restrictive covenants and consequences of default contained in our
financing arrangements, which place limitations on how we conduct business; the
competitive nature of the telecommunications industry in the areas in which we
operate, including, without limitation, the effect of existing and new
competitors, including competitors that may have a lower cost basis or greater
resources than we do, competitors that may offer less expensive products than we
do and competitors that may offer more technologically advanced products than we
do; market prices for the products and services we offer may continue to decline
in the future; general economic, business, political and social conditions in
the areas in which we operate, including the less developed Caribbean region,
including the effects of world events on tourism in the Caribbean; continued
overbuilding by personal communications service providers in our U.S. wireless
markets and the effects of increased competition in our markets, which may cause
a reduction in roaming revenues, increased subscriber cancellations, a continued
reduction of prices charged and lower average revenue per subscriber;
fluctuations in currency values; our dependence on roaming agreements for a
material portion of our U.S. wireless revenues and the continued price declines
in roaming rates and potential reduction of roaming minutes of use; our
dependence on roaming agreements for our ability to offer our wireless customers
nationwide rate plans at competitive prices; our ability to attract and retain
qualified personnel; the fact that our coverage areas are not as extensive as
those of other wireless operators which may limit our ability to attract and
retain customers; the effects of consolidation in the wireless communications
industry; the effects of governmental regulation of the telecommunications
industry; the capital intensity of the telecommunications industry, including
our plans to make significant capital expenditures during the coming years to
continue to build out and upgrade our networks and the availability of
additional capital to fund these capital expenditures; declining rates for
international long distance traffic; opportunities for growth through
acquisitions and investments and our ability to manage this growth; changes and
developments in technology, including our ability to upgrade our networks to
remain competitive and our ability to anticipate and react to frequent and
significant technological changes; our ability to effectively manage subscriber
cancellations, particularly in light of regulations that took effect November
2004 requiring wireless companies to permit the phone numbers that they allocate
to their customers to be portable when the customer switches to another carrier,
which may increase customer churn and present technological difficulties; local
operating hazards and risks in the areas in which we operate, including without
limitation, hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms and other natural disasters; our
ability to manage, implement and monitor billing and operational support
systems; potential litigation relating to using wireless telephones while
operating an automobile and the potential reduction of wireless usage due to
legislation restricting usage while driving; potential litigation relating to
possible health effects of radio frequency transmission; the relative
illiquidity and corresponding volatility of our common stock and our ability to
raise equity capital; the control of us retained by certain of our stockholders
and anti-takeover provisions; and other risks referenced from time to time in
the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All
forward-looking statements included in this release are based upon information
available to Centennial as of the date of this release, and the Company assumes
no obligation to update or revise any such forward-looking statements.

EXHIBIT A -- NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

      Regulation G, "Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures," and
other provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, define and
prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information.
Throughout this press release, we present certain financial measures that are
not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, including "adjusted
operating income." We previously referred to this non-GAAP financial measure in
our filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"),
press releases and other communications with investors as "adjusted EBITDA." The
change to "adjusted operating income" is a change in name only and we have not
changed the way we calculate current or prior results with respect to this
financial measure.

      We view adjusted operating income as an operating performance measure, and
as such we believe that the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to
it is net income or net loss. In calculating adjusted operating income, we
exclude from net income or net loss the financial items that we believe have
less significance to the day-to-day operation of our business. We have outlined
below the type and scope of these exclusions and the limitations on the use of
this non-GAAP financial measure as a result of these exclusions. Adjusted
operating income is not an alternative to net income, operating income or cash
flows from operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with
GAAP. Investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on
adjusted operating income as a substitute for any GAAP financial measure. In
addition, our calculation of adjusted operating income may or may not be
consistent with that of other companies. We strongly urge investors and
potential investors in our securities to review the reconciliation of adjusted
operating income to the comparable GAAP financial measures that are included in
this press release and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate
our business.

      Adjusted operating income is used by our management as a supplemental
financial measure to evaluate the performance of our business that, when viewed
with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, we believe provides
a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than
the GAAP results alone. Management also uses this financial measure as one of
several criteria to determine the achievement of performance-based cash bonuses.
We also regularly communicate our adjusted operating income to the public
through our earnings releases because it is the financial measure commonly used
by analysts that cover our industry and our investor base to evaluate our
performance. We understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on
non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted operating income, to provide a
financial measure by which to compare a company's assessment of its operating
performance against that of other companies in the same industry. This non-GAAP
financial measure is helpful in more clearly reflecting the sales of our
products and services, as well as highlighting trends in our core businesses
that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial
measures, because this non-GAAP financial measure eliminates from earnings
financial items that have less bearing on our performance. In addition, as our
calculation of adjusted operating income is similar, but not identical, to
certain financial ratios that are used in the financial covenants of our New
Senior Secured Credit Facility and the indentures governing our Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2008, Senior Notes due 2013 and Senior Notes due 2014,
and since we do not publicly disclose the calculations of these financial
ratios, adjusted operating income is the most comparable financial measure that
is readily available to investors to evaluate our compliance with our financial
covenants.

      The term "adjusted operating income" as used in this press release refers
to, for any period, net income (loss) before minority interest in income of
subsidiaries, income tax (expense) benefit , other income (expense), loss on
extinguishment of debt, interest expense-net, income from equity investments,
loss (gain) on disposition of assets, loss on impairment of assets, depreciation
and amortization, and other non-cash charges.

      Set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been
excluded from our net income (loss) to calculate adjusted operating income and
the material limitations associated with using this non-GAAP financial measure
as compared to the use of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:

      -  Minority interest in income or loss of subsidiaries relates to our
         minority investors' proportionate share of income in our non-wholly
         owned subsidiaries, which generated non-cash charges to our operating
         results. Operating results attributable to these minority investors'
         investments do not necessarily result in any direct, immediate benefit
         or detriment to us and, therefore, we believe it would be helpful for
         an investor to exclude such items to better reflect our core operating
         performance.

      -  Management does not consider income tax benefit or expense when
         considering the profitability of our core operations. Nevertheless, the
         amount of taxes we are required to pay reduces the amount of funds
         otherwise available for use in our business and thus may be useful for
         an investor to consider.

      -  Other income or expense relates to foreign currency translation losses
         in our operations in the Dominican Republic because some of our revenue
         in the Dominican Republic is collected and expenses are paid in local
         currency, the DR peso. Although

<PAGE>

         foreign currency translation gains or losses have a cash effect on our
         results, because some of our costs incurred in the Dominican Republic
         are paid in U.S. dollars, by excluding them we are better able to
         evaluate the real effects of changes in our core operating performance.

      -  Loss on extinguishment of debt relates to our refinancing transactions
         in fiscal 2004. As such, we do not believe these costs are relevant to
         an understanding of our core operating results.

      -  The amount of interest expense we incur is significant and reduces the
         amount of funds otherwise available to use in our business and,
         therefore, is important for investors to consider. However, management
         does not consider the amount of interest expense when evaluating our
         core operating performance.

      -  Income from equity investments relates to our proportionate share of
         income or loss from the entities in which we hold minority interests.
         We do not control these entities and, as such, do not believe the
         income we receive from such entities is indicative of our core
         operating performance.

      -  The fiscal 2004 other non-cash charges relates to the write-off of a
         promissory note received in connection with the sale of our Jamaican
         Internet Service provider that occurred in fiscal 2003. While this
         charge reduces cash available to us, management does not consider this
         write-off amount when evaluating core operating performance. Further,
         the gain on the sale of our Jamaican Internet Service provider, was
         excluded from AOI at the time of the sale.

      -  The fiscal 2003 other non-cash charges relate to disputed billings that
         arose in prior fiscal years with the Puerto Rico Telephone Company
         ("PRTC"). We recorded this charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2003
         as a result of developments in these disputes at that time and the
         protracted negotiations with the PRTC concerning the disputed billings.
         While these charges reduced cash available to us, due to newly
         negotiated interconnection rates with the PRTC, we believe disputed
         charges will become less material in future periods.

      -  Loss or gain on the disposition of assets may increase or decrease the
         cash available to us and thus may be important for an investor to
         consider. We are not in the business of acquiring or disposing of
         assets and, therefore, the effect of the disposition of assets may not
         be comparable from year-to-year. We believe such gains or losses
         recorded on the disposition of an asset do not reflect the core
         operating performance of our business

      -  Loss on impairment of assets is a non-cash charge incurred as a result
         of changes in the valuations of our assets. Although it is important to
         recognize that some of our assets have decreased in value, we do not
         believe it is indicative of our core operating performance.

      -  Depreciation and amortization are important for investors to consider,
         even though they are non-cash charges, because they represent generally
         the wear and tear on our property, plant and equipment, which produce
         our revenue. We do not believe these charges are indicative of our core
         operating performance.

      Management compensates for the above-described limitations of using a
non-GAAP financial measure by using this non-GAAP financial measure only to
supplement our GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the
factors and trends affecting our business.

      The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted
operating income for our consolidated results.

      Our business segments were determined in accordance with GAAP. Our
management measures the operating performance of each of our business segments
based on adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income is the measure of
profit or loss reviewed by the chief operating decision maker when assessing the
performance of each segment and making decisions about the resources to allocate
to each segment. Under current SEC rules for non-GAAP financial measures,
adjusted operating income as used with respect to our business segments is not
required to be reconciled to a GAAP financial measure. We have, however, also
provided in the following tables a reconciliation of operating income to
adjusted operating income for each of our business segments.

      Set forth below are descriptions of the financial terms that have been
excluded from each segment's operating income to calculate adjusted operating
income.

      -     Management fees relates to expense allocations from the Company's
            corporate headquarters to the operating segments. Management does
            not consider the amount of management fees when evaluating the
            Company's core operating performance.

      -     Other non-cash charges - See explanation above.

      -     Loss or gain on disposition of assets - See explanation above.

      -     Loss on impairment of assets - See explanation above.

RECONCILIATION OF CONSOLIDATED NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO FREE
CASH FLOW

The Company views free cash flow as a liquidity measure and, as such, believes
that the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow is
net cash provided by operating activities. The Company has presented free cash
flow because this financial measure, in combination with other financial
measures, is an integral part of its internal reporting system. Free cash flow
provides an important measurement of the cash generated by our operations after
capital reinvestment in our business and is an indicator of our ability to
service our long-term debt and other corporate cash requirements. Free cash flow
should not be construed as an alternative to net income (loss), as determined in
accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating
activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe free cash flow is
useful to investors as a means to evaluate the cash-generating capabilities of
our operations, as recurring capital expenditures are required in the
communications industry to sustain our customer base and revenue growth.
Further, we consider trends in free cash flow when making decisions regarding
the allocation of financial resources.
