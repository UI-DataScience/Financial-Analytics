                 SHOLODGE ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2004 RESULTS


HENDERSONVILLE, Tenn. (August 25, 2004) - ShoLodge, Inc. (NASDAQ:LODG) today
announced results for its second quarter and 28-week period ended July 11, 2004.

         Total operating revenues for the second quarter of 2004 were $9.3
million compared with $8.3 million in the second quarter a year ago. The Company
reported losses from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2004 of
$1.3 million, or $0.25 per share, compared with losses of $1.4 million, or $0.28
per share, in the second quarter of 2003. Net losses after discontinued
operations were $319,000, or $0.06 per share, in the second quarter of 2004,
compared with net losses of $807,000, or $0.16 per share, in the same period
last year.

         For the second quarter of 2004, total revenues from hotel operations
were $1.2 million compared with $1.0 million in the second quarter of 2003.
Revenue per available room (RevPAR) for the three hotels included in continuing
operations was $40.07 in the second quarter of 2004 compared with $33.61 in the
second quarter of last year. The three hotels include two AmeriSuites hotels and
one GuestHouse Inn.

         The Company transferred five hotels in the fourth quarter of 2002,
eight hotels were sold in 2002 and 2003, one hotel was sold in the second
quarter of 2004, and two hotels were held for sale as of the end of the second
quarter of this year. These two hotels were subsequently sold in the third
quarter of this year. The effects of these sixteen hotels are reflected in
discontinued operations.

         Total operating revenues for the 28 weeks ended July 11, 2004 were
$20.7 million compared with $14.5 million in the same period of 2003. The
Company reported losses from continuing operations of $2.6 million, or $0.51 per
share, compared with earnings of $597,000, or $0.12 per share, in the prior-year
period. Net losses after discontinued operations were $1.4 million, or $0.28 per
share, in the first two quarters of 2004, compared with net losses of $348,000,
or $0.07 per share, in the first two quarters of 2003.

         For the first two quarters of 2004, total revenues from hotel
operations were $2.6 million compared with $1.8 million in the first two
quarters of 2003. Revenue per available room (RevPAR) for the three hotels
included in continuing operations was $36.36 in the first two quarters of 2004
compared with $31.20 in the first two quarters of last year.

         The first two quarters of 2003 included $5.3 million in lease
abandonment income, $597,000 of gains on the sale of properties, and $816,000 of
gains from the early extinguishments of debt. Of these items, the first two
quarters of 2004 included only $148,000 of gains on the sale of properties.

         "Since the acquisition of the exclusive franchising rights for the
GuestHouse Inns & Suites hotel brand just over two years ago, we have been
converting both Company-owned




<PAGE>

and franchised Shoney's Inns & Suites to the GuestHouse identity," said Leon
Moore, chief executive officer of ShoLodge. "We now have more hotels operating
under one nationally-recognized name that cater to both business and leisure
travelers."

         During the second quarter of 2004, the Company converted its 31st
Shoney's Inn to the GuestHouse brand. Three former independent hotels were also
converted to the GuestHouse brand in the most recent quarter. The conversions
brought the total number of GuestHouse locations nationally to 72.

         Moore said that ShoLodge also continued to increase the number of
hotels and resort properties served by InnLink, the Company's proprietary
reservation center. As of the end of the second quarter of 2004, InnLink served
a total of 961 lodging facilities as compared with 819 lodging facilities a year
earlier. Moore added that in addition to the Company's increased franchising
efforts and continued expansion of our reservation services, it intends to
continue to utilize its construction and development expertise as opportunities
arise.
