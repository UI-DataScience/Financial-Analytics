Versata Reports Third Quarter Financial Results; Company Reports
Fourth Consecutive Quarter of Revenue Growth

    OAKLAND, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 2, 2004--Versata, Inc.
(Nasdaq:VATA), a provider of software and services that automate the
development and ongoing management of data-intensive applications,
today reported its financial results for the fiscal third quarter,
ended July 31, 2004.
    Total revenue was $4.1 million, reflecting a 9 percent increase
over the prior quarter and a 49 percent increase over the same quarter
last year. Software license revenue was $1.5 million, reflecting a 20
percent increase over the prior quarter and a 218 percent increase
over the same quarter last year. Gross margin also continued to
improve, rising to 68 percent, up from 67 percent in the prior
quarter, and 60 percent a year ago.
    On the bottom line, Versata's $1.1 million, or $0.13 per share,
GAAP net loss was slightly higher than its second quarter net loss of
$880,000, or $0.11 per share, and less than one-third of the $3.8
million, or $0.51 per share, loss in the prior year period.
Contributing in part to the quarter's GAAP net loss were approximately
$645,000 in restructuring and other costs primarily related to
Versata's write-down of certain leasehold improvements associated with
the headquarters' lease restructure completed last quarter. The
non-GAAP net loss for the third quarter, which excludes these charges,
was $316,000, or $0.04 per share, substantially better than the
$879,000, or $0.11 per share, net loss during the second quarter and
the $1.4 million, or $0.19 per share, net loss in the prior year
period.
    Versata reduced its cash burn by 42 percent, to $452,000 this
quarter from $784,000 last quarter. Versata ended the third quarter
with $10.3 million in cash and short-term investments.
    "We made a lot of progress on several fronts during the third
quarter and I'm personally very proud of our team's achievements,"
said Alan Baratz, CEO and president of Versata. "Although much work
remains, I believe our emphasis on operational, product and service
excellence will continue to serve us well."

    Customers

    During the quarter, Versata sold new products and services to
several of its existing customers, including Equifax, GAD, IBM and the
State of Utah.
    Also aiding sales were key customers who deployed new applications
that they have been developing on the Versata platform. Among this
group is Equifax. An information services provider, Equifax in the
third quarter deployed to one client an application that automates the
process of extending credit and processing loans. This required
Equifax to purchase new Versata run-time licenses. As more Equifax
customers choose to use the new application, we expect that Equifax
will purchase additional Versata licenses.

    Products

    Versata made two key enhancements to its products during the third
quarter. First, the company shipped the Versata Logic Suite for the
open source JBoss application server. Second, Versata certified its
software for the WebSphere platform for the IBM eServer iSeries
servers.
    Versata also recently enhanced its engineering capacity with the
addition of a team of seven talented developers, most of who are based
in Nova Scotia, Canada. Their depth of experience as a group includes
several decades of enterprise software development, including senior
roles in the creation of the BEA WebLogic Integration product.
    Finally, with its newly expanded engineering team, the company has
been able to begin work on Versata Logic Suite 6.0, its next major
software release. Versata Logic Suite 6.0 is being designed to provide
developers with several key enhancements, including improved workflow,
access to tools based on the open source Eclipse project, business
activity monitoring using executive dashboards, and new features for
business process management.

    Quarterly Conference Call

    Versata will host its quarterly conference call, open to all
interested parties, at 2:00 p.m. (PDT), 5:00 p.m. (EDT), today. The
call will be available over the Internet at www.versata.com.

    Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Regulation G)

    Versata uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures to report
its financial results. Management believes that these non-GAAP
financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to
evaluate on-going operating results and trends excluding certain
items. Versata has historically included non-GAAP financial measures
when reporting to the investment community and therefore believes the
inclusion of certain non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency
and comparability with past financial reports. However, non-GAAP
financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a
substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with
GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used within our earnings press
release exclude expenses for: stock-based compensation, amortization
of intangibles and restructuring and other. Investors are encouraged
to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to
their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as provided in
the financial tables attached.
