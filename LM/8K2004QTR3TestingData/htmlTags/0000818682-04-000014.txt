FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - page 1 of 2

          Harold's Stores, Inc. Releases Improved Operating Results For
                  The Second Quarter Ended July 31, 2004
                  Net losses narrowed during the quarter

Dallas,  TX  -  August 24, 2004 - Harold's Stores, Inc. (AMEX symbol:  HLD)
(the  "Company"),  a chain of upscale ladies' and men's  specialty  apparel
stores,  announced today improved operating results for the second  quarter
and year-to-date period ended July 31, 2004.

For the second quarter, the Company reported a net loss of $1.2 million, or
$0.23  per  share,  compared to a net loss of $2.2 million,  or  $0.42  per
share,  in  the same period of the previous year.  The prior  year  results
included $462,000 of restructuring expenses associated with store closings.
During  the  year-to-date period ending July 31, 2004,  the  net  loss  was
$451,000, or $0.19 per share, as compared to a net loss of $4.3 million, or
$0.83  per  share, in the same period of the prior year.   The  prior  year
results included $1.6 million of costs associated with store closings.

"During  the  second quarter and first half of this year, we  saw  a  solid
improvement  in  our reported operating results, including gross  margins,"
said  Hugh Mullins, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Reported gross
margins  were approximately 35% for the first half of 2004 as  compared  to
about  29%  during  the same time last year.  This increase  resulted  from
greater  selling  at full price due to the combination of our  having  more
desirable merchandise and our strategy of taking a less promotional  stance
and conducting more timely clearances.  While the second quarter produced a
loss, it was greatly reduced from last year's level, despite the fact  that
the  Company's  new clearance strategy accelerated more spring  and  summer
merchandise markdowns into the second quarter."

Mr.  Mullins  continued,  "Sales  on  our  spring  and  summer  merchandise
collections exceeded our expectations during the first quarter,  ultimately
causing  June's inventory levels and sales to be less than plan.   We  were
able  to  deliver our early fall merchandise deliveries more  heavily  into
July  than  last year, allowing us to achieve our needed inventory  levels.
Thus  far  into  the fall season, we have been pleased with our  customers'
initial  reactions to the merchandise.  Our current inventory, even  though
slightly below last year's levels, consists of a far greater percentage  of
new fall merchandise and a significantly lower level of clearance inventory
than last year."

For  the  second  quarter,  the  Company's  total  comparable  store  sales
increased  2.3%.   Comparable store sales in the full-price  retail  stores
increased  2.4%,  on  top  of the 12.0% comparable  stores  sales  increase
experienced  in  the  second  quarter  of  the  prior  year.  Outlet  store
comparable  sales  decreased 0.7%.  Net sales for the  quarter  were  $19.3
million,  compared  to $19.6 million for the same period  in  the  previous
year,  a decrease of 1.4%. Total sales were nearly the same level as  those
of  last year, despite the closing of unprofitable stores during the  prior
period.

The  Company's total comparable store sales increased 5.7% during the first
half,  increasing  5.7% in the full-price retail stores  and  5.3%  in  the
outlets.   Net  sales in the first half were $43.5 million as  compared  to
$44.3  million during the prior year, a decrease of 1.8%.   Net sales  were
essentially equal to last year's, despite the closing of eight unprofitable
stores during the first six months of the prior year.

Founded in 1948 and headquartered in Dallas, Texas, Harold's Stores, Inc.,
currently operates 41 upscale ladies' and men's specialty stores in 19
states. The Company's Houston locations are known as "Harold Powell."
