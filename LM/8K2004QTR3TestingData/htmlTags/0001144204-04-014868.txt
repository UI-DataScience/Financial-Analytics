Exhibit 99.1
                   Nutrition 21 Reports Fiscal Fourth-Quarter
                           And Full-Year 2004 Results

         Company Expects Continued NASDAQ SmallCap Listing Through 2005

      PURCHASE, N.Y., September 21, 2004 - Nutrition 21, Inc. (NASDAQ: NXXI),
the leading developer and marketer of chromium-based nutritional supplements,
today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended
June 30, 2004.

      Revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.8 million, compared to $1.8
million for the comparable period a year ago. Net loss for the fourth quarter
was $2.6 million or $(0.07) loss per diluted share, compared to a net loss for
the fourth quarter of last fiscal year of $7.0 million or ($0.22) loss per
diluted share. The fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003 included an impairment
charge of $4.4 million. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004, Nutrition 21
reported total revenues of $10.2 million, compared to $10.6 million for the same
period a year ago. Net loss for fiscal year 2004 was $5.9 million or $(0.16)
loss per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $10.5 million or ($0.32) loss
per diluted share for the prior year. The Company closed the year with over $4
million in cash.

      Gail Montgomery, President and CEO of the Company commented, "While total
revenues were slightly less than the prior year, we are pleased to report a $1.6
million increase in gross profit in fiscal year 2004 with gross margins
approaching 80%. This improvement is directly related to our fiscal year 2003
decision to discontinue our investment in the Lite Bites(R) product line and
focus our sales and business development efforts on our chromium technologies.
Chromax(R) chromium picolinate, our flagship ingredient, which is licensed for
use in nearly 85% of all US chromium mineral supplement products, accounted for
more than 85% of our product sales in fiscal year 2004.

      "We intend to continue strengthening our ingredients business, which
remains a strong contributor to cash flow. According to the Nutrition Business
Journal, chromium enjoyed 26% growth in calendar year 2003, an annual growth
rate that exceeds all other minerals in the vitamin and supplement category. As
our clinical research and communications programs unfold to emphasize the
essential role of chromium in maintaining healthy insulin function in people
with or at risk for diabetes and heart disease, we expect to further stimulate
that growth.

      "Establishing the therapeutic role of our chromium-based products in
reducing the risk and symptoms associated with diabetes is a key element of our
strategy. Researchers at Harvard University and Johns Hopkins University have
recently shown correlations between low chromium status and the signs and
symptoms of type 2 diabetes. The National Institutes of Health is now funding an
independent research program to determine the public health implications
associated with chromium nutrition. If government research validates chromium's
pivotal role in human metabolism, the chromium market may one day rival that of
calcium, which is estimated at more than $1 billion in retail supplement sales.

      "The filing of our FDA health claim petition to obtain diabetes and
insulin resistance prevention claims for chromium picolinate was a key fiscal
2004 milestone. We anticipate that we will receive guidance from the FDA on the
petition before the end of this calendar year. In the months ahead we will also
be reporting on the exciting results of our ongoing chromium research program.
We expect that data generated by studies completed in fiscal year 2004 will 1)
further confirm the safety of chromium picolinate; 2) present a new method of
measuring chromium status in humans; 3) provide new insights into chromium
picolinate's mechanism of action that further confirms its role as an insulin
sensitizer; and 4) provide clinical evidence of chromium's ability to be to an
effective treatment of type 2 diabetes. As the peer-reviewed study results are
published, we plan to aggressively publicize these findings to increase the
demand for chromium picolinate use in vitamin and supplement formulas.
Additionally, once the safety and efficacy of Chromax chromium picolinate are
well established, we will actively market to functional food and beverage
manufacturers. This will be a new market for the Company's ingredient products.

<PAGE>

      "We are also pleased to report that our Diachrome(R) research program is
on track for completion in November. In August 2004, the final patient was
enrolled in a definitive study being conducted by XLHealth, a disease management
company. In fiscal year 2005, we look forward with confidence to reporting on
this large-scale study designed to pharmaceutical standards. We were pleased to
report on the results of two clinical trials in fiscal year 2004. Data obtained
in these trials showed that Diachrome, when used as an adjunct to traditional
oral anti-diabetic agents in people with type 2 diabetes, can significantly
improve blood sugar and lipid control. The study outcomes compared favorably to
those seen with prescription medications. Assuming positive Diachrome study
outcomes in the large-scale trial, the Company hopes to have XLHealth
incorporate Diachrome into its treatment protocol. This will be a key step in
the Company's longer term program to secure government and health care approval
of Diachrome as a reimbursed first line medical nutrition therapy for all US
patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes."

      Montgomery closed, "We are proud of our fiscal year 2004 accomplishments
and believe the Company is on track to deliver on its promise of investing in
gold standard clinical research to reposition Chromax chromium picolinate as the
premium chromium ingredient in the newly reinvigorated chromium market. We have
built strong alliances with key researchers at leading academic diabetes and
obesity centers, including, Harvard, Yale, University of Pennsylvania,
Pennington Biomedical Research Center and Duke University. Importantly, this
investment in research has also created a scientific foundation that is paving
the way for the launch of Diachrome as a finished consumer product that will
initially be marketed through healthcare professionals.

      "The most significant research spending is now behind us. Our proprietary
chromium technology platform is well positioned to capitalize on the burgeoning
diabetes and pre-diabetes markets, and the Company is poised to fully
commercialize its potential. Our organization has been strengthened by several
key hires and a more streamlined focus. We are in a good cash position and will
maintain our NASDAQ listing at least through 2005 if we either satisfy the
minimum $1 bid price and other initial listing criteria, or continue to meet
non-stock price initial listing criteria and commit that we will reverse split
our stock by early January 2006. In summary, fiscal year 2005 promises to be a
real turning point for the Company."
