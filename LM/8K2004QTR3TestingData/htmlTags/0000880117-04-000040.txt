FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
THURSDAY, AUGUST 19, 2004


   JOHN B. SANFILIPPO ANNOUNCES RECORD NET SALES AND NET INCOME FOR
                                FISCAL 2004

Fiscal 2004 Net Income Increases 51% over the Prior Year's Record Net Income

           Fiscal 2004 Net Sales Increase 24% over the Prior Year


Elk Grove Village, IL, August 19, 2004 -- John B. Sanfilippo & Son, Inc.
(Nasdaq: JBSS) today announced operating results for its fiscal 2004
fourth quarter and year ended June 24, 2004.  Net income for the current
fourth quarter was approximately $3.5 million and was relatively
unchanged when compared to net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal
2003. Diluted earnings per share for the current quarter decreased to
$.33 from $.37 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The decrease in
diluted earnings per share was attributable to an increase in share
count from the Company's public offering of 1.15 million common shares,
which was completed at the beginning of the current quarter.  The
current quarter earnings included prepayment penalties of approximately
$1.0 million resulting from the early extinguishment of long-term debt.
Additionally, after reviewing estimates of unpaid claims provided to the
Company by its workers' compensation insurance carrier during the fourth
quarter, the Company increased its workers' compensation insurance
reserve. The prepayment penalties and the increase in the workers'
compensation reserve combined to reduce the diluted quarterly earnings
per share by approximately $0.11.   Fiscal 2004 net income increased by
approximately 51% to approximately $22.6 million, or $2.32 per share
diluted, from approximately $15.0 million, or $1.61 per share diluted,
for fiscal 2003.  The prepayment penalties and the increase in the
workers' compensation reserve combined to reduce the diluted year end
earnings per share by approximately $0.12.

Net sales for the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter increased by approximately
25% to approximately $124.5 million from approximately $99.3 million in
the fiscal 2003 fourth quarter.   Net sales for fiscal 2004 increased by
more than $101 million to approximately $520.8 million from net sales of
approximately $419.7 for fiscal 2003.  The addition of new customers,
increased sales at existing customers and higher selling prices
effectuated the increase in net sales in both the fourth quarter
and the fiscal year. Net sales for both the current quarter and the
current fiscal year increased significantly in all of the Company's
distribution channels and across all nut types.  Unit volume, as
measured in pounds sold, increased by 7% for the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004 versus the prior year's fourth quarter and by 13% for fiscal
2004 versus the prior fiscal year.

Gross profit margin declined from 17.2% of net sales for the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003 to 15.3% of net sales for the current quarter due
to significantly higher commodity costs in all of the nuts that the
Company processes and the increase in the workers' compensation reserve
discussed above. As a percentage of net sales, the 1.9% decline in the
fourth quarter comparison of gross margins was substantially lower than
the 3.5%  decline in the third quarter comparison of gross margins due
to selling price increases that became effective in the current fourth
quarter.   The gross profit margin for fiscal 2004 increased to 17.6% of
net sales from 17.4% of net sales for fiscal 2003.  As a percentage of
net sales, increases in gross margin realized in the first half of
fiscal 2004, which resulted from higher unit volume and lower peanut
costs, were mostly offset by declines in gross margin in the second half
of fiscal 2004 due to significantly higher commodity costs.

Selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, fell
to 9.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 from 10.3% in the fiscal
2003 fourth quarter.  For fiscal 2004, selling and administrative
expenses, as a percentage of net sales, fell to 9.8% from 10.5% in
fiscal 2003.  The decreases in total selling and administrative
expenses, as a percentage of net sales, for both the quarter and the
fiscal year were primarily the result of increased sales while certain
selling and administrative expenses remained relatively fixed.
Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 increased to
approximately $7.2 million from approximately $6.9 million for the
fourth quarter of the prior year.   Operating income for fiscal 2004
rose 42% to approximately $41.1 million from approximately $28.8 million
for fiscal 2003.

Interest expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was approximately
$0.6 million in comparison to approximately $1.2 million in the fourth
quarter of 2003.  For the entire fiscal year, interest expense declined
from $4.7 million to $3.4 million.  The decrease in interest expense
occurred because the Company used the proceeds generated from its public
equity offering, which was completed early in the current quarter, to
pay down most of its long-term and short-term debt.   Additionally, the
Company generated approximately $11.5 million of cash flow after capital
expenditures during the current fiscal year which was used to pay down
short-term debt.  Total debt at the end of fiscal 2004 declined to $19.2
million from $70.1 million in total debt at the end of fiscal 2003.

The Company is currently studying a succession plan for the retirement
of the Chief Executive Officer and President which may include
consulting arrangements and other post-employment compensation
arrangements.  It did not implement a retirement plan for those officers
in the fourth quarter.

"For the fifth consecutive year, the Company has reported record
earnings," stated Jasper B. Sanfilippo, Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer.  "This year's earnings performance was fueled by
remarkable increases in sales across all of the Company's distribution
channels and nut types.  Increasing consumer awareness of the health
benefits of eating nuts, the addition of new customers and higher
average selling prices led to this impressive growth," Mr. Sanfilippo
emphasized.  "Nut markets have risen dramatically in recent months, and
we expect them to continue to rise in the near future as world-wide nut
consumption continues to increase.  These increases in the costs of our
raw materials have had a negative impact on our gross margins in the latter
half of fiscal 2004," Mr. Sanfilippo explained.  We have successfully
implemented price increases in the spring and also earlier this month in
all distribution channels except our industrial channel where sales are
typically made pursuant to twelve-month fixed-price contracts.  Those
contracts will expire throughout the fall of this calendar year.  The
combination of the expiration of our industrial sales contracts and the
implementation of the August price increases should serve to stabilize our
gross margins in the first half of fiscal 2005, barring any further material
increases in nut costs," cautioned Mr. Sanfilippo.  "Though we have seen our
workers' compensation costs increase recently as a result of our growth,
we have responded to this trend by aggressively focusing on work place
safety.  This increased focus on safety, which started at the end of
fiscal 2003, is beginning to deliver positive results as the number of
work place accidents in the first half of calendar 2004 has declined by
approximately 16% versus the same period last year, while the number of
employees has increased,"   Mr. Sanfilippo added.  "The remarkable sales
and earnings growth in fiscal 2004 is the product of hard work on the
part of our employees and the commitment to invest in our business to
meet the needs of our customers.    Though the second half of the fiscal
year has been challenging from a commodity standpoint, our sales growth
did deliver higher gross profit dollars in the fourth quarter, and our
being vertically integrated in the major domestic nuts provided us with
the means to confront this challenge," concluded Mr. Sanfilippo.


The statement of Jasper B. Sanfilippo in this release is forward-
looking.  This forward-looking statement is based on the Company's
current expectations and involves risks and uncertainties.
Consequently, the Company's actual results could differ materially.
Among the factors that could cause results to differ materially from
current expectations are:  (i) sales activity for the Company's
products; (ii) changes in the availability and costs of raw materials
for the production of the Company's products; (iii) fluctuations in the
value of the Company's inventories of pecans, walnuts, almonds, peanuts
or other nuts due to fluctuations in the market prices of these nuts;
(iv) the Company's ability to lessen the negative impact of competitive
pressures by reducing its selling prices and increasing sales volume
while at the same time maintaining profit margins by reducing costs; (v)
the outcome of a pending governmental antitrust investigation of a
portion of the peanut shelling industry; and (vi) the timing and
occurrence (or nonoccurrence) of other transactions and events which may
be subject to circumstances beyond the Company's control.

John B. Sanfilippo & Son, Inc. is a processor, packager, marketer and
distributor of shelled and in-shell nuts and extruded snacks that are
sold under a variety of private labels and under the Company's Fisher,
Evon's, Snack 'N Serve Nut BowlTM, Sunshine Country, Flavor Tree and
Texas Pride brand names.  The Company also markets and distributes a
diverse product line of other food and snack items.
