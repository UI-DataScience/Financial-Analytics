  Benihana Inc. Reports Fiscal 2005 First Quarter Operating Results

    MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 24, 2004--Benihana Inc. ("the
Company") (NASDAQ:BNHNA and BNHN), operator of one of the nation's
largest chains of Asian restaurants, today reported operating results
for the first fiscal quarter (four periods) ended July 18, 2004.
    Total revenues for the first fiscal quarter amounted to $65.4
million, compared with $61.1 million, in the corresponding year ago
period, an increase of 7.0%. Net income totaled $1.9 million, or $0.20
per fully diluted share, based on approximately 9.8 million average
diluted shares outstanding, compared with $3.0 million, or $0.33 per
fully diluted share, based on 9.0 million average diluted shares
outstanding, in the corresponding year-ago period. Net income in the
fiscal 2005 first quarter was affected by higher food costs and
expenses for architectural services related to future construction and
renovations. The quarter's earnings were also unfavorably affected by
increases in workers' compensation expenses, particularly in
California, and by certain non-recurring items.
    Fiscal first quarter restaurant sales increased to $64.9 million,
compared with $60.5 million. Approximately $4.1 million of the
increase was derived from new restaurants and $1.6 million from
increases in comparable sales. As reported previously, total
comparable sales for all concepts in the fiscal first quarter
increased 2.7%, including gains of 1.7% at the teppanyaki restaurants,
5.8% at Haru and 9.9% at RA Sushi.
    Guest counts continued to rise to 2.6 million from 2.5 million a
year ago. Average guest checks company-wide amounted to $23.41 per
person. To offset higher food and other costs at the Benihana
teppanyaki restaurants, prices were increased in mid-July by an
average 2-3%, and indications thus far are that traffic growth has not
slowed as a result.
    Fiscal first quarter restaurant gross profits amounted to $47.7
million, compared with $45.0 million a year ago. Gross profit margin
equaled 73.4%, against 74.3% in the corresponding period last year,
with restaurant operating profits amounting to $9.4 million, compared
with $9.5 million. The decrease in gross profit margin was largely a
result of increased beef prices. Beef represents approximately 40% of
teppanyaki food costs.
    A charge of $550,000 was made to expense the costs for
architectural services in connection with the previously announced
planning and design program for the construction and renovation of the
teppanyaki restaurant chain. The design program was initiated to
produce an exciting, fresh look for existing restaurants, and provide
a template for efficient use of space, lower operating costs and
construction cost savings. The design program is virtually complete
and future expenses associated with the design program are not
expected to be material.
    Other significant charges made during the quarter including the
write-off of certain property in connection with a renovation and
accelerating depreciation and amortization for two other restaurants
for which lease renewal options are unlikely to be made. The Company
also incurred legal costs associated with litigation brought about by
the trust that owns a substantial portion of the Company's Common
Stock (the "Aoki suit"). The Company expects that future costs of the
litigation will be significant but cannot yet estimate the total
amount. The litigation seeks to reverse a transaction that provides
for up to $20 million in cash necessary to achieve the Company's
growth objectives and restaurant renovation program.
    Benihana has begun a trial program in Florida with a national
restaurant supply firm to more effectively deal with fluctuating
commodity and other expenses. The purchasing program is expected to be
in place by the beginning of the fourth quarter. Additionally, an
agreement on a national supply contract recently entered into with
Pepsi for soft drink beverages is similarly expected to benefit food
and beverage costs.
    "Our Company has moved aggressively to deal with the issues that
impacted the first quarter, while also moving forward to continue to
grow Benihana," said Joel A. Schwartz, President and CEO. "We have put
in place a preferred financing that will enable us to assure the
necessary capital for our expansion and remodeling program. The
concepts, Haru and RA Sushi, that we have acquired in recent years,
and the highly renowned Benihana teppanyaki chain, all hold
significant promise, and we remain enthused, excited and confident
about Benihana's outlook and its ability to continue to enhance
shareholder value."

    Fiscal 2005 Second Quarter Outlook

    Comparable sales in the first four-weeks of the second quarter
were strong with comparable sales gains of 7.4 %. The recent menu
price increase is expected to benefit margins at the Teppanyaki
restaurants and, thus far, the increase has not negatively affected
traffic. The Aoki suit litigation costs are likely to be significant
in the second quarter and could extend through the remainder of the
year. Allowing for estimated litigation costs, earnings per diluted
share for the second quarter are estimated to be from $0.13 to $0.15
per share.
