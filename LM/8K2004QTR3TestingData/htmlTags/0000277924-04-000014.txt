NEWS RELEASE

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE          Contact:  James P. Garrett

            CREDO REPORTS RECORD NINE-MONTH EARNINGS
          Increased Production Propels Earnings Growth

DENVER, COLORADO, September 14, 2004 - CREDO Petroleum Corporation (NASDAQ:
CRED) today reported record financial results for the nine months ended July
31, 2004.  Net income rose 39% to a record $2,757,000 on revenue of
$7,562,000 compared to $1,984,000 on revenue of $5,718,000 last year.  On a
per diluted share basis, net income was $.45 compared to $.33 last year.
Cash flow from operating activities (before changes in operating assets and
liabilities) jumped 40% to $4,915,000.

James T. Huffman, President, said, "For the nine months, we established
significant new records in most operational and financial categories,
highlighted by strong production growth and a 21% annualized return on
equity without using leverage."

For the third quarter ended July 31, 2004, net income increased to a record
$806,000.  Fully diluted per share earnings in both periods were $.13.

Huffman further stated, "Fiscal 2004 drilling resulted in significant third
quarter production growth.  However, third quarter results were suppressed
primarily because $429,000 was left-on-the-table due to hedging transactions."

            PRODUCTION VOLUMES SET ANOTHER NEW RECORD

Nine-month production surged 30% to a record 1.48 Bfge (billion cubic feet
of gas-equivalent) compared to 1.14 Bfge last year.  Natural gas production
rose 29% to a record 1.28 Bcfg and oil production rose 27% to 32,900
barrels.  Natural gas accounts for 87% of the company's total production.

Third quarter production rose 19% to 487 MMcfge (million cubic feet of
gas-equivalent) compared to 408 MMcfge last year.  Natural gas production
rose 17% to 417 MMcfg and oil production rose 36% to 11,700 barrels.

              PRODUCT PRICES SHOW CONTINUED STRENGTH

Net wellhead natural gas prices for the nine months rose 25% to $4.96 per
Mcf compared to $3.96 last year.  Hedging transactions reduced wellhead
prices $.38 per Mcf in the nine-month period compared to a reduction of $.39
per Mcf last year.  As a result, total natural gas price realizations rose
5% to $4.58 per Mcf compared to $4.35 last year.  Wellhead oil prices rose
18% to $32.66 per barrel compared to $27.65 last year.

For the third quarter, net wellhead natural gas prices rose 13% to $5.40 per
Mcf compared to $4.77 last year. Hedging transactions reduced wellhead
prices $1.03 per Mcf this year and increased them by $.14 per Mcf last year.
 As a result, total natural gas price realizations fell 11% to $4.37 per Mcf
compared to $4.91 last year.  Wellhead oil prices rose 31% to $34.63 per
barrel compared to $26.41 last year.

At third quarter-end, the company had open hedge positions totaling 200
MMcfg covering the months of September and October 2004 at an average NYMEX
price of $4.80 per Mcf.  Also at third quarter-end, the August hedge was
closed and a deferred loss of $112,000 was realized.  Subsequent to third
quarter end, the September hedge was closed and a deferred loss of $31,000
was realized.  The only remaining hedge is for the month of October 2004.
Average gas prices in the company's market areas are expected to be 15% to
17% below NYMEX prices due to basis differentials and transportation costs.

                     RECORD CAPITAL SPENDING

Capital spending for the nine months totaled a record $4,129,000 on the
company's two core projects--natural gas drilling along the Anadarko Shelf
of Oklahoma and application of the company's patented Calliope gas recovery
technology.  A separate press release has been made today updating those
results.

               STRONG FINANCIAL CONDITION PROVIDES
                   SOLID FOUNDATION FOR GROWTH


At July 31, 2004, working capital was $6,942,000.  Total assets were
$27,945,000 including cash and short-term investments of $7,417,000.
Stockholders' equity was $20,200,000.  The company's only long-term debt is
a $355,000 exclusive license obligation that is payable over seven years.
