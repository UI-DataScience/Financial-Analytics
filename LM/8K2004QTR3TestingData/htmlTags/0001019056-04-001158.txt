              WARRANTECH REPORTS FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 2005 RESULTS


BEDFORD, Texas - Sept. 2, 2004 - Warrantech Corporation (OTC: WTEC), a leading
independent provider of service contracts and after-market warranties, today
announced that it has filed its Form 10-Q for the first quarter ended June 30,
2004 of fiscal year 2005.

         After a cumulative deferral of $238.0 million of gross revenues on the
Balance Sheet to future periods, the newly adopted accounting treatment caused
the company to show a net loss of ($0.8) million or ($0.05) per diluted share
for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 compared to a net loss of ($0.5) million or
($0.03) per diluted share in the first quarter 2004.

         "We have not wavered in our mission," said Joel San Antonio, Warrantech
chairman and chief executive officer. "Despite the new accounting treatment
during fiscal 2004, we started a number of new programs, and made improvements

First Quarter 2005 Financial Results


to Warrantech's management team. Hard work pays off in positive performance.
Although weakness continued in the automotive segment, gross revenues are up in
both the international and consumer product services divisions. In spite of a
weak economy and complex accounting rule changes that obscure the success of our
achievements, I'm proud of what Warrantech and our management team has
accomplished."

Gross Revenues
- --------------

         Gross revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 ended June 30,
2004, were $33.0 million, down 16 percent compared to $39.2 million in the first
quarter fiscal 2004. Gross revenues in the international division rose 11
percent during the first quarter 2005 to $2.1 million, up $0.2 million from $1.9
million in the comparable 2004 quarter. Consumer products services reported
gross revenues of $9.4 million during the first quarter fiscal 2005, up 3
percent or $0.3 million in the same period the previous year. The automotive
division had gross revenues of $21.8 million during the first quarter fiscal
2005, down $6.5 million or 23 percent from $28.3 million in the same quarter in
fiscal 2004.

Direct Costs
- ------------

         Direct costs are primarily insurance premiums and commission expenses
related to the production and acquisition of service contracts. For the first
quarter fiscal 2005, direct costs were $17.4 million, down $5.7 million or 25
percent, from $23.1 million in the same quarter in fiscal 2004. Automotive
direct costs decreased $5.8 million or 32 percent, consumer products direct
costs decreased $0.5 million or 9 percent, while international direct costs
increased $0.1 million or 11 percent during the first quarter fiscal 2005
compared to the same period in fiscal 2004.

First Quarter 2005 Financial Results


Gross Profit
- ------------

         Gross profit for the first quarter 2005 decreased $0.8 million or 11
percent compared to the same period in fiscal 2004. The automotive segment gross
profit increased $0.3 million or 18 percent during the first quarter fiscal 2005
compared to the same period in fiscal 2004. The consumer products gross profit
decreased $0.5 million or 13 percent during the first quarter fiscal 2005
compared to the same period in fiscal 2004. International gross profit increased
$0.1 million, or 9 percent during the first quarter fiscal 2005 compared to the
same quarter in fiscal 2004.

Service, Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A)
- ---------------------------------------------------

         SG&A expenses for the first quarter 2005 were $7.0 million, down $0.4
million or 5 percent from $7.4 million in the first quarter fiscal 2004. Legal
expenses increased $0.3 million during the first quarter 2005 due to litigation
expenses related to the Lloyd's Underwriter's lawsuit and legal advice in
connection with seeking guidance from the staff of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Employee costs were lower at $4.3 million during the first quarter
fiscal 2005 compared to $4.5 million in the same period the previous year due
primarily to efficiencies in total head count. Rent expense decreased by $0.2
million from $0.6 million in the first quarter fiscal 2004 compared to $0.4
million in the same period in fiscal 2005 due to the company's move to the new
corporate headquarters in Bedford, Tx. Depreciation decreased from $0.9 million
in the first quarter of 2004 to $0.7 million in the same period in 2005 due to
the company's planned obsolescence and reduced requirement for capital
expenditures on call center equipment.

Income from Operations
- ----------------------

         For the first quarter fiscal 2005, Warrantech had a loss from
operations of $1.4 million compared to an operating loss of $1.1 million in the
same period last year. The change in income from operations was primarily due to
higher levels of revenue, which must be deferred to future periods.

"Safe Harbor" statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995:
         Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters
discussed in this release may contain forward-looking statements that involve
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. The company makes
such forward-looking statements under the provisions of the "safe harbor"
section of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking
statements reflect the company's views and assumptions, based on information
currently available to management. Such views and assumptions are based on,
among other things, the company's operating and financial performance over
recent years and its expectations about its business for the current and future
fiscal years. Although the company believes that the expectations reflected in
such forward-looking statements are reasonable; it can give no assurance that
such expectations will prove to be correct.

         These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and
assumptions, including, but not limited to, (a) prevailing economic conditions
which may significantly deteriorate, thereby reducing the demand for the
company's products and services, (b) availability of technical support personnel
or increases in the rate of turnover of such personnel, resulting from increased
demand for such qualified personnel, (c) changes in the terms or availability of
insurance coverage for the company's programs, (d) regulatory or legal changes
affecting the company's business, (e) loss of business from, or significant
change in relationships with any major customer, (f) the ability to successfully
identify and contract new business opportunities, both domestically and
internationally, (g) the ability to secure necessary capital for general
operating or expansion purposes, (h) the adverse outcomes of litigation, (i) the
non-payment of notes due from an officer and two directors of the company in
2007 which would result in a charge against earnings in the period in which the
event occurred, (j) the inability of any of the insurance companies which insure
the service contracts marketed and administered by the company to pay the claims
under the service contracts, (k) the termination of extended credit terms being
provided by the company's current insurance company, (l) the development of
facts and circumstances which could affect existing accounting policies, and (m)
the illiquidity of the company's common stock. Should one or more of these or
any other risks or uncertainties materialize or develop in a manner adverse to
the company, or should the company's underlying assumptions prove incorrect,
actual results of operations, cash flows or the company's financial condition
may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or expected and there
could be a materially adverse effect on the company's business.
