          Teletouch Reports Results for Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2004

     TYLER, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 31, 2004--Teletouch Communications,
Inc. (AMEX:TLL) today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended May
31, 2004.
     "Our two-way radio division had record sales in the fourth quarter as state
and local governments began to upgrade their radio systems as a result of
increased funding for Homeland Security," stated J. Kernan Crotty, President of
Teletouch Communications, Inc. "We anticipate the increased demand for two-way
radio equipment will continue into fiscal 2005. Additionally, during the
quarter, Teletouch completed the acquisition of Preferred Networks, Inc. which
will allow the Company to provide paging service throughout most of Georgia."
     "In the fourth quarter, we formed a new subsidiary, Visao Systems, Inc., to
focus on telemetry sales. We recorded the first sales of our LifeGuard telemetry
device, a personal monitoring unit, in the fourth quarter to a Fortune 50
company. We have a number of telemetry devices in trial programs with customers
but the sales cycle is a lot longer than we had expected and we will be
monitoring and assessing the division's progress over the next six months,"
concluded Mr. Crotty.

     Fourth Quarter 2004 Results

     Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $6.7 million compared with $7.4
million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The decline in revenue since last
year was primarily due to fewer pagers in service. Pagers in service declined
22.8% to 168,000 compared with 217,700 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.
The decline in pagers in service was the result of lower demand for one-way
paging services. Product sales increased to $1,322,000 compared with $923,000 in
the fourth quarter of last fiscal year primarily due to higher sales of two-way
radio equipment, offset by lower sales of paging equipment.
     Net loss applicable to common stockholders was $135,000 in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004 compared with net income applicable to common
stockholders of $484,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Net loss per
diluted share was $0.03 on 4.5 million weighted average shares outstanding
compared with net income per share of $0.01 on 54.6 million weighted average
shares outstanding in the same period of the prior year.

     Fiscal 2004 Results

     Total revenues for fiscal 2004 were $26.8 million compared with $34.8
million in fiscal 2003. The decline in revenues was due to fewer pagers in
service. Pagers in service declined to 168,000 at fiscal year end compared with
217,700 at fiscal year end 2003.
     Teletouch reduced total debt in fiscal 2004. At fiscal year-end, short-term
debt was $0 compared with $109,000 in fiscal 2003. Long-term debt was reduced to
$448,000 in fiscal 2004 compared with $760,000 in fiscal 2003.
     Teletouch's operating loss was $166,000 in fiscal 2004 compared with
operating loss of $1,688,000 million in fiscal 2003. The reduction in operating
loss, excluding restructuring costs, was primarily due to Teletouch's exit of
its retail distribution channel in fiscal 2003. Costs declined for operations,
selling, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization by 15.2%
to $19.6 million in fiscal 2004 compared with $23.2 million in the prior year
but increased to 73% of revenues in 2004 compared with 67% of revenues in 2003.
     The Company recorded a net loss applicable to common stockholders of
$519,000, or $0.11 per diluted share, in fiscal 2004 compared with net income
available to common stockholders of $35.6 million, or $0.39 per diluted share,
in fiscal 2003. The fiscal 2003 results include a $36.4 million gain on
preferred stock transaction.
