<p><font size="2" face="serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 20, 2004, Stonepath Group, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) issued a press release entitled, &#8220;Stonepath Group (AMEX:STG) Announces Intention to Restate 2003 and First and Second Quarter 2004 Financial Statements &#150; Highlights Organizational Changes.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full text of the Company&#8217;s press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.</font></p>
<p><font face="serif" size="2"><b>Item 4.02. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review</u></b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 17, 2004 the Company concluded that its financial statements for 2003 and the first and second quarters of 2004 should not be relied upon.  </font>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of a review of the process by which the Company&#146;s Domestic unit maintained its accrual for the costs of purchased transportation, the Company determined that it had understated its accrued purchased transportation liability and related costs of purchased transportation.  The amount of the under accrual is estimated in the range of $4.0 million to $6.0 million for 2003 and in the range of $0.5 million to $1.0 million for the first six months of 2004.  After giving effect for these estimated incremental expenses, the Company&#8217;s reported EBITDA would be reduced to a range of $2.6 million to $4.6 million for 2003 and reduced to a range of $200,000 to $700,000 for the first six months of 2004.</font>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company believes that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, is a useful financial measure of our financial performance for investors. Under GAAP, our net income reflects the amortization of intangible assets arising from the Company&#146;s past acquisitions and other non-cash charges. However, we believe that we are actually growing the value of our intangible assets through our acquisition strategy. Management of the Company believes that EBITDA is a useful measure because it eliminates the effect of these non-cash costs and provides an important metric of the economic reality of the business. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="serif" size="1">* Prior to the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company maintained a valuation allowance to offset 100% of the net deferred tax assets associated with the tax losses generated prior to the Company&#146;s move into the logistics business. In the fourth quarter of 2003, a portion of the valuation allowance was reversed, resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax asset and related nonrecurring non-cash tax benefit of $1.7 million, resulting in an overall income tax benefit of $1.3 million. For purposes of developing its preliminary estimate of the impact of the adjustment for the purchased transportation accrual, the Company has not tax affected the adjustment and has assumed that the adjustment would not impact the Company&#8217;s basis for reversing a
portion of its valuation allowance.</font></p>

               STONEPATH GROUP (AMEX: STG) ANNOUNCES INTENTION TO
            RESTATE 2003 AND FIRST AND SECOND QUARTER 2004 FINANCIAL
                                   STATEMENTS

                        HIGHLIGHTS ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES
________________________________________________________________________________

PHILADELPHIA, PA, September 20, 2004 - Stonepath Group (AMEX: STG) today
announced that it will restate its financial statements for 2003 and the first
and second quarters of 2004. As a result of an internal review of the process by
which the Company's Domestic Services unit maintained its accrual for the costs
of purchased transportation, the Company determined that it had understated its
accrued purchased transportation liability and related costs of purchased
transportation. The amount of the under accrual is estimated to be in the range
of $4.0-$6.0 million for 2003 and in the range of $500,000 to $1.0 million for
the first six months of 2004. After giving effect for these estimated
incremental expenses, the Company's reported EBITDA would be reduced to the
range of $2.6-$4.6 million for 2003 and reduced to the range of
$200,000-$700,000 for the first six months of 2004.

Reconciliations of the EBITDA amounts contained in this press release to the
most directly comparable GAAP amounts are included at the end of this press
release.

In using its legacy operating system, to be replaced by Tech-Logis later this
year, Domestic Services relied on trend analysis to estimate its costs of
purchased transportation. In reviewing the process by which Domestic Services
maintained the accrual for its costs of purchased transportation, the Company
has concluded that the process did not accurately account for the differences
between the estimates and the actual freight costs incurred. This allowed for
the accumulation of previously unidentified costs of purchased transportation
and an under reported liability for the accrued costs of purchased
transportation.

The Company has discussed this issue with its recently engaged external
auditors, Grant Thornton LLP. It has also advised its previous auditors, KPMG
LLP which had audited the Company's financial statements for 2003. The Company
is in the process of preparing an amended report on Form 10-K/A for 2003 and
amended reports on Form 10-Q/A for the first and second quarters of this year.

The anticipated restatement of operating results for 2003 and 2004 is not
expected to have an impact on the Company's cash position and will not affect
Stonepath's ability to provide the high-quality logistics services its customers
have come to expect.

The Company is also reviewing its financial guidance. In addition, the Company
is assessing what, if any, impact these events will have on the Company's
ability to comply with its certification process with respect to the
effectiveness of its internal controls and procedures for financial reporting
required pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in connection
with the filing of the Company's 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The Company has also communicated these events to its bank and expects to
continue to enjoy significant availability under its existing credit facility
subject to waivers of certain financial covenants which the Company expects to
secure.

Dennis L. Pelino, Chairman and CEO, commented: "We have identified this problem
and we believe we understand the issues. Now we must make significant changes in
our organization to address these issues and ensure that nothing like this ever
happens again. To strengthen our operations and begin streamlining the
management reporting structure, we have made several key management changes.
Jason Totah, the CEO of our international operations, will also become the CEO
at Domestic Services as of September 27, 2004. This move will put all of our
logistics operations under one proven leader who will oversee the functional and
operational integration of the divisions as we roll out Tech-Logis in the U.S.
by end of the year."

Mr. Pelino added: "The Company has also restructured its financial organization
to have the senior financial staff of its Domestic Services and International
Services operations report directly to Bohn Crain, the Company's Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer. The Company also intends to add a senior
accounting officer to reside in Minneapolis to provide technical support and
oversight to the financial reporting and accounting staff of the Company's
Domestic Services and International Services operations and to interface with
the Company's corporate staff in Philadelphia."

Pelino continued: "On the positive side, the earn-out methodology we use to
effect our acquisitions provides the Company with the ultimate back-stop in this
situation. The incremental purchased transportation expense identified through
our review process reduces the earn-out distributions that should have been paid
to the former owners. As a result of this earn-out mechanism, the cash impact of
these adjustments should ultimately be borne directly by the former owners of
the businesses we have acquired rather than the Company itself."

"Our Executive Committee, which I co-chair with Bohn Crain, has been working
well since its establishment in May, and is beginning to have a very positive
impact on how we will be structured as a Company going forward."

Pelino closed, "We are very confident in our future, and feel strongly that we
have our hands around the accounting issues that have slowed us down, putting us
on track for a solid 2005 and beyond."

The Company believes that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or EBITDA, is a useful financial measure of our financial
performance for investors. Under GAAP, our net income reflects the amortization
of intangible assets arising from the Company's past acquisitions and other
non-cash charges. However, we believe that we are actually growing the value of
our intangible assets through our acquisition strategy. Management of the
Company believes that EBITDA is a useful measure because it eliminates the
effect of these non-cash costs and provides an important metric of the economic
reality of the business. The following is a reconciliation of the projected
EBITDA information contained in this press release to the most comparable
projected GAAP amounts.

In accordance with SEC Regulation S-K, a reconciliation of EBITDA estimates for
2003 and for the first six months of 2004 (as adjusted for the purchased
transportation accrual) to the most directly comparable GAAP measure follows:

         * Prior to the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company maintained a
         valuation allowance to offset 100% of the net deferred tax assets
         associated with the tax losses generated prior to the Company's move
         into the logistics business. In the fourth quarter of 2003, a portion
         of the valuation allowance was reversed, resulting in the recognition
         of a deferred tax asset and related nonrecurring non-cash tax benefit
         of $1.7 million, resulting in an overall income tax benefit of $1.3
         million. For purposes of developing its preliminary estimate of the
         impact of the adjustment for the purchased transportation accrual, the
         Company has not tax affected the adjustment and has assumed that the
         adjustment would not impact the Company's basis for reversing a portion
         of its valuation allowance.
