For  Immediate  Release

                   Lantronix, Inc. Reports Fiscal 2004 Results

Irvine,  CA,  September  9,  2004  - Irvine, CA - Lantronix, Inc. (NASDAQ: LTRX)
today  reported  results  from its continuing operations for its fiscal year and
fourth  quarter  ended  June  30,  2004:

- -     Revenues  for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 were $48.9 million, flat
with  the  same  period  last  year  when  the company recorded $49.4 million in
revenues.

- -     Net  loss  was reduced to $(15.7) million, or $(0.28) per share for fiscal
2004,  compared  with  net loss of $(47.5) million, or $(0.88) per share for the
previous  fiscal  year.  Results  for fiscal 2004 included a $5.0 million charge
related  to  the  company's  remaining  investment  in  Xanboo,  an  early stage
technology  company.

- -     Operating  loss  was  reduced  to $(5.6) million for fiscal 2004, compared
with  operating  loss  of  $(36.5)  million  for  fiscal  2003.

- -     Revenue  from  the company's core product lines was up 14% for the quarter
ended  June  2004  compared  to  the  same  period  last  year.

- -     Revenue  from  the  Device  Networking products was up 31% for the quarter
ended  June  30,  2004  compared  to  the  same  period  last  year.

For  the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004, the company reported revenues of $48.9
million  and  net  loss from continuing operations of $(5.6) million, or $(0.19)
per  share, compared with revenues of $49.4 million and net loss from continuing
operations  of  $(37.4)  million,  or $(0.69) per share for the same period last
year.

Net loss from discontinued operations of the company's Premise subsidiary, which
was  sold  during  the  third fiscal quarter, was $(5.0) million, or $(0.09) per
share, and $(10.1) million, or $(0.19) per share for the fiscal years ended June
30,  2004,  and  2003,  respectively.

For  the  fourth fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2004, Lantronix recorded revenues
of  $11.9  million and net loss from continuing operations of $(6.9) million, or
$(0.12)  per  share, compared with revenues of $11.8 million and a net loss from
continuing  operations  of  $(13.0)  million, or $(0.24) per share, for the same
period last year.   Results for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, included a $5.0
million  charge for the write-off of a long-term asset, related to the company's
investment  in Xanboo, an early stage technology company, compared to impairment
and  restructuring  charges  of  $3.0  million  for  the  same period last year.

Net income from discontinued operations was $138,000, or $0.00 per share for the
quarter  ended  June  30,  2004,  compared with a net loss of $(6.1) million, or
$(0.11)  per  share  for  the  quarter  ended  June  30,  2003.

Net  loss  was  $(6.8)  million,  or  $(0.12) per share, and $(19.1) million, or
$(0.35)  per share for the quarters ended June 30, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities  decreased  approximately
$685,000  during  the  quarter  ended June 30, 2004, compared with a decrease of
$459,000  for  the  same  period  a year earlier, and in line with the company's
earlier guidance of cash usage in the range of $1 million. The company indicated
that  it  would  have  cash  usage  in the range of $2.2 to $2.8 million for the
current  quarter  ending September 30, 2004, as a result of the payment of notes
incurred  in  connection  with  the  Stallion acquisition two years earlier, tax
audit payments, and higher expenses for the quarter related to the launch of new
products.  Cash  usage  is  anticipated to return to the range of $1 million per
quarter  in  the second fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2004, and the company
affirmed  its  current  cash flow breakeven to be in the revenue range of $14 to
$15  million  per  quarter.

"We  experienced  flat overall revenue for the recently completed year, however,
this result masks a significant shift in sales towards our core product lines of
Device  Networking  and IT Management, and away from legacy non-core offerings,"
stated  Marc  Nussbaum,  president  and  CEO.  "Growth  in  our  core  products
accelerated  in  the  latter  half  of the fiscal year. We are seeing signs that
momentum  is  beginning to build in the Device Networking market as evidenced by
our  revenue  growth  and  a  50%  increase in unit sales compared to last year.

FISCAL  2005  QUARTER  OUTLOOK

The  following  statements  are  forward-looking  and  are  based  on  current
expectations.  Statements  about future revenues, product successes or sales, or
cash  usage are subject to variations in any specific period. Actual results may
differ  materially  from  those  described  below.  The  company  undertakes  no
obligation  to  update  this  release.

"We  expect  revenues  to  be  relatively flat in fiscal Q1 with top line growth
expected  in  the  December  quarter. Our full year fiscal 2005 outlook includes
overall  top  line  revenue  growth and we reiterate our expectation of reaching
positive  cash  flow  from  operations at $14 to 15 million in quarterly sales,"
Nussbaum  said.
