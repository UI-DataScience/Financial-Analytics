Centennial Communications to Sell Its Puerto Rico Cable
Television Properties for $155 Million

WALL, N.J.-- Sept. 7, 2004--Centennial  Communications Corp. (NASDAQ:CYCL) today
announced  that it has entered  into a  definitive  agreement to sell its wholly
owned subsidiary, Centennial Puerto Rico Cable TV Corp. ("Centennial Cable TV"),
to Hicks,  Muse, Tate & Furst  Incorporated  for  approximately  $155 million in
cash.  Completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions,
including  regulatory  approval of the transfer of  Centennial  Cable TV's cable
franchises, and is expected to occur in early 2005.

Centennial  Cable TV  operates a digital  cable  television  system  that serves
approximately  73,000  subscribers and passes over 300,000  contiguous  homes in
southern  and  western  Puerto  Rico.  For the fiscal  year ended May 31,  2004,
Centennial  Cable  TV's  "Adjusted   Operating   Income"  ("AOI")   contribution
represented less than 5% of Centennial  Communications'  total consolidated AOI.
AOI  is  net  income  (loss)  before  income  tax  expense  (benefit),  interest
expense-net, loss on impairment or disposition of equipment and depreciation and
amortization.

"This has proven to be a good time to monetize our cable television business and
this transaction  accelerates the de-leveraging of the Company," said Michael J.
Small, chief executive officer of Centennial.

The Company  expects  this to be a tax-free  transaction,  the proceeds of which
would be used to fund the build out of the  Lansing and Grand  Rapids,  Michigan
licenses  the  Company  expects to acquire  from AT&T  Wireless as well as other
capital requirements  contemplated in the Company's fiscal year 2004 guidance of
$160 million in capital  expenditures.  Waller Capital  Corporation  represented
Centennial in the transaction.
