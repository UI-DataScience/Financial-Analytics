                LONGVIEW FIBRE COMPANY REPORTS IMPROVED
                    THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS

     LONGVIEW, Wash., August 24, 2004 - Longview Fibre Company (NYSE:LFB)
today announced net income of $7.9 million, or $0.15 per share, for its third
fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2004, compared with a net loss of $177,000, or
$0.00 per share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2003.  Net sales increased
13.5 percent, to $220.5 million, in the quarter ended July 31, 2004, compared
with $194.3 million for the same period last year.
     R. H. Wollenberg, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer,
said, "Our third quarter results reflect strengthening in demand in each of
our operating segments and improved operating efficiency in each of our
segments compared to last year's third quarter.
     "Demand and pricing for logs and lumber reflected a strong U.S. housing
market and, although our log harvest plan calls for a sequential reduction in
our timber harvest in the fourth quarter, we should continue to benefit from
the strong pricing environment.  The housing market is also buoying demand
for many of our specialty paper grades used in construction materials.  In
our converted products segment, the Northwest has experienced an early and
bountiful fruit-growing season that is already beginning to project into
increased seasonal demand for our fourth fiscal quarter.  Our order backlog
reflects these healthy demand dynamics heading into what is typically our
strongest fiscal quarter.  The pricing outlook is more favorable than it has
been in several years, with additional box and kraft paper price increases
scheduled to take effect in August and September, following the price
recovery that began in the third quarter."
     Mr. Wollenberg concluded, "Each of our operating segments appears
poised for a strong fourth quarter."

Third Quarter Fiscal 2004 Compared with the Third Quarter Fiscal 2003

     Timber segment sales in the third quarter increased 35.9 percent, to
$54.4 million from $40.1 million, and operating profit grew 67.4 percent, to
$24.9 million from $14.9 million, compared with the same period last year.
Log sales increased 35.0 percent on a 17.5 percent volume increase, coupled
with a 15.0 percent increase in average log prices.  Domestic log volume
increased 24.4 percent to 55.3 million board feet, while average prices
increased 20.5 percent compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2003 and 4.0
percent sequentially.  Export log sales increased 7.9 percent as average
prices increased 8.4 percent, partially offset by a 0.4 percent decrease in
volume, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2003.  Log volume reflected
strong demand and favorable summer harvest conditions.  The company's log
harvest plan anticipates a fourth quarter timber sale of between 55 and 60
million board feet and continued improvement in pricing.  Lumber sales
continued to benefit from the strong U.S. housing market, increasing 39.0
percent on a 43.5 percent increase in average lumber prices.  The price
improvement was partially offset by a 3.3 percent decrease in volume due to
production curtailment caused by capital improvement projects during the
third quarter.
     In the company's paper and paperboard segment, strengthening demand
resulted in a 20.1 percent sales increase over last year's third quarter, to
$63.9 million from $53.2 million.  Volume increased 26.6 percent.  The
increased volume resulted in an 83 percent utilization rate at the company's
Longview mill, helping the segment cut its third quarter operating loss in
half, to $1.4 million, compared with an operating loss of $3.0 million for
the same period last year.  In last year's third quarter, the Longview mill
operated at 68 percent utilization.
     The company expects a utilization rate of approximately 85 to 90
percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, which ends October 31, based on
anticipated continued strengthening of cyclical demand coupled with strong
seasonal demand.
     Paper sales in the third quarter increased 10.6 percent to $51.2
million from $46.3 million in the prior year period.  Paper volume increased
11.9 percent, partially offset by a 1.2 percent price decline from the third
quarter of 2003.  Domestic paper sales increased 13.6 percent over last
year's third quarter on a 15.1 percent increase in volume, partially offset
by 1.2 percent lower average prices.  Sequentially, domestic paper prices
improved 5.3 percent, reflecting price increases that were implemented in the
third fiscal quarter.  Export paper sales declined 1.2 percent on a 3.3
percent decrease in average price partially offset by a 1.7 percent increase
in volume.
     Paperboard sales in the third quarter increased 83.3 percent, to $12.7
million from $6.9 million in the prior year period.  Domestic paperboard
sales increased 83.0 percent over the third quarter of fiscal 2003 as volume
increased 98.9 percent, partially offset by a 9.3 percent decline in average
prices due in part to product mix.  Export paperboard sales grew 83.6 percent
on 75.4 percent higher volume, coupled with a 4.7 percent increase in average
price.
     Although paper and paperboard each had modest price declines year over
year, they showed sequential price improvements of 4.4 percent and 2.4
percent, respectively, compared with second fiscal quarter 2004.
     The company's converted products segment recorded a sales increase of
1.1 percent from the third quarter of fiscal 2003, to $102.1 million from
$101.0 million, reflecting a 1.0 percent volume increase.  Pricing improved
2.1 percent sequentially from second fiscal quarter 2004, partially reversing
the price erosion experienced during the prior three quarters.  The segment
reported an operating loss of $2.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal
2004, compared with an operating loss of $1.5 million for the same period
last year, primarily due to higher cost of linerboard.
     Cash provided by operations totaled $18.4 million during the third
quarter.  Capital expenditures totaled $17.2 million, including $14.8 million
in plant and equipment additions and $2.4 million in timber and timberland
purchases.  The company also used approximately $3.0 million of its quarterly
cash flow to reduce borrowed debt during the third quarter, bringing the
balance to approximately $495.1 million, $30.8 million below the balance one
year ago.
