       Electro Rent Corporation Reports Higher Revenue and
    Net Income for Fiscal 2005 First Quarter Versus Prior Year


  VAN NUYS, CALIFORNIA, September 16, 2004 - Electro Rent
Corporation (NASDAQ:ELRC) today announced higher revenue and net
income for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 compared to the same
period of the prior year.  "Net income continued to improve,
extending the upward trend that began a year ago.  The quarter
also marked the first positive revenue comparison in several
years.  Our first quarter performance provides significant
evidence that opportunities for Electro Rent that were only on
the horizon last year are now taking root in the marketplace,"
said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel Greenberg.


First Quarter Results
  For the three months ended August 31, 2004, revenue increased
13% to $25.6 million from $22.7 million for the first quarter of
fiscal 2004.  Net income increased to $5.6 million, or $0.22 per
diluted share, which included $1.8 million (pre-tax) related to
funds received from a class action lawsuit.  This compares to net
income for the same period last year of $2.1 million, or $0.09
per diluted share.


Operations Review
  "We are seeing strength across the entire spectrum of our test
and measurement business, especially in wireless communications,
aerospace/defense and manufacturing.  Rental and lease demand and
rates in our data products business also improved modestly in the
first quarter," Greenberg said.
  Greenberg noted that SG&A expenses declined by $439,000, or
5.6%, during the first quarter despite the increase in revenue.
"The many steps we took during the difficult past few years to
reduce our costs and increase our operating efficiencies, as well
as to enhance customer service and prepare for new market
opportunities, have come together to serve us in good stead.  We
believe that we can now significantly increase our volume this
year while holding the line on expenses," he said.
  "With the improvement in the business climate creating new
opportunities for us to profitably deploy our assets, new
equipment purchases have increased in recent months and we

currently are investing rather than accumulating cash," Greenberg
noted.  Purchases of new equipment for this year's first quarter
increased to $21.8 million, compared to $10.3 million for the
first quarter of fiscal 2004, while cash and marketable
securities declined to $76.1 million from $82.2 million at May
31, 2004.  The book value of Electro Rent's equipment pool rose
to $107.0 million at August 31, 2004 compared to $96.3 million at
May 31, 2004 and $86.3 million at August 31, 2003.
  Electro Rent has no debt, and shareholders' equity at August
31, 2004 was $174.3 million.
