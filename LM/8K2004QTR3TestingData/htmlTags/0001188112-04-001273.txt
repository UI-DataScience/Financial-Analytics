NEWS RELEASE

                THE MIIX GROUP ANNOUNCES REGULATOR SEEKS TO PLACE
                     INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY IN REHABILITATION


LAWRENCEVILLE, NJ, AUGUST 24, 2004 - The MIIX Group, Incorporated (OTC: MIIX)
announced today that the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance
("Department") has filed an application for an Order to Show Cause seeking to
place one of its insurance subsidiaries, MIIX Insurance Company ("MIIX
Insurance"), in rehabilitation. The Department is seeking from the court entry
of an Order to Show Cause that would: a) maintain in force MIIX Insurance's
current Management Services Agreement with The MIIX Group and New Jersey State
Medical Underwriter's, Inc. until the Order of Rehabilitation is entered; and b)
prohibit the filing of new lawsuits against MIIX Insurance without the
permission of the Department or the court. The Department is also seeking from
the court entry of an Order of Rehabilitation that would, after a hearing,
appoint the Department's Commissioner as Rehabilitator of MIIX Insurance with
immediate and exclusive control over the business and property of MIIX
Insurance.

The Company has not consented to the entry of the orders requested by the
Department.



Forward-Looking Statement

This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the
Company's expectations concerning future events and are subject to certain risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those reflected in the forward-looking statements. In particular, the
Department's action in seeking rehabilitation will adversely affect the
Company's ability to manage its runoff and to restructure its operations or sell
its assets and to continue as a going concern. These and other uncertainties and
other factors are detailed from time to time in the Company's filings with the
appropriate securities commissions, and include, without limitation, the Company
having sufficient liquidity and working capital, the performance

<PAGE>

of the Company's investment portfolio, the Company's ability to manage claims,
maintaining existing reinsurance agreements at reasonable terms, the Company's
ability to diversify its product lines, the continued adequacy of the Company's
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, the Company's avoidance of any
material loss on collection of reinsurance recoverables, adverse actions of
applicable regulatory agencies, general economic conditions, including changing
interest rates, rates of inflation and the performance of the financial markets,
adverse judicial decisions and rulings, changes in domestic and foreign laws,
regulations and taxes, effects of acquisitions and divestitures and various
other factors. The words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "project" and
similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. The Company's
expectations regarding future earnings, growth initiatives, underwriting, cost
controls, adequacy of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, and enhancing
shareholder value depend on a variety of factors, including economic,
competitive and market conditions which may be beyond the Company's control and
are thus difficult or impossible to predict. In light of the significant
uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking information herein, the inclusion
of such information should not be regarded as representation by the Company or
any other person that the Company's objectives or plans will be realized.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements, which speak only as of their dates. The Company undertakes no
obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether
as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
