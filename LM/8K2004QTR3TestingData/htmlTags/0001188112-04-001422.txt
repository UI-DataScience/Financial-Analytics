                         TRACTOR SUPPLY COMPANY PROVIDES
                          THIRD QUARTER BUSINESS UPDATE
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BRENTWOOD, TENNESSEE, SEPTEMBER 29, 2004 - Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:
TSCO), the largest retail farm and ranch store chain in the United States, today
provided a business update for the third quarter ended September 25, 2004.

Net sales for the quarter increased 18.1% to $426 million from $361 million last
year, exceeding the Company's previously announced guidance for net sales in the
$390 to $400 million range. Same-store sales increased 10.1%, versus last year's
13.7% gain.

During the third quarter, the Company's sales result was better than anticipated
primarily due to strong sales of emergency response items, particularly in the
Southeast region, as well as a higher level of promotional activity compared to
the year ago period. However, the Company's gross margin was negatively impacted
by several factors including:

     -    Sales of lower margin hurricane related products.

     -    Higher year-over-year levels of promotional activity.

     -    A later than expected start to the Fall/Winter selling season, which
          negatively impacted the sale of higher margin seasonal products.

     -    Greater than anticipated freight costs coupled with difficulty passing
          through steel and other commodity costs to consumers.

     -    A higher LIFO reserve due to increased product costs.

In addition, selling, general and administrative expenses were higher primarily
due to reset activity, uninsured losses and increased legal and accounting
expenses.

While the process of evaluating inventories and operating costs is not yet
complete, the Company currently anticipates net income, excluding an estimated
$1.9 million after-tax charge related to the consolidation and relocation of the
Company's store support center, to be between $8.5 and $9.5 million, or $0.20 to
$0.23 per diluted share. This compares to the Company's previous expectation for
net income, excluding the above referenced charge, of $11.0 to $12.4 million, or
$0.26 to $0.29 per diluted share.

Including the aforementioned charge, net income is anticipated to be in the
range of $6.6 to $7.6 million, or $0.16 to $0.18 per diluted share, for the
third quarter. This compares to the Company's previous guidance, including the
charge, of $9.0 to $10.4 million, or $0.21 to $0.24 per diluted share, for the
third quarter.

Joe Scarlett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated, "We have not fully
assessed the potential impact of the above conditions on our fourth quarter
sales, margin and profits. However, we have now completed the significant third
quarter reset activity and we are taking steps to improve our margins. For
example, next week, as part of our annual vendor conference, we will be holding
a series of meetings titled "Working Collaboratively to Reduce Supply Chain
Costs." We continue to believe we are well positioned to continue to drive
long-term growth and deliver shareholder value."
