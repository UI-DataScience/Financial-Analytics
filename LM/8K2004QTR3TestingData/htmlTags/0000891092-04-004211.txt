</font>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Opening Remarks </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Good Morning ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome to the Duckwall-ALCO Stores second quarter conference call. This is our first
quarterly conference call, and we look forward to providing our investors with an update
on our company&#146;s developments and progress on a regular basis in the future. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>As you can see from the press
release that went out earlier this morning, our second quarter earnings were down from
last year. While the modest decline in earnings can be partially attributed to a
difficult retailing environment and certain non-recurring items, management is not
satisfied with the Company&#146;s performance in the most recent quarter, and we continue to
focus upon ways to improve future results and enhance shareholder value. I would now like
to ask Dick Mansfield, our Chief Financial Officer, to review our second quarter and
year-to-date results...................Dick. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Thanks Glen, </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>This was a quarter in which we saw a
decline in our net earnings compared to last year, but the decline can be more than
explained by unusual, largely non-recurring items. Let me walk you through the key
operating results for the second quarter and six months: </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Second Quarter </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The following comments relate to the
second quarter ended August 1, 2004: </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Net sales increased 0.8% to $109.6
million, while same-store sales rose approximately 0.1%. We believe that, compared to
last year, sales were impacted by higher gasoline prices that affected discretionary
spending, the absence of Federal Income tax rebates distributed during the summer of last
year, the shift of a Texas sales tax &#147;holiday&#148; from July last year to August this year,
generally much cooler weather patterns that impacted sales of warm weather products such
as fans, and the timing of a back-to-school advertising circular for the Duckwall
division. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Gross margin increased slightly to
32.9% of sales from 32.7% last year. This is a very positive sign and was a result of
lower shrinkage and merchandise acquisition costs, as well as the ability of our
logistics department to reduce transportation costs despite significantly higher fuel
prices and legislation that negatively impacted the long-haul trucking industry. These
improvements were partially offset by slightly higher promotional markdowns, as our
customers purchased more products on sale. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Operating expenses increased to
30.8% of sales from 30.4% last year. A significant factor in this increase was general
insurance costs, which rose $625,000 (0.6% of sales),  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>primarily due to an adjustment in
the company&#146;s insurance reserves for workers compensation for the policy year ended
5/31/04, as a result of revised actuarial estimates. We also experienced unusually high
medical insurance costs and credit card processing fees rose due to higher credit card
usage by our customers. These expenses were partially offset by lower depreciation and
store remodeling costs, along with another solid performance from our distribution
center. Additionally, we recorded a $275,000 reduction in expenses related to layaways,
while there was no such adjustment in last year&#146;s second quarter. </FONT></P>

steps to reduce medical and workers compensation expenses and will closely monitor the

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Interest expense declined to
$279,000 for the second quarter, from $328,000 last year, primarily due to lower

were $1,234,000, or $0.28 cents per diluted share, compared with $1,341,000, or $0.31 per
diluted share last year. The decline relative to last year can be substantially explained
by the largely non-recurring items discussed earlier. The increase in general insurance
alone, which was primarily due to a non-recurring adjustment, cost us $0.09 cents a share
compared to last year. </FONT></P>

of discontinued operations, totaled $1,187,000, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared with
$1,341,000, or $0.37 per diluted share last year. Discontinued operations last year
benefited from a gain on the sale of a store of approximately $259,000, or $0.04 per
diluted share. The balance of the shortfall, relative to last year&#146;s net earnings, can be
attributed to previously explained increases in operating expenses. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>I would just like to conclude my
remarks by pointing out that if it hadn&#146;t been for largely non-recurring items and
unusual spikes in expenses, our second quarter and six month earnings would have exceeded
prior-year levels. As I pointed out earlier, this is only the 2nd quarter in the last 12
with a decline. Our diluted earnings per share have grown steadily from $1.00 in fiscal
year 2001, to $1.50 last year, a 50% increase during those 3 years. Also, the $1.50
diluted EPS last year is the highest it has been during the 7 years I have been here. Our
stock price has responded to those solid results and our efforts to improve shareholder
value, by more than tripling since then, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined. </FONT></P>

With regards to the higher general insurance costs that Dick alluded          to, this
was our first year to be essentially self insured. At the          beginning of the
initial plan year our underwriter, Liberty Mutual,          along with actuaries retained
by our insurance brokers, provided us          with what we considered a reasonable
estimate for expense accruals.          After the plan year ended on May 31, 2004, which
was during our second          fiscal quarter, we were informed that previous reserves
were inadequate          due to escalating costs per claim. As a result, we had to
increase our          workers compensation reserves significantly in the most recent
quarter. </FONT></TD>

While
the costs per claim have been higher than originally anticipated,          we are pleased
to report that the number of workers compensation claims          have dropped over 15%

reduce our losses. Such actions include safety          training initiatives for our
managers, management training seminars,          monthly safety videos and Loss

We are also essentially self insured for medical insurance. During          the past 2
fiscal years, we have managed our medical expenses well and,          in fact, costs were
below the estimates provided by our insurance          broker in each of those years.
However, medical insurance expenses          began to spike upwards in the first half of
the current fiscal year. We          have responded to this situation by taking steps to
increase the          premiums paid by our associates and by implementing other changes

I would like to make a few comments regarding the challenging retail          climate in
which we operated during the most recent quarter. I do          believe that high
gasoline prices have affected consumer discretionary          spending. This coupled with
unseasonably cool weather negatively          impacted sales of warm weather product
categories. While a greater          emphasis upon consumable products within our stores
has proven          successful, sales comparisons in more discretionary product
categories          were much more difficult in the second quarter. </FONT></TD>

efficiencies, along with cost control measures, in order to optimize the company&#146;s
financial performance. We will do so in a manner that is consistent with the provision of
excellence in product quality and customer service, because we believe this is the only
way to maximize shareholder values in the long-run. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Let me now move on to a more recent
development that was reported by the financial newswire services on Friday. I expect many
of you have seen or heard about the letter I received from Raymond French of Strongbow
Capital last week. It was dated August 19, 2004 and was attached as an exhibit to
amendment to a Schedule 13D filed by Strongbow Capital on that same date. I did not
receive the letter until after the conclusion of our regularly scheduled Board meeting on
August 19th. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Mr. French put forth a number of
suggestions in his five page letter to me regarding the ways that he believes the
performance of the Company can be improved. Given our prior announcement regarding the
timing of this call, it is unfortunate that Mr. French did not provide us with an
adequate amount of time to carefully consider and respond to his views during this call.
We nevertheless welcome the constructive views of all of our shareholders and recognize
that a nine percent owner like Strongbow clearly deserves a thoughtful response to its
input regarding the future direction of the Company. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>At this early stage, I can say that
our fundamental views and goals are aligned with those of Strongbow Capital, at least to
the extent that we are strongly committed to improving our top and bottom line results,
optimizing cost efficiencies, and implementing appropriate corporate governance
practices. We are always open to new insights and perspectives on how to improve our
strategic positioning and operating effectiveness. In this regard, Mr. French
acknowledged in his letter that he does not have all of the answers but encouraged us to
retain a consultant to take a fresh look at these important matters. I can report today
that the capabilities of various business advisory firms for this purpose have been under
evaluation since June of this year. At our Board meeting last Thursday, this search was
narrowed to a single candidate, and the Board authorized management to engage this
leading business advisory firm once suitable terms of a working relationship are agreed
upon. After we have engaged this business advisory firm, they will do a strategic and
operational review of our company. After they have completed their analysis, they will
work with the Board and management to develop a revised business plan. The significant
elements of our revised business plan will, of course, be communicated to all
stockholders. Our Board, management and other advisors will also examine other means of
enhancing stockholder value in the coming months. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>While we are open to change and new
ideas, I do not mean to suggest that the Board and management have been anything less
than vigilant and proactive in seeking to improve the Company&#146;s performance. We are proud
of the fact that Duckwall-ALCO&#146;s common stock has more than tripled in price since the
beginning of January 2001, compared with a 6% decline in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. This has occurred in the midst of a difficult economy for retailers,
particularly in the small communities where our stores are located. Competitive pressures
are a continuing challenge. However, we believe our business plan and operating
philosophy are sound and will benefit shareholder value further in the future. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Mr. French has suggested that his
agenda may include a forced sale of the Company. Our current view is that this would be
an inopportune near-term alternative that would prevent our shareholders from fully
realizing the long-term potential of their investment in Duckwall-ALCO Stores, Inc.
However, we are fully aware of our fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and will
consider in good faith and with due care all credible proposals presented to us, so that
we may pursue with vigor such alternatives as are in the best interests of our
stockholders. One of those alternatives, of course, foresees the continuation of
Duckwall-ALCO Stores as an independent company under the direction of its current
management and Board of Directors. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>We also place great value on our

performance. </FONT></P>
