       Carreker Corporation Reports Second Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results
                         and Refines Q3 2004 Guidance

    DALLAS, Aug. 31 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Carreker Corporation
(Nasdaq: CANI), a leading provider of payments technology and consulting
solutions for the financial services industry, today reports its second
quarter results.  For the quarter-ended July 31, 2004, the Company reports
revenues of $29.6 million, net income of $199,000 and diluted earnings per
share of $0.01.

    Comparison of Q2 2004 vs. Q1 2004

    Second quarter 2004 revenue was $29.6 million as compared to the first
quarter 2004 revenue of $29.8 million.  While revenue in total was essentially
flat, the Company did experience an increase in both software implementation
and consulting revenue.  Both the Revenue Enhancement ("RevE") consulting
business segment and the Global Payments Consulting ("GPC") business segment
experienced revenue increases from the prior quarter.  Offsetting the
aforementioned increases were declines in both software license and
maintenance revenue, primarily within the Global Payments Technology ("GPT")
business segment.  However, the addition of a number of significant new
contracts in GPT in Q2 resulted in the strongest quarterly sales to date of
software and services in that segment, with the resulting revenue being
recognized during the balance of 2004 and 2005.  The decline in license fees
in Q2 2004 from the prior quarter is primarily due to a large sale of a
license for our Check Image Archive product, which generated $2.9 million of
revenue during Q1. Maintenance revenue declined in Q2 versus Q1 primarily due
to the timing of cash receipts on maintenance contracts.  The Company's first
fiscal quarter typically reflects increased maintenance revenue in association
with payments on calendar year maintenance contract renewals. Gross margin in
Q2 2004 was 51% versus 52% in the prior quarter.

    Second quarter 2004 operating income of $631,000 compares favorably to the
$1.2 million operating loss during the first quarter 2004 primarily because of
a $1.7 million litigation-related charge recorded in Q1. The second quarter
included two notable items that impacted the quarter:  a $1.2 million benefit
associated with a change in estimate related to a reserve for a discontinued
product and $1.2 million of litigation costs associated with now settled
litigation.

    Comparison of Q2 2004 vs. Q2 2003

    The second quarter 2004 revenue of $29.6 million declined approximately
18% from the second quarter 2003.  The decrease primarily occurred in software
license, maintenance, and implementation fees.  Soft sales in Q4 2003 and Q1
2004 and the timing of maintenance collections contributed to the decline in
revenue.  Additionally, Q2 2003 revenue was unusually high as the Company was
able to recognize maintenance revenue that previously had not been recognized
in Q4 2002 and Q1 2003 as some banks delayed cash payments for their
maintenance renewals pending the completion of the Company's restatement.
Consulting revenue increased in Q2 2004 and served to partially offset the
decline in total revenue.  Second quarter 2004's gross margin of 51% was below
the 55% in Q2 2003 due to lower revenue in Q2 2004.

    Second quarter 2004 operating income of $631,000 was significantly below
the $4.3 million operating income in the second quarter 2003 mainly due to the
higher Q2 2003 revenues as noted above.  This decline in operating income was
partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses.  Operating expenses were
$1.1 million lower in Q2 2004 than Q2 2003 primarily as a result of lower
personnel costs, a reduction in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
approximating $200,000 and lower restructuring charges.  Second quarter 2004
operating expenses included both the previously mentioned $1.2 million of
litigation costs associated with now settled litigation and the $1.2 million
benefit resulting from the change in estimated reserves related to a
discontinued product.

    Guidance

    As you may recall, in the fourth quarter 2003 and the first quarter 2004
earnings conference calls we indicated that the timing of bank decisions,
relative to Check 21, was generally 1 to 2 quarters later than our initial
assumption.  While it does appear that the decision process is picking up as
reflected in our record sales contracts in GPT in Q2, the revenue impact will
not be visible until later 2004 or early 2005 due to our revenue recognition
policies surrounding the significant number of new products to become
Generally Available or GA in Q3, Q4 of 2004 and Q1 2005.

    We continue to feel confident regarding the market and demand for products
and services in our space.  Consistent with our prior guidance, we believe
that we are still on track for attractive revenue growth in late 2004 or early
2005.  While we expect continued strength in contracted sales in Q3 and
beyond, we expect revenues for Q3 to remain relatively flat and operating
profits to be approximately break-even or slightly negative due to the effect
of soft sales in Q4 2003 and Q1 2004, delays in implementation schedules by
our Check 21 clients, increases in non-capitalized R&D expense associated with
new product opportunities, and expansion of our Global Payments Consulting
business segment.  Q4's outlook will be very sensitive to the volume and
timing of sales, product delivery, and client implementation schedules.

    "Although our second quarter profitability was not at desired levels, the
record sales contracts achieved in our GPT business during the quarter is an
indication that we are gaining momentum," said J.D. (Denny) Carreker, Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer of Carreker Corporation. "We are positioning
ourselves to take full advantage of the present and continuing opportunities
afforded by recent regulatory changes as well as revenue growth pressures
challenging our clients and expect to realize associated revenue growth from
these changes in late 2004 or 2005."
