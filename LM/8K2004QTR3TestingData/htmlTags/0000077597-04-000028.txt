SPARTECH CORPORATION
THIRD QUARTER FISCAL 2004 RESULTS & QUARTERLY DIVIDEND
ADD 1


                       SPARTECH CORPORATION ANNOUNCES

      THIRD QUARTER FISCAL 2004 RESULTS AND DECLARES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND


     ST. LOUIS, September 2, 2004 - Spartech Corporation (NYSE:SEH)
announced today increases in both sales and earnings for its third quarter
which ended July 31, 2004.

     Spartech's Chairman, President and CEO, Bradley B. Buechler, reported
that sales for the Company's fiscal third quarter were $288.0 million, an
increase of 21% from the $238.9 million reported in the third quarter of last
year.  The Company's fiscal 2004 third quarter operating earnings were $24.9
million or 29% greater than the $19.3 million reported for the same three
month period last year.  Third quarter 2004 net earnings were $11.7 million,
or $0.36 per diluted share, compared to the $8.1 million, or $0.28 per
diluted share, reported in 2003.

     Commenting on the results, Mr. Buechler stated, "Our consolidated sales
volume for the third quarter was exceptionally strong. Excellent internal
growth of 15% resulted in more than 350 million pounds being shipped during
the period.20% greater than last years' similar quarter.  Operating Earnings
Per Pound Shipped - one of our key economic performance indicators - also
recorded a solid increase during the third quarter as our conversion cost
containment efforts assisted us in moving this measure to 7.1 cents per
pound shipped as compared to the 6.6 cents per pound shipped in the third
quarter of fiscal 2003."

SEGMENT RESULTS

Custom Sheet & Rollstock - Our Custom Sheet & Rollstock group, which
represents approximately two-thirds of the Company's consolidated sales saw
volume (in pounds) increase by 30% in the third quarter of fiscal 2004.  The
majority (20%) came from strong internal growth in primarily the packaging,
appliance and building & construction markets.  Our fourth quarter 2003
acquisition of TriEnda's sheet extrusion operation, along with price/mix
changes made up the balance of the increase in sales dollars.  The segment's
operating margin improved modestly during this year's third quarter.advancing
to 11.2 cents per pound from 11.0 cents per pound last year.as unprecedented
raw material price increases offset most of the group's benefits from
conversion cost reductions and its strong capacity
utilization rate (approximately 90%).

ADD 2


     Color & Specialty Compounds - Sales volume for the Company's Color &
     Specialty Compounds group rose by 11% in the third quarter, with strong
     increases coming from three of the five major markets served by this
     segment.packaging, transportation and appliance.  Operating earnings
     per pound shipped also generated a double-digit increase
     (18%).advancing from 3.4 cents per pound last year to 4.0 cents per
     pound in the third quarter of this year.as the group rebounded from an
     extremely soft third quarter in 2003.  The group's recent positive
     trend in internal growth over the past two quarters gives us
     encouragement that once the current resin market stabilizes or prices
     roll back to more reasonable levels, our traditional operating margins
     for this group will return.

     Molded & Profile Products -The Company's Molded & Profile Products
     segment generated modest sales and earnings increases, in the 5-6%
     range, during the third quarter.  However, current plans call for some
     operational realignments in the group over the next 6-12 months, which
     should result in an improved performance by this segment in fiscal
     2005.

Mr.Buechler added, "We expect strong demand in the fourth quarter to
continue to produce solid sales growth, currently estimated at 8-10% over
the prior year period.  Despite this strong demand, volatile crude oil
prices have resulted in increasing raw material costs that could continue to
put pressure on material margins.  Factoring in these favorable sales trends
and the raw material price volatility, our current guidance for fiscal 2004
is a range of $1.33 to $1.38 earnings per fully diluted share.  Our
management team is very positive about the long-term outlook for our
Company, considering.(1) the positive trend in our internal volume growth
rate (8%) during the past 12 months; (2) the ongoing implementation of our
lean manufacturing effort; (3) our senior management realignment in March
positioning us for the Company's next chapter of growth; (4) the opening of
our new Product Development Center in June; and (5) the increased number of
solid expansion opportunities, both domestic (such as our recently announced
agreement to purchase three divisions of VPI) and now global as well.we
believe our Company is strategically positioned for some sustainable growth
over the next several years."
