      EBITDA is presented because management believes that EBITDA is a useful
supplement to net income and other measurements under accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States since it is a meaningful measure of a
company's performance and ability to meet its future debt service requirements,
fund capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. EBITDA is not a
measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States and should not be considered as an alternative to (i) net
income (or any other measure of performance under generally accepted accounting
principles) as a measure of performance or (ii) cash flows from operating,
investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure
of liquidity. The following table reconciles reported net income to EBITDA:
