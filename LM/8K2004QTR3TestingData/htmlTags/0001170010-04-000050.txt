                      CARMAX REPORTS SECOND QUARTER SALES;
                      ------------------------------------

              Expects Second Quarter EPS of Approximately 27 Cents
              ----------------------------------------------------

Richmond, Va., September 8, 2004 - CarMax, Inc. (NYSE: KMX) today reported sales
for the second quarter ended August 31, 2004.

o  Total sales rose 7% to $1.32 billion from $1.24 billion in the same period
   last year.

o  Total used unit sales rose 4% for the quarter.

o  Comparable store used unit sales declined 7% for the quarter.

o  The company now expects second quarter earnings of approximately 27 cents per
   share.

Sales Commentary
- ----------------

"We continue to be reassured by the fact that our stores are executing well in a
difficult sales environment," said Austin Ligon, president and chief executive
officer. "The sales volatility and weakness that we experienced in June and
July, and especially in early August, continued through the end of the quarter.
August results also suffered from the effects of tropical storms on our Florida
and mid-Atlantic stores. Nonetheless, we remain confident that our superior
consumer offer is allowing us to maintain or gain used car market share."


Addition of Subprime Finance Provider
- -------------------------------------

During the second quarter, CarMax added a new third-party finance provider
focused on subprime customers, Drive Financial Services. Drive was rolled out to
CarMax's entire used car superstore base during the first half of August,
following more than nine months of testing in selected stores. At CarMax,
customers who have been turned down by all of the other in-store finance
providers may qualify for Drive financing. Drive offers financing to customers
within carefully constructed parameters, including vehicle price, year, make,
and mileage; payment-to-income ratios; and minimum down payments. As is
customary in the subprime finance industry, Drive purchases the loan contracts
at a discount.

For the second quarter, used car sales financed by Drive had a modest effect on
overall sales, given the timing of the rollout. "We believe Drive represents an
opportunity to provide us incremental sales and some incremental profit," said
Ligon. "It is still too early to determine the ultimate incremental sales that
may be provided by Drive, given the time required to build consumer awareness of
this new financing opportunity."

Second Quarter Earnings Expectations
- ------------------------------------

"For the second quarter, we now expect earnings per share of approximately 27
cents," Ligon said. "We plan to offer guidance for our third quarter when we
release our second quarter earnings report on September 20."

Store Openings
- --------------

CarMax opened three superstores during the second quarter, entering the Austin,
Tex., market with a standard superstore and adding satellite superstores in
Winston-Salem, N.C., in the Greensboro market, and in Fayetteville, N.C., in the
Raleigh market. The company has opened six superstores thus far in fiscal 2005
and now plans to add three superstores during the second half of the fiscal
year. The satellite superstore in Ontario in the Los Angeles market that had
been scheduled to open at the end of the fiscal year is now scheduled to open
early in March 2005.
