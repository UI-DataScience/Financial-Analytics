                SYMS CORP REPORTS RESULTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER

Secaucus,  New  Jersey,  September  21, 2004 - Syms Corp  (NYSE:SYM),  a leading
off-price retailer,  announced results today for its second quarter ended August
28, 2004.

For the second quarter ended August 28, 2004, the Company had a net loss of $3.7
million  ($0.25 per share) as compared to a net loss of $4.7 million  ($0.30 per
share) for the  thirteen-week  period  ended  August 30,  2003.  For the 26-week
period ended August 28, 2004, the net loss was $3.7 million ($0.25 per share) as
compared  to a net loss of $6.4  million  ($0.42 per  share) for the  comparable
period last year.

For the second  quarter ended August 28, 2004,  same store sales  increased 0.2%
compared to the same period last year.  For the 26-week  period ended August 28,
2004, same store sales increased 3.7% compared to the same period last year.

Net sales for the second  quarter  decreased  1.4% to $61.3  million,  down from
$62.1  million for the same period last year.  Net sales for the 26-week  period
ended August 28, 2004 increased 3.1% to $129.6  million,  up from $125.6 million
for the same period last year.

The results for the second  quarter  ended  August 28, 2004 reflect a $1,309,000
charge  resulting from the simultaneous  purchase and sale of the  Lawrenceville
store,  which will be closed on October 16,  2004.  This action was taken by the
Company as part of its continuing efforts to improve profitability.

Syms Corp currently operates a chain of thirty eight "off-price"  apparel stores
located  throughout  the  Northeastern  and Middle  Atlantic  regions and in the
Midwest,  Southeast and Southwest. Each Syms store offers a broad range of first
quality,  in-season  merchandise  bearing  nationally  recognized  designer  and
brand-name labels.

(as such term is  defined in the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of

release,  the words "anticipate",  "believe",  "estimate",  "expect",  "intend",
