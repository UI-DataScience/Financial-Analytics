                      SPAR GROUP REPORTS FINANCIAL RESULTS
                             FOR 2004 SECOND QUARTER
             --COMPANY'S OPERATING LOSS REFLECTS NON-CASH CHARGES--


         TARRYTOWN, NY -- AUGUST 20, 2004 -- SPAR Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRP)
today reported financial results for the second quarter and six months ended
June 30, 2004.

         For the 2004 second quarter, the company sustained a net loss of $12.2
million, equal to $0.65 per share, which includes approximately $9.3 million in
non cash expenses ($8.1 million in non-cash impairment charges, and a $1.2
million non-cash charge against net deferred tax assets and tax benefits
recorded in the first quarter of 2004). Net revenues for the 2004 second quarter
amounted to $11.9 million. The company reported net income of $608,000, or $0.03
per diluted share, on net revenues of $17.4 million for the second quarter of
2003.

         For the first six months of 2004, the company posted a net loss of
$13.0 million, or $0.69 per share, on revenues of $24.7 million, compared with
net income of $1.9 million, equal to $0.10 per fully diluted share, on net
revenues of $36.1 million for the corresponding prior year period.

         Robert G. Brown, SPAR Group's chairman and chief executive officer,
said more than 77% of the loss for the second quarter and 68% of the loss for
the six month period was attributable to non-cash, non-recurring items.

         "While we have lost some key business, resulting in part from our
largest customer completing the sale of its business and a major retailer
closing some of its stores and changing some of its merchandising policies to
emerge from bankruptcy, we have taken swift and decisive action in a
restructuring plan aimed at restoring SPAR's financial health by downsizing our
fixed expense structure to reflect our lower revenue base and returning the
company to profitability in 2005," Brown said. "We plan to cut fixed costs, but
not at the expense of the quality of service we provide to our customers. In
addition, we plan to continue investing in technology, local in-store
demonstration services and international expansion. We believe these areas
though currently contributing to our losses, will improve profits in the future.
It is our intent to build a profitable company and add tangible shareholder
value. We are taking steps now to help assure that our long-term objectives will
be met," Brown said.

         SPAR Group, Inc. is a diversified international marketing services
company, providing a broad array of productivity enhancing products and services
to help Fortune 1000 companies improve their sales, operating efficiency and
profits. The company provides in-store merchandising, in-store demonstrations,
technology and research to manufacturers and retailers covering all product
classifications and all classes of trade, including mass market, drug store,
convenience store and grocery chains, throughout the United States and
internationally.


         Certain statements in this news release are forward-looking, including,
but not limited to, the benefits to be derived from the company's restructuring
plan and the ability to return to profitability in 2005. The company's actual
results, performance and trends could differ materially from those indicated or
implied by such statements as a result of various factors, including (without
limitation) the continued strengthening of SPAR's selling and marketing
functions, continued customer satisfaction and contract renewal, new product
development, continued technological superiority over its competitors, continued
availability of capable dedicated personnel, continued cost management, the
success of its international efforts, success and availability of acquisitions,
availability of financing and other factors, as well as by factors applicable to
most companies such as general economic, competitive and other business and
civil conditions. Information respecting certain of these and other factors that
could effect future results, performance or trends are discussed in SPAR Group's
annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other filings
made with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time.
