Operational Discussion

         "While we recorded  record  revenues in the second  quarter,  they were
below our expectations,"  said Richard Thalheimer,  founder,  chairman and chief
executive officer.  "Total Company second quarter revenues were up 20 percent on
top of last year's  second  quarter 24 percent  gain;  catalog/direct  marketing
sales (which  includes TV  infomercial  and wholesale  sales) were up 28 percent
over last year's 11 percent sales  increase;  Internet  sales were up 14 percent
over a huge 47 percent  increase  during last year's second  quarter," noted Mr.
Thalheimer.  "Retail  sales were  affected by less than  anticipated  television
infomercial media availability and higher media rates, producing generally lower
sales,  particularly  during the  second-half of July's  election-related  media
spending.  Gross  margin  was  also  adversely  impacted  by  approximately  one
percentage  point by a small sales  channel shift this quarter from retail sales
to wholesale sales," Mr. Thalheimer stated.

         "In the second  quarter we opened ten new  stores,  increasing  the new
stores opened fiscal  year-to-date to 15. We expect to achieve our goal of 15 to
20 percent new store unit growth,  with a plan to open 26 new stores during this

<PAGE>

fiscal year. We plan to continue with our goal of new store openings of 15 to 20
percent unit growth for the next fiscal year," Mr.  Thalheimer  further  stated.
"We continue to have good new product  introductions and we are confident of the
strength of our multichannel sales strategy.

         "Our  guidance  for the  third  quarter  is a net loss in the  range of
$(0.08) to $(0.11) per  diluted  share.  This  compares  with last year's  third
quarter earnings of $0.06 per diluted share.  This guidance is based on lowering
sales for the third quarter  relating to softer than expected sales in the first
half of August. With the current guidance,  it is also prudent to lower our full
year earnings per share guidance to $1.65 to $1.69 per diluted share, a decrease
from our previous full year guidance of $1.83 to $1.87 per diluted  share.  This
compares to last  year's  $1.65 per diluted  share," Mr.  Thalheimer  concluded.
