On September 15, 2004, Ferro Corporation issued a press release announcing the completion of its investigation related to the recent discovery of inappropriate accounting entries in its Polymer Additives business. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

<FONT SIZE="2">
On September 14, 2004, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors along with senior management of Ferro Corporation (the "Company") concluded that the financial statements issued for 2002, 2003 and the first quarter 2004 should no longer be relied upon and would be restated.<br><br>On July 23, 2004, the Company announced in a press release that its Polymer Additives business performance in the second quarter fell short of expectations, affecting Company earnings by approximately $0.12 per share. The Company also announced at that time it expected to take a $0.10 per share non-cash charge to earnings, or approximately $4.5 million after tax, as a result of inappropriate accounting entries (which included both irregular accounting entries and accounting mistakes) that had been uncovered by the Company during its financial review process. <br><br>Independent legal counsel and independent auditors (not Ferro's external auditors KPMG, LLP) conducted a thorough investigation, under the auspices of the Company&#
146;s Audit Committee, related to the inappropriate accounting entries.  In a September 15, 2004 press release, the Company announced the independent investigation was complete and that it generally confirmed the previously announced findings.  A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.<br><br>The investigation found inappropriate accounting entries in the nature of potentially irregular entries totaling approximately $3.6 million before tax ($2.2 million after tax) for the Company&#146;s fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003, and the first quarter of 2004.  The investigation concluded that all of the potentially irregular accounting entries were made in the Company&#146;s Polymer Additives business unit and without any knowledge or involvement of senior management.   Substantially all of the potential irregular entries were made by a subordinate divisional employee who has since left the Company.  The majority of these entries involved the overstatement of certain asset accounts and the un
derstatement of certain liabilities, resulting in the understatement of cost of sales.<br><br>The investigation also found during the same periods inappropriate accounting entries in the nature of mistakes amounting to $6.8 million before tax ($4.2 million after tax).  The mistakes primarily resulted from oversight or misuse of facts that existed at the time a given set of financial statements was prepared.  These included, for example, mistakes in the estimation of certain inventory reserves and raw material price variances, as well as failure to properly reconcile certain inventory and related liability accounts.  Generally, cost of sales was understated due to these mistakes.<br><br>Based on these investigation findings and after consultation with its external auditors, KPMG LLP, on September 14, 2004, the Company&#146;s Audit Committee accepted management&#146;s recommendation to restate the Company&#146;s financial statements for fiscal years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003 and for fiscal quarter ended
 March 31, 2004.  This recommendation was made despite the fact that various quantitative and qualitative factors considered by management suggested that the adjustments for the inappropriate accounting entries might not be material to the Company&#146;s financial statements for some of the periods considered.  Nonetheless, the Company will file an amended 2003 Form 10-K and an amended Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2004 as soon as practicable.<br><br>The Company and its Audit Committee advised its external auditors, KPMG LLP, of its findings and is working with KPMG to evaluate the effect of the investigation findings on current and prior period financial statements.  Pending completion of the restatement process, it is possible that additional adjustments of the current and prior period financial results could be identified.<br><br>

<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt"><FONT style="font-size=12pt"><B>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</B></FONT>


<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><FONT style="font-size=13pt"><B>Ferro Corporation Completes Investigation<BR>
and Confirms Findings</B></FONT>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 13pt"><FONT style="font-size=12pt">CLEVELAND, Ohio &#150; September&nbsp;15, 2004 &#150; Ferro Corporation (NYSE:FOE) today announced the
completion of its investigation and confirmed its findings related to the recent discovery of
inappropriate accounting entries in its Polymer Additives business.</FONT>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Ferro announced in a July&nbsp;23, 2004 press release that its Polymer Additives business performance in
the second quarter fell short of expectations, affecting Company earnings by approximately $0.12
per share. The Company also announced at that time it expected to take a $0.10 per share non-cash
charge to earnings, or approximately $4.5&nbsp;million after tax, related to inappropriate accounting
entries (which included both irregular accounting entries and accounting mistakes) that had been
uncovered by the Company during its financial review process.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">A thorough investigation, conducted by independent legal counsel and independent auditors under the
auspices of the Company&#146;s Audit Committee, has now generally confirmed the findings reported in the
July&nbsp;23, 2004 press release. The investigation concluded that all of the potentially irregular
accounting entries were made in the Polymer Additives business unit and without any knowledge or
involvement of senior management. Substantially all of the irregular entries were made by a
subordinate divisional employee who has since left the Company.</FONT><FONT style="font-size=9pt"> </FONT><FONT style="font-size=12pt">The final investigation
has resulted in the Company taking an additional estimated non-cash charge of $0.02 per share, or
$0.9&nbsp;million after tax. In addition, certain items that were initially included in the $0.12 per
share second quarter earnings shortfall announced on July&nbsp;23, 2004, have been reclassified as
non-cash charges applicable to prior periods. The amount of such charges is approximately $0.02
per share, or $1.1&nbsp;million after tax. Consequently, the total non-cash charge to earnings will be
slightly less than $0.15 per share, or $6.4&nbsp;million after tax.</FONT>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Chairman and chief executive officer, Hector R. Ortino commented, &#147;We have investigated this matter
thoroughly and have corrected all of the inappropriate accounting entries. We are also instituting
additional protective measures in an effort to prevent similar entries from being made in the
future. In addition, as part of our on-going program to assure the Company&#146;s internal control
systems are in full compliance with applicable internal control requirements, we are evaluating
further enhancements to the overall system of internal controls.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Ferro advised its external auditors, KPMG LLP, of its findings and is working closely with KPMG to
evaluate the effect of the investigation findings on current and prior-period financial statements.
Finally, the Company has voluntarily disclosed its investigation findings to the Securities and
Exchange Commission, agreed to provide the SEC with relevant information concerning the
investigation and agreed to continue cooperating with the SEC in its review of this matter.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">The Company will be filing an amended Form 10-Q for it fiscal quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2004 and an
amended Form 10-K for its fiscal years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and December&nbsp;31, 2002, when it has
completed its review of restated financial results for those periods. The Company will then file
its Form 10-Q for its fiscal quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2004. Ferro has received a technical waiver
from its bank group regarding the delay in providing quarterly financial reporting documents
required under the Company&#146;s revolving credit agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Ortino further commented, &#147;We are pleased to have the investigative process behind us and to have
the investigation findings generally confirm our preliminary assessment of this matter. We will
now focus our full energy going forward on growing our businesses and improving profitability.
Ferro remains a strong Company with good businesses, a solid financial structure and a Leadership
Agenda strategy that is beginning to deliver expected results,&#148; said Mr.&nbsp;Ortino.
