    MEDICIS REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-END FISCAL 2004 FINANCIAL RESULTS

SCOTTSDALE,  Arizona--August 24, 2004--Medicis (NYSE:MRX) today announced fourth
quarter  fiscal 2004 net revenue  growth of  approximately  32% to $88.0 million
with "if-converted" net income of $24.5 million, or $0.37 per diluted share. The
Company reported Generally Accepted  Accounting  Principles  ("GAAP") net income
for the fourth quarter fiscal 2004 of $23.7 million. Included in net income is a
tax-effected loss of approximately  $249,000 associated with the loss on sale of
certain  product  rights.  The Company  reported  fourth quarter fiscal 2003 net
revenues of $66.7 million with net income of $17.1 million, or $0.30 per diluted
share,  absent a $3.3 million  tax-effected  special charge  reported during the
fourth  quarter  of fiscal  2003  associated  with a  research  and  development
collaboration.  Including the $3.3 million  tax-effected special charge reported
during the fourth  quarter of fiscal 2003,  Medicis  reported GAAP net income of
$13.9 million, or $0.24 per diluted share for fourth quarter fiscal 2003.

For fiscal year 2004,  Medicis reported net revenue growth of approximately  23%
to $303.7 million with  "if-converted" net income of $73.2 million, or $1.13 per
diluted share,  absent a $37.5 million  tax-effected  loss  associated  with the
early  extinguishment  of debt  reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 and
absent a $1.6 million tax-effected special charge associated with a research and
development  collaboration  reported  in the  second  quarter  of  fiscal  2004.
Included  in  net  income  is a  tax-effected  loss  of  approximately  $249,000
associated  with the  loss on sale of  certain  product  rights.  Including  the
special  charges  and the loss on sale of certain  product  rights,  the Company
reported GAAP net income of $30.8 million, or $0.52 per diluted share for fiscal
2004.

Comparatively,  Medicis reported fiscal 2003 net revenues of $247.5 million with
net income of $63.5 million,  or $1.13 per diluted share, absent a $12.2 million
tax-effected special charge reported during fiscal 2003 associated with research
and development  collaborations.  Including the  tax-effected  special charge of
$12.2 million  reported during fiscal 2003, the Company reported GAAP net income
of $51.3 million, or $0.91 per diluted share for fiscal 2003.

Fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2004 diluted per share amounts are calculated
using the "if-converted" method of accounting in accordance with GAAP due to the
outstanding 2.5%  Convertible  Senior Notes meeting the criteria for conversion,
regardless of whether the bondholders  actually convert their bonds into shares.
For  the  year  ended  June  30,  2004,  the  dilutive  shares  relative  to the
convertible   notes  do  not  impact  GAAP  earnings  per  share,  as  they  are
anti-dilutive. Fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2003 diluted per share amounts
do not reflect the "if-converted" method, as the criteria for conversion had not
been met.

"We are pleased to announce the  completion of the strongest  quarter and fiscal
year  in the  Company's  history,"  said  Jonah  Shacknai,  Chairman  and  Chief
Executive  Officer of  Medicis.  "Fiscal  2004 was another  noteworthy  year for
Medicis, with several significant milestone achievements,  including exceptional
sales growth through the launch of RESTYLANE(R),  exceeding $125 million in cash
flow from  operations,  surpassing  $80 million in  revenues  for the first time
during one quarter,  and accumulating  over $1 billion in assets. We express our
gratitude to the physicians and the  exceptional  Medicis team for their support
as we continue our expansion  into the  aesthetics  market and remain focused on
our commitment to increasing shareholder value in fiscal 2005."

Fiscal 2004 year-end net revenues  increased  approximately  23%, primarily as a
result of overall  growth in sales of  RESTYLANE(R),  DYNACIN(R),  LOPROX(R) and
TRIAZ(R).  At the end of the fourth quarter,  the Company's core brands included
DYNACIN(R),  LOPROX(R), OMNICEF(R),  PLEXION(R),  RESTYLANE(R) and TRIAZ(R). For
fiscal 2004, core brands, including ORAPRED(R), represented approximately 87% of
total  product  sales.  During fiscal 2004,  prescription  volume growth for the
Company's core brands, excluding RESTYLANE(R),  increased 15% and 13% in new and
total  prescriptions,  respectively.  The  Company's  gross  profit  margin  was
approximately 85% for the fiscal 2004 year-end.

For the fourth quarter fiscal 2004, cash flow from operations was $50.5 million,
compared  to  $16.0  million  for the  fourth  quarter  fiscal  2003,  or a 215%
increase. During fourth quarter fiscal 2004, selling, general and administrative
expenses  decreased  approximately  1 percentage  point as a percentage of sales
compared to fourth quarter fiscal 2003,  increasing  approximately 27% in fourth
quarter  fiscal  2004 to $30.3  million,  compared  to $23.9  million for fourth
quarter fiscal 2003.

Cash flow from operations for fiscal 2004 was $128.0 million,  compared to $84.7
million for fiscal 2003, or a 51% increase.  Selling, general and administrative
expenses  for  fiscal  2004  increased  approximately  29%  to  $118.3  million,
primarily due to the  incremental  costs  incurred  with the product  launch and
first U.S.  commercial  sales of  RESTYLANE(R),  which began on January 6, 2004.
Such incremental costs associated with the product launch included the hiring of
a dedicated aesthetics sales force, additional headquarters personnel to support
sales force efforts, including product management, customer service and training
personnel,  expenses  associated with public relations,  physician  training and
continuing medical education, and other administrative expenses.

During fiscal 2004,  research and development  expense,  absent special charges,
increased  approximately 50% to $14.1 million for the year, primarily due to the
advancement of the Company's research and development pipeline. Depreciation and
amortization  expense  for  fiscal  2004  increased  approximately  66% to $16.8
million,  primarily  due to the  amortization  of the  purchase  price  for  the
exclusive rights to RESTYLANE(R) in the United States and Canada.

The Company's previously released fiscal year 2005 revenue and earnings guidance
remains unchanged and is as follows:  fiscal year 2005 revenues of approximately
$365 million and  earnings  per share  guidance of  approximately  $1.42;  first
quarter  fiscal year 2005 (for the quarter  ending  September  30, 2004) revenue
guidance  of  approximately  $85  million  and  earnings  per share  guidance of
approximately  $0.29;  second  quarter  fiscal year 2005 (for the quarter ending
December 31, 2004) revenue  guidance of  approximately  $89 million and earnings
per share guidance of  approximately  $0.35;  third quarter fiscal 2005 (for the
quarter ending March 31, 2005) revenue guidance of approximately $93 million and
earnings per share guidance of  approximately  $0.36;  and fourth quarter fiscal
year  2005  (for  the  quarter  ending  June  30,  2005)  revenue   guidance  of
approximately  $98  million and  earnings  per share  guidance of  approximately
$0.42. At the time of this  disclosure,  Medicis  believes these  objectives are
attainable  based upon  information  currently  available  to the  Company.  The
Company's business is subject to all risk factors outlined in the Company's most
recent annual report on Form 10-K, its Form S-3 registration statement and other
filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission. At the time of this
release, the Company cannot, among other things, assess the forthcoming results

                                     (more)
<PAGE>

of the Company's research and development projects and the risks associated with
the FDA approval process,  risks associated with significant  competition within
the Company's industry,  risks associated with changes in laws, risks related to
general economic conditions,  including interest rate fluctuations,  nor can the
Company  validate  its  assumptions  of the full  impact on its  business of the
approval of competitive  generic  versions of the Company's core brands,  or any
future  competitive  product  approvals  that may affect the  Company's  brands.
Additionally,  Medicis may acquire and/or license products or technologies  from
third  parties to enter into new  strategic  markets.  The Company  periodically
makes  up-front,  non-refundable  payments  to third  parties for  research  and
development  work which has been  completed and  periodically  makes  additional
non-refundable payments for the achievement of various milestones.  There can be
no certainty  which periods these  potential  payments  could be made, or if any
payments such as these will be made at all. The stated estimated future guidance
does not include the potential payments associated with any such transactions.

Medicis  is the  leading  independent  specialty  pharmaceutical  company in the
United  States  focusing  primarily  on  the  treatment  of  dermatological  and
podiatric  conditions  and  aesthetics  medicine.  Medicis has  leading  branded
prescription  products in a number of therapeutic  categories,  including  acne,
eczema, fungal infections,  psoriasis,  rosacea,  seborrheic dermatitis and skin
and  skin-structure   infections.   The  Company's  products  have  earned  wide
acceptance by both physicians and patients due to their clinical  effectiveness,
high quality and cosmetic elegance.

The Company's products include the prescription brands RESTYLANE(R),  DYNACIN(R)
(minocycline HCl), LOPROX(R)  (ciclopirox),  OMNICEF(R)  (cefdinir),  PLEXION(R)
(sodium    sulfacetamide/sulfur),    TRIAZ(R)   (benzoyl   peroxide),   LIDEX(R)
(fluocinonide),  and SYNALAR(R) (fluocinolone  acetonide),  the over-the-counter
brand  ESOTERICA(R),  and BUPHENYL(R)  (sodium  phenylbutyrate),  a prescription

Except for historical information,  this press release includes "forward-looking
statements"  within the meaning of the  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act.  All
statements  included in this press  release that address  activities,  events or
developments that Medicis expects,  believes or anticipates will or may occur in
the future are  forward-looking  statements.  This includes earnings  estimates,
future  financial  performance and other matters.  These statements are based on
certain  assumptions  made by Medicis based on its  experience and perception of
historical trends,  current  conditions,  expected future developments and other
factors it believes are  appropriate in the  circumstances.  Such statements are
subject to a number of assumptions,  risks and uncertainties,  many of which are
beyond the control of Medicis.  Any such  projections or statements  include the
current   views  of  Medicis  with  respect  to  future   events  and  financial
performance.  No assurances can be given,  however, that these events will occur
or that such results will be achieved.  Medicis cannot  validate its assumptions
of the full  impact on its  business  of the  approval  of  competitive  generic
versions of its core brands,  including DYNACIN(R) Tablets and/or LOPROX(R),  or
any future competitive product approvals that may affect its brands. Also, there
are a number of additional  important factors that could cause actual results to
differ  materially from those  projected,  including the anticipated size of the
markets,  the availability of product supply, the receipt of required regulatory
approvals,  the ability to realize  anticipated  synergies  and  benefits of the
Q-Med  transactions,  the  risks  and  uncertainties  normally  incident  to the
pharmaceutical industry, dependence on sales of key products, the uncertainty of
future financial  results and fluctuations in operating  results,  dependence on
Medicis'  strategy  including the  uncertainty of license  payments and/or other
payments  due  from  third  parties,  the  timing  and  success  of new  product
development by Medicis or third  parties,  product  introductions,  the risks of
pending or future  litigation,  and other risks  described  from time to time in
Medicis' SEC filings including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
June 30, 2003.  There can be no assurance as to when or if any of the holders of
the Notes will have the right to convert or if the Notes will be converted,  and
what impact the increase in the number of shares outstanding will have on its

                                     (more)

results of  operations.  Forward-looking  statements  represent  the judgment of
Medicis'  management as of the date of this release,  and Medicis  disclaims any
intent or obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
