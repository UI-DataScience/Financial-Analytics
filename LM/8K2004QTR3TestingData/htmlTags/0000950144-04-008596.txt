              BELK, INC. REPORTS 67 PERCENT INCREASE IN NET INCOME
                  FOR SECOND QUARTER; SALES INCREASE 9 PERCENT


CHARLOTTE, N.C., August 25, 2004 -- Belk, Inc. today announced operating results
for the second quarter and first six months ended July 31, 2004:

NET INCOME

Net income for the 13-week period increased $6.0 million, or 67.4 percent, over
the same prior-year period to $14.9 million. The increase was primarily the
result of improvements in sales, operating margin and expense control during the
period. Net income excluding non-comparable items increased $6.6 million to
$15.0 million. A detailed reconciliation of net income to net income excluding
non-comparable items is provided at the end of this release.

Net income for the first six months increased $15.6 million, or 67.8 percent, to
$38.6 million, compared to the same prior-year period. Net income excluding
non-comparable items increased $16.5 million to $39.0 million.

SALES

Total second quarter sales increased $44.3 million, or 9.0 percent, to $536.4
million from $492.1 million for the same prior-year period. The sales increase
resulted primarily from a 4.9 percent increase in comparable store sales plus
$21.8 million in additional sales for the period generated from new stores. Top
performing merchandise areas for the period included home store, accessories,
women's sportswear and men's sportswear. The company also had strong sales of
private label merchandise across all categories.

Total sales for the first six months ended July 31, 2004 increased $91.7
million, or 9.2 percent, to $1,086.5 million, compared to the same prior-year
period. The sales increase resulted primarily from a 5.3 percent increase in
comparable store sales and additional sales from new stores of $44.4 million for
the 26-week period.

THOMAS M. "TIM" BELK, JR., chairman and chief executive officer of Belk, Inc.,
said, "Effective execution of spring merchandising initiatives enabled Belk to
take advantage of the upswing in consumer demand and realize outstanding comp
store sales gains and gross margin results for the period. Expense management
also contributed to our positive results. We're pleased with the performance
that was made possible by the exemplary efforts of our management and associate
team."

ABOUT BELK, INC.

Charlotte, N.C.-based Belk, Inc. is the nation's largest privately owned
department store company with 225 stores in 14 Southeastern states. Founder
William Henry Belk opened the company's first store in Monroe, N.C., in 1888.

NOTES:

- -        To provide clarity in measuring Belk's financial performance, Belk
         supplements the reporting of its consolidated financial information
         under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with the non-GAAP
         financial measure of "net income excluding non-comparable items". Belk
         believes that "net income excluding non-comparable items" is a
         financial measure that emphasizes the company's core ongoing operations
         and enables investors to focus on period-over-period operating
         performance. It is among the primary indicators Belk uses in planning
         and operating the business and forecasting future periods, and Belk
         believes this measure is an important indicator of recurring operations
         because it excludes items that may not be indicative of or are
         unrelated to core operating results. Belk also excludes such items in
         connection with evaluating company performance in connection with its
         incentive compensation plans. In addition, this measure provides a
         better baseline for modeling future earnings expectations and makes it
         easier to compare Belk's results with other companies that operate in
         the same industry. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP
         measure. The non-GAAP measure of "net income excluding non-comparable
         items" should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for
         GAAP net income.
