                     SCHAWK, INC. ANNOUNCES IMPROVED OUTLOOK
                         FOR THIRD QUARTER AND FULL YEAR

          o  Net sales and earnings expected to be a record for third-quarter
             and nine-month year-to-date periods
          o  Increased sales from acquisitions, new account wins and increased
             business with existing accounts
          o  Earnings per share for the quarter estimated at a record $0.26 to
             $0.28 per fully diluted share

DES PLAINES, IL, SEPTEMBER 17, 2004--SCHAWK, INC. (NYSE: SGK), one of North
America's leading providers of digital imaging graphics services to the consumer
products industry, today announced that, based on preliminary results, it
anticipates significantly improved results for the third quarter and full year
2004 as compared to previous period results.

THIRD QUARTER 2004 OUTLOOK
Commenting on the preliminary results from the quarter, President and Chief
Executive Officer David A. Schawk noted, "We expect to announce record results
in net sales and profits for the three-month and nine-month periods ended
September 30 when we report final results on Tuesday, October 26. Net sales for
the third quarter are anticipated to be in the range of $59 to $61 million, and
our earnings per share are anticipated to be in the range of $0.26 to $0.28
cents per fully diluted share."

As points of reference, in the prior-year third quarter, net sales were $50.5
million and earnings per share were $0.20 per fully diluted share.

Mr. Schawk continued, "This is the second consecutive quarter in which we have
made an early announcement of improved results. The upward trend in sales that
began in March continues to drive strong sales for Schawk. Our ability to help
our existing clients quickly bring their new products to market has enabled them
to capitalize on rapidly changing consumer and retailer demands. In addition,
our three acquisitions at year-end 2003 also contributed to increased sales
during the quarter. Finally, a number of new client wins over the past several
months has started to make a significant impact on revenues, as these accounts
utilize Schawk's broad array of services."

share for the period in the range of $0.90 to $0.94 per share, compared to $0.78

preliminary results from the third quarter and first nine months of 2004."
