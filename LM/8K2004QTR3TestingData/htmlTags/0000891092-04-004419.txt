ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

      On September 13, 2004, Vermont Pure Holdings, Ltd. issued the press
release attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. The press
release includes the non-GAAP financial measure of EBITDA which represents
earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is
included because management believes it is a useful tool for investors to assess
the operating performance of the business in comparison to other businesses in
the industry. In addition, EBITDA is a measure used to calculate one of the
financial covenants for compliance with the Company's senior debt facility.
Management believes that the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is
net income.

 Vermont Pure Holdings, Ltd. Announces Results for Three and Nine Months Ended
                                 July 31, 2004

    WILLISTON, Vt., Sept. 13 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Vermont Pure Holdings,
Ltd. announced today that it will file its results for the three and nine
month fiscal periods ending July 31, 2004 on Form 10-Q with the Security and
Exchange Commission and will hold its quarterly conference call tomorrow.

    Sales for the third quarter ended July 31, 2004 increased 2% to $13.6
million from $13.4 during the same period in 2003.  Sales for the nine months
ended July 31, 2004 increased 5% to $38.7 million from $36.8 million for the
same period in 2003.  The increase in sales was attributable to the
integration of recent acquisitions into the base business.

    Income from continuing operations was $390,000 for the fiscal third
quarter of 2004 versus $420,000 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003.
Income from continuing operations was $256,000 for the first nine months of
the current fiscal year compared to $859,000 in the first nine months of
fiscal year 2003.  The decrease in both periods was attributable to lower
gross profit due to lower selling prices, a shift toward increased sales of
lower margin products, and higher transportation, fuel, and insurance costs
for the period.

    Net income, including income from discontinued operations, for the three
months ended July 31, 2004 was $390,000, or $.02 per share, compared to net
income of $566,000, or $.03 per share for the corresponding period in 2003.
For the nine months ended July 31, 2004, net income was $416,000, or $.02 per
share, compared to $1.2 million, or $.05 per share for the corresponding
period in 2003.  Net income for the nine months of 2004 included a gain on the
sale of the retail segments of business, before taxes, of $353,000.

    Tomorrow's conference call will start at 10:00 A.M. (Eastern Time) and run
approximately one hour.  The conference can be attended by telephone by
