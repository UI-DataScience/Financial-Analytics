AFC ENTERPRISES RELEASES MID-QUARTER BUSINESS UPDATE FOR THIRD QUARTER 2004


ATLANTA, Sept. 21 -- AFC Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq: AFCE), the franchisor and
operator of Popeyes(R) Chicken & Biscuits, Church's Chicken(TM), Cinnabon(R) and
the franchisor of Seattle's Best Coffee(R) in Hawaii, on military bases and
internationally, today announced operating performance results for the Company's
fiscal period 8, which began July 12, 2004 and ended August 8, 2004, and fiscal
period 9, which began August 9, 2004 and ended September 5, 2004.


Overall Performance


Domestic Same-Store Sales Growth


The Company reported that blended domestic same-store sales growth at its
restaurants, bakeries and cafes were up 1.8 percent in period 8 and up 2.9
percent in period 9 of 2004, compared to down 1.0 percent and down 1.4 percent
for period 8 and period 9 of 2003. Church's domestic same-store sales were up
3.5 percent in period 8 and up 5.8 percent in period 9. Popeyes domestic
same-store sales were up 1.2 percent in period 8 and up 2.0 percent in period 9,
and Cinnabon's domestic same-store sales were down 1.1 percent in period 8 and
down 2.4 percent in period 9.


The Company's average check was up for all brands in both period 8 and period 9
of 2004. Church's average check was up 7.3 percent and 9.1 percent,
respectively, Popeyes average check was also up 5.9 percent and 5.7 percent,
respectively, and Cinnabon was up 5.7 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively.


AFC experienced a year over year decline in the number of transactions in all of
the brands. The Company remains focused on improving this measure by enhancing
overall operational execution, introducing innovative products and promotions,
and developing a more food-focused advertising strategy. Specific actions that
AFC has undertaken include Popeyes new advertising, which returns focus to the
brand's unique flavor profile and new menu offerings, Church's initiation of a
two-tiered value menu program targeted to specific transaction challenged
markets, and Cinnabon's installation of a new product display that better
merchandises the brand's fresh products.

         Domestic system-wide comparable store sales by brand were as follows:

                  of fat along with the Strawberry Frusia, a fat-free blended
