                 ZiLOG LOWERS THIRD QUARTER 2004 EXPECTATIONS


San Jose, CA (September 27, 2004) ZiLOG, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZILG) the creator of
the Z80 microprocessor and a leading innovator of integrated 8 bit
microcontroller solutions, today announced it is lowering its revenue outlook
for the third quarter of 2004. Sales for the third quarter are now expected to
be $23 million compared to earlier guidance of $25.5 million. Demand for the
company's consumer products is trending below previous expectations. The lower
sales reflects lower sell through sales in its Asian distributors and a number
of OEM customers pushing their demand from the third to the fourth quarter. We
believe the lower sales relates to excess inventory at our customers and we
expect it will also impact our fourth quarter and consequently we are cautious
and projecting our fourth quarter sales to be in the $22 million to $23
million range. Additionally, we expect sales for the first quarter of 2005 to
increase as customers increase their order rates and our new products continue
to gain traction.

Total bookings for the third quarter are expected to be approximately $24.5
million including approximately $2 million in embedded flash products. The
company expects sales of its embedded flash products in the third quarter to
be on track with previous estimates of $1 million to $1.5 million. As
previously reported, during the quarter the company closed its 5 inch wafer
manufacturing facility in Nampa, Idaho. Third-quarter gross margin is expected
to be approximately 46 percent as compared to previous expectations of 49 to
49.5 percent reflecting this transition. The company expects to end the third
quarter with cash of approximately $40 million including repayments of $2.4
million in debt and after repurchasing 551,700 shares of stock for $4.3
million in the quarter.

At 1:30 p.m. Pacific (4:30 p.m. Eastern) today, Monday September 27th, 2004,
Jim Thorburn, the company's Chief Executive Officer will conduct a conference
call with analysts, investors and other interested parties. Access to the call
