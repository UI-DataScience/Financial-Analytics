     Dollar General Reports Increase in Second Quarter Net Income

    GOODLETTSVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 26, 2004--Dollar
General Corporation (NYSE:DG) today reported diluted earnings per
share of $0.22 for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to $0.18
per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. Net income for
the quarter increased 19 percent to $71.3 million in 2004 compared to
$59.9 million in 2003. During the quarter, the Company recorded a net
reduction in certain income tax-related liabilities and related
interest accruals which increased net income by $7.4 million.
Excluding these adjustments, net income for the second quarter of 2004
would have been $63.9 million, or $0.19 per share.
    Net sales during the second quarter increased 11.2 percent to
$1.84 billion compared to $1.65 billion in the second quarter of 2003.
The sales increase was driven by new store growth and a same-store
sales increase of 3.2 percent.
    Gross profit during the quarter was $537.0 million, or 29.2
percent of sales, versus $472.8 million, or 28.6 percent of sales, in
the prior year quarter. The improvement in gross margin is primarily
the result of a higher average markup on beginning inventories and a
decrease in lower of cost or market inventory adjustments.
    Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") for the
quarter were $428.9 million, or 23.4 percent of sales, in the current
year, versus $371.0 million, or 22.5 percent of sales, in the prior
year quarter. The increase in SG&A as a percentage to sales is
primarily due to increased rental expense on the Company's leased
facilities, increased costs associated with store physical inventory
counts, increased labor relating to the execution of store layout
changes during the quarter, fees associated with the acceptance of
debit cards, and increased professional fees associated with the
Company's 2004 store work-flow project.
    The Company's effective tax rate was 31.5 percent in the current
year quarter versus 36.2 percent in the comparable prior year period.
The current quarter's provision for income taxes reflects an
adjustment of $6.2 million to reduce certain contingent state
income-tax related liabilities, net of the federal income tax effect.
The Company also reduced the interest accrual relating to these
contingent liabilities by $2.0 million. Excluding these adjustments,
the Company's effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2004 would
have been 37.5 percent. This rate is higher than the Company's tax
rate in the prior year period due in part to the expiration of certain
federal jobs tax credits.
    For the 26-week year-to-date period, net income was $139.2 million
in fiscal 2004, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to $120.3
million, or $0.36 per diluted share, in the comparable prior year
period. Excluding the effect of the income tax-related adjustments
described above, net income for the 26-week period would have been
$131.7 million, or $0.39 per diluted share.
    Year-to-date net sales increased 11.3 percent, including a
same-store sales increase of 3.1 percent. As a percentage to sales,
gross margin for the year-to-date period has increased to 29.3 percent
in 2004 compared to 28.7 percent in 2003. SG&A expenses have increased
as a percentage to sales to 23.1 percent in 2004 from 22.4 percent in
2003, with the most significant increases relating to increased rental
expense on the Company's leased facilities, increased costs associated
with store physical inventory counts, increased professional fees
associated with the Company's 2004 store work-flow project and
increased expenses resulting from the acceptance of debit cards.
    The Company's effective tax rate was 34.4 percent in the current
year-to-date period versus 35.9 percent in the comparable prior year
period. Excluding the adjustments to reduce certain contingent income
tax-related liabilities, the Company's effective tax rate would have
been 37.3 percent. This rate is higher than the Company's tax rate in
the prior year period due in part to the expiration of certain federal
jobs tax credits. The Company estimates that the expiration of these
federal tax credit programs increased its 2004 effective tax rate by
approximately 0.5 percent. The Company estimates that its effective
income tax rate for the remainder of the 2004 fiscal year will be
approximately 37.3 percent.
    Through July 30, 2004, the Company has opened 418 Dollar General
stores and two Dollar General Markets and has closed 41 Dollar General
stores. Store openings are on track to meet or exceed the Company's
target of 695 total new stores this year. Year-to-date cash capital
expenditures were $124.8 million.
    The Company has repurchased a total of approximately 10.5 million
shares of its common stock to date, including 0.9 million shares
purchased during the second quarter of 2004, with respect to its 12
million share repurchase authorization which expires on March 13,
2005. Year-to-date, the Company has repurchased 9.0 million shares at
a total cost of $169.4 million.
    Dollar General also announced today that in addition to cash and
personal checks, substantially all of its stores are now accepting any
bank's debit and check cards via pin entry as well as Discover(R)Card.
In addition, the Company has accelerated the pace of EBT acceptance in
its stores with refrigerated coolers and is currently accepting EBT in
over 3,000 stores.

    Non-GAAP Disclosures

    This press release and the tables accompanying this release
include certain financial information not derived in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), including net
income, earnings per share, and the Company's effective income tax
rate excluding an adjustment resulting from the reduction of certain
income tax liabilities and the related interest accruals. Also, the
accompanying tables include calculations of return on invested capital
and return on assets each of which is calculated using certain
financial results that exclude restatement-related items. In addition,
return on invested capital may be considered a non-GAAP financial
measure. None of this information should be considered a substitute
for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. The reasons why
management believes return on capital and return on assets, excluding
restatement-related items, are useful to investors, and the additional
purposes for which management uses this information are disclosed in
the Company's Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 16, 2004.
Management believes that net income, earnings per share, and the
effective income tax rate, excluding the income tax-related
adjustment, more clearly reflect the Company's actual performance on a
comparable and ongoing basis.

    Forward-Looking Information

(a) The Company believes that the most directly comparable ratio
    calculated solely using GAAP measures is the ratio of net income
    to the sum of average long-term obligations, including current
    portion, and average shareholders' equity. This ratio was 17.9%
    and 17.7% for the rolling four quarters ended July 30, 2004 and
    August 1, 2003, respectively.
(b) Average long-term obligations is equal to the average long-term
    obligations, including current portion, measured at the end of
    each of the last five fiscal quarters.
(c) Average shareholders' equity is equal to the average shareholders'
    equity measured at the end of each of the last five fiscal
    quarters.
(d) Average rent expense is computed using a rolling two-year period.
    Average rent expense is multiplied by a factor of eight to
    capitalize operating leases in the determination of pretax
    invested capital. This is a conventional methodology utilized by
    credit rating agencies and investment bankers.
