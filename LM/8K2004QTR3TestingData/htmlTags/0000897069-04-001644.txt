              Controlling Our Future Through Vertical Integration


                    NOBILITY HOMES ANNOUNCES INCREASED SALES
                     AND EARNINGS FOR ITS THIRD QUARTER 2004

         Ocala, FL...September 9, 2004-- Today Nobility Homes, Inc. (NASDAQ:
NOBH) announced sales and earnings results for its third quarter ended July 31,
2004. Sales for the third quarter were up 30% to $12,310,878 as compared to
$9,465,179 recorded in third quarter of 2003. Income from operations increased
107% to $1,670,160 versus $808,164 in the same period a year ago. Net income
after taxes was up 93% to $1,220,138 as compared to $633,730 for the same period
last year. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter improved 88% to
$0.30 per share compared to $0.16 per share last year.
         For the first nine months of fiscal 2004, sales increased 35% to
$35,621,719 as compared to sales of $26,302,356 in the first nine months of last
fiscal year. Income from operations for the first nine months improved 68% to
$4,276,005 versus $2,542,522 in the same period last year. Net income increased
52% to $3,157,376 versus last year's results of $2,079,092. Diluted earnings per
share were up 48% to $0.77 per share versus last year's nine months results of
$0.52 per share.
         Nobility's financial position continued to improve during the third
quarter of 2004 and remains very strong with cash and cash equivalents, short
and long-term investments of $17,358,976 and no outstanding debt. Working
capital is $14,567,824 and our ratio of current assets to current liabilities is
3.8:1. Stockholders' equity increased to $29,716,464 and the book value per
share of common stock increased to $7.40. The Company did not purchase any
shares of its common stock during the third quarter of 2004 but is authorized by
the Company's Board of Directors to purchase up to 100,000 additional shares of
the Company's stock in the open market.
         "Third quarter sales of fiscal 2004 were strong even with tight retail
credit standards still evident; improving, but high unemployment; and uncertain
economic conditions present in our country. Latest three-month manufactured
housing industry shipments nationwide, declined an estimated 6%, and industry
shipments in Florida, our primary market, were up an estimated 16%", President
Terry Trexler said.
         Trexler continued, "Although Nobility continues to out-perform the
industry, in the near term we anticipate continued pressure on both sales and
earnings resulting from these factors, plus continuous price increases in
lumber, OSB, sheetrock, steel and oil related products and services. Management
is optimistic for the remainder of fiscal 2004, convinced that our specific
geographic market is one of the best long-term growth areas in the country and
because of the strong operating leverage inherent in the Company. With an
improving economy, better consumer confidence, declining unemployment claims,
and increasing but still low interest rates in 2004, management expects the
demand for our homes to improve. Increase demand also could result from building
replacement homes due to the recent hurricanes in Florida. The Company is well
positioned to capitalize on the demand in the future by controlling the retail
distribution, financing, and insuring of our homes and by being financially
sound to take advantage of opportunities as they develop."
         Nobility Homes, Inc. has specialized for the past 37 years in the
design and production of quality, affordable manufactured homes at its two
plants located in central Florida. With 17 Company owned retail sales centers, a
finance company joint venture, and an insurance subsidiary, Nobility is the only
vertically integrated manufactured home company headquartered in Florida.

         MANAGEMENT WILL HOLD A CONFERENCE CALL ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 2004,
AT 4:30 PM EASTERN TIME.  TO PARTICIPATE, PLEASE DIAL 800-967-7188.  THE

Certain statements in this report are forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the federal securities laws, including our statement that working
capital requirements will be met with internal sources. Although Nobility
believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are
based on reasonable assumptions, there are risks and uncertainties that may
cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. These risks and
uncertainties include, but are not limited to, competitive pricing pressures at
both the wholesale and retail levels, increasing material costs, continued
excess retail inventory, increase in repossessions, changes in market demand,
changes in interest rates, availability of financing for retail and wholesale
purchases, consumer confidence, adverse weather conditions that reduce sales at
retail centers, the risk of manufacturing plant shutdowns due to storms or other
factors, and the impact of marketing and cost-management programs.
