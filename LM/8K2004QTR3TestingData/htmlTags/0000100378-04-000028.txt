TWIN DISC, INC., ANNOUNCES SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER FISCAL 2004 FOURTH-QUARTER AND
AND FULL-YEAR EARNINGS VERSUS PRIOR YEAR

Third-Quarter EPS $0.62 versus $0.18
Nine-Months EPS $0.86 versus Loss of $1.54
Trailing 12 Months EPS $1.56 versus Loss of $1.05
Management Sees Improving Earnings Trend Continuing

RACINE, WISCONSIN-JULY 30, 2004-Twin Disc, Inc. (NYSE: TDI), today announced
improved financial results for the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter and full year
ended June 30, 2004.  The fiscal 2004 quarter was the sixth-consecutive
period earnings improved year-over-year, and the sales level was the
highest in over 20 years.

Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 increased 7.6 percent to
$57,146,000 from $53,100,000 for the same period last year. Sales were
positively impacted by net favorable currency exhcange rates, primarily
the Euro and Australian Dollar in relation to the U.S. Dollar, of
approximately $1.7 million compared with the same quarter last year. The
Company's joint venture agreement governing it's subsidiary in Japan was
amended effective in the fiscal 2004 first quarter. The effect of this
change had no impact on net earnings during this quarter. Last year's
fiscal fourth-quarter results, however, included $3.6 million in sales
for certain territories that are no longer recognized by the joint
venture. If these were excluded, sales in the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter
would have been 15.4 percent highter than the same period last year.

Profitability in the quarter continued to improve from the implementation
of cost reduction programs, a restructuring program undertaken last year,
a better product mix and the absence of manufacturing inefficiencies which
absorbed higher steel, energy and shipping costs. The gross margin in the
fiscal 2004 fiscal 2004 quarter improved 385 basis points over the same
period  last year. For the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter, net income was
$2,788,000, or $0.97 per diluted share, compared with last year's net income
of $1,941,000, or $0.70 per diluted share.

Net sales for the 2004 full year were up 3.6 percent to $1,86,089,000
compared with last year's $179,591,000. Included in the 2004 sales were net
favorable currency exchange rate benefits of approximately $10.0 milllion
compared with the same period last year. The prior year included $13.0
million in sales from the Japenese distribution subsidiary that are no
longer recognized in accordance with the amended agreement discussed
previously. This change had no impact on net earnings. The sequence of
the manufacturing effcienciesthat began in the prior fiscal year
contributed strongly to the 610 basis point improvement in the gross margin
for fiscal 2004 compared with last year. Net income for 2004 was $5,243,000,
or $1.84 per diluted share compared with last year's net loss of $2,368,000,
or $0.84 per share.

Michael E. Batten, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We were very
pleased that the sales and earnings improvements that began in fiscal 2003
gained momentum throughout this year. Our people were consistently challenged
in fiscal 2004 especially during the second half, to maintain manufacturing
quality at high production rates. Our shipments were up, on a sequential
basis, nearly 18.0 percent in the fourth quarter and 15.0 percent in the third
quarter.

"In the fourth quarter we acquired a wonderful company, Rolla SP Propellers.
Based in Switzerland, Rolla is a leading international designer and
manufacturer of high-performance propulsion products. The acquisition will
have no impact on this year's operating results because it closed on June 30,
2004, but will be accretive to fiscal 2005's financial results. Our Arneson
operation has worked closely with Rolla over the years and having its
hydrodynamic technology in house will further enhance its quality and service.

"In addition, our balance sheet stregthened at year end because of our strong
asset management and the financial imporvements. Shareholders' equity
increased nearly 21.0 percent to $60.7 million, or $21.37 per share, while
long-term debt was up modestly, and the accrued retirement liability declined
by almost 13.0 percent.

"Our backlog of orders may have a greater variance over comparable periods
because our selling cycle is narrowing. Orders to be shipped over the next
six months were $49,400,000 which was an increase of more than 60.0 percent
from the start of the fiscal year, but down modestly from the prior quarter's
$52,300,000. Our marketing activity and production schedules are higher
than normal for this time of year, seasonally a softer period, which bodes
well for our fiscal 2005 outlook"
