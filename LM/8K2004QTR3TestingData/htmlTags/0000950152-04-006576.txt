MISSION WOODS, KANSAS, AUGUST 31, 2004 - LAYNE CHRISTENSEN COMPANY (NASDAQ:
LAYN), today announced net income from continuing operations for the second
quarter ended July 31, 2004 of $3,749,000, or $0.29 per share, compared to a
loss from continuing operations of $377,000 or $0.03 per share, in the same
period last year. Revenues for the three months ended July 31, 2004 increased
$15,998,000, or 22.8%, to $86,186,000, compared to $70,188,000 the same period
last year.

"A very strong quarter as all our divisions were up at the same time," said
Andrew B. Schmitt, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Given our mix of
business, we are benefiting from a number of positive drivers impacting natural
resource demand and an improving economy. Normally, we would experience a few
bumps along the way. This quarter we were hitting on all cylinders."

Gross profit as a percentage of revenues was 27.9% and 27.1% for the three and
six months ended July 31, 2004 compared to 29.1% and 29.0% for the three and six
months ended July 31, 2003. The decreases in gross profit percentage were
primarily attributable to continued pricing pressures from municipal customers
in the water resources division along with reduced margins associated with the
promotion of certain new water treatment products. The decreases in the water
resources division margins were partially offset by increased margins in the
mineral exploration division due to increased exploration activity because of
higher gold and base metal prices.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $14,471,000 for the
three months ended July 31, 2004 and increased to $28,396,000 for the six months
ended July 31, 2004 compared to $15,124,000 and $27,623,000 for the three and
six months ended July 31, 2003. Excluding severance-related benefits of
$1,244,000 accrued in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the increase for both
the three and six month periods was primarily related to the Company's expansion
of its water treatment capabilities, increased expenses associated with the
Company's coalbed methane ("CBM") development efforts and incremental costs of
approximately $650,000 for the implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley requirements.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased to $3,338,000 and $6,523,000
for the three and six months ended July 31, 2004 compared to $2,951,000 and
$6,011,000 for the same periods last year. The increase was primarily a result
of increased depreciation in the mineral exploration division and depletion
associated with the Company's CBM projects.

The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2,320,000 for the
three and six months ended July 31, 2003. The loss represents prepayment
penalties and the write-off of associated deferred fees in connection with
refinancing of the Company's credit facilities in July 2003.

Income tax expense of $3,751,000 and $5,289,000 were recorded for the three and
six months ended July 31, 2004, compared to $663,000 and $1,527,000 for the same
periods last year. The debt extinguishment costs recorded in the second quarter
of fiscal 2004 were treated as discrete period items for interim tax accounting
purposes, which resulted in the recording of a tax benefit at the statutory tax
rate. Exclusive of the impact of the tax treatment of the debt extinguishment
costs in July 2003, the effective rate was 50% for the six months ended July 31,
2004 compared to 60.7% for the same period last year. The improvement in the
effective rate is primarily attributable to improved earnings in international
operations. The effective rate in excess of the statutory federal rate was a
result of the impact of nondeductible expenses and the tax treatment of certain
foreign operations.

</TABLE>

Water resources revenues increased 7.4% to $47,918,000, and 11.8% to
$93,201,000, for the three and six months ended July 31, 2004, respectively. The
increases were primarily attributable to the Company's continued efforts to
maintain market share, results from the Company's water treatment initiatives
and increased infrastructure needs in metropolitan areas of California and
Illinois.

Income from continuing operations for the water resources division increased
31.0% to $6,299,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2004, and 8.6% to
$10,330,000 for the six months ended July 31, 2004 compared to $4,807,000 and
$9,510,000 for the three and six months ended July 31, 2003. The increases in
income from continuing operations were primarily the result of the incremental
earnings impact from increases in revenues.

</TABLE>

Mineral exploration revenues increased 55.3% to $26,153,000 and 62.6% to
$50,242,000 for the three and six months ended July 31, 2004 compared to
revenues of $16,836,000 and $30,892,000 for the three and six months ended July
31, 2003. The increase for the periods was primarily the result of increased
exploration activity in the Company's markets due to higher gold and base metal
prices. Additionally, increases in Africa were partially the result of capacity
from the purchase of DrillCorp assets late in fiscal 2004.

Income from continuing operations for the mineral exploration division was
$3,705,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2004 and $7,227,000 for the six
months ended July 31, 2004, compared to $1,213,000 and $1,003,000 for the three
and six months ended July 31, 2003. The improved earnings in the division were
primarily attributable to the increased activity levels noted above and improved
earnings by the Company's Latin American affiliates. In addition, in the prior
year, the Company incurred increased expenses in Australia to bring equipment
into compliance with changes to local transportation regulations.

Geoconstruction revenues increased 33.2% to $10,949,000 and 18.7% to $17,039,000
for the three and six months ended July 31, 2004 compared to $8,221,000 and
$14,352,000 for the three and six months ended July 31, 2003. The increases in
revenues were primarily attributable to certain large domestic projects and
increased product sales by the Company's manufacturing unit in Italy.

Income from continuing operations for the geoconstruction division increased
54.9% to $1,654,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2004, and 19.4% to
$1,519,000 for the six months ended July 31, 2004 compared to $1,068,000 and
$1,272,000 for the three and six months ended July 31, 2003. The increases in
income from continuing operations were primarily the result of the incremental
earnings impact from increases in revenues.

Energy revenues increased 122.5% to $1,166,000 and 45.7% to 1,913,000 for the
three and six months ended July 31, 2004, compared to revenues of $524,000 and
$1,313,000 for the three and six months ended July 31, 2003. Increased
production from the Company's CBM projects resulted in the increases in revenues
for the three and six months ended July 31, 2004 compared to the same periods
last year.

Losses from continuing operations for the energy division were $1,000 and
$1,019,000 for the three and six months ended July 31, 2004 compared to $176,000
and $546,000 for the three and six months ended July 31, 2003. The loss for the
three months ended July 31, 2004 included a gain on the sale of exploration
equipment of approximately $906,000. Excluding the gain, the loss from
continuing operations would have been $907,000 and $1,925,000 for the three and
six months ended July 31, 2004, respectively, and was primarily a result of
increased expenses associated with exploration and development activity and a
slow first half of the year in the division's energy service businesses.

UNALLOCATED CORPORATE EXPENSES

Corporate expenses not allocated to individual divisions decreased to $3,424,000
for the three months ended July 31, 2004 and increased to $6,065,000 for the six
months ended July 31, 2004 compared to $3,741,000 and $6,016,000 for the three
and six months ended July 31, 2003. Excluding severance-related costs of
approximately $800,000 included in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the
increases for both the three and six


                                       4

month periods were primarily due to incremental costs of approximately $650,000
for the implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley requirements and higher travel-related
expenses.

OUTLOOK

Andrew B. Schmitt, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Looking
forward from a macro standpoint, we expect to continue to benefit from natural
resource demand, the improving financial condition of U.S. municipalities and
stronger non-residential construction spending. More specifically, in the third
quarter we expect to experience a slow down in mineral exploration in Africa as
we enter the wet season and in South America, as they are in their winter
months. The water resource business should continue to recover while
Geoconstruction's backlog is steadily increasing. On the Energy side, we expect
CBM production will continue to grow and gas prices remain very attractive. With
mineral exploration now making a positive contribution, the balance we derive
from the industries in which we participate becomes a positive factor again for
the Company."
