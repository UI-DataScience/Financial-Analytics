   Actuant Announces Record Results, Increases Fiscal 2005 Guidance

    MILWAUKEE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 30, 2004--Actuant Corporation
(NYSE:ATU) today announced results for its fourth quarter and fiscal
year ended August 31, 2004. Fourth quarter sales increased
approximately 27% to $187.8 million compared to $148.2 million in the
prior year. Current year results include those from Kwikee Products
Company Inc. ("Kwikee") and Dresco B.V. ("Dresco"), which were
acquired during fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of these
acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes on translated
results, fourth quarter sales increased approximately 11% from the
comparable prior year period. Fourth quarter fiscal 2004 net earnings
and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") were $18.3 million and $0.75
per diluted share, respectively, compared to fiscal 2003 fourth
quarter net earnings and diluted earnings per share of $10.0 million
and $0.41 per diluted share, respectively. Fourth quarter fiscal 2004
results include a charge of $7.1 million, net of tax, or $0.29 per
diluted share, arising from the tender of the Company's 13% Senior
Subordinated Notes (the "13% Notes") and net income from discontinued
operations of $10.9 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, due to the
release of a reserve for tax and other obligations related to the
spin-off of APW Ltd. in fiscal 2000 (the "Spin-off"). Excluding these
special items, current year fourth quarter net earnings increased 44%
to $0.59 per diluted share (see attached reconciliation of earnings).
    Actuant's sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2004 were
$726.9 million, approximately 24% higher than the $585.4 million
generated in the prior year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and
foreign currency rate changes, fiscal 2004 sales increased
approximately 9% from the comparable prior year period. Net earnings
for the year ended August 31, 2004 were $34.8 million, or $1.41 per
diluted share, compared to $29.0 million, or $1.18 per diluted share,
in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2004, the Company recorded net of tax
special charges of $25.1 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, due to
the early extinguishment of debt and income from discontinued
operations of $10.9 million, net of tax, or $0.44 per diluted share,
due to the release of a reserve for tax and other obligations related
to the Spin-off. In fiscal 2003, the Company recorded net of tax
special charges of $1.3 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, for the
early extinguishment of debt and $4.2 million, or $0.18 per diluted
share, for litigation matters associated with businesses divested
prior to the Spin-off. Excluding these special charges, net earnings
and diluted earnings per share for the year ended August 31, 2004 were
$49.0 million, or $1.99 per diluted share, over 40% higher than the
$34.4 million, or $1.41 per diluted share in the prior year (see
attached reconciliation of earnings).
    Commenting on the results, Robert C. Arzbaecher, Chief Executive
Officer, stated, "Actuant finished fiscal 2004 strongly, as fourth
quarter results exceeded our expectations in terms of sales, earnings,
and cash flow. Core sales grew 11% over the prior year and excluding
the special items (described above), Actuant increased its
year-over-year earnings per share for the 13th consecutive quarter."
    Arzbaecher continued, "Favorable economic conditions and margin
expansion across both segments helped drive record fourth quarter
earnings. We also benefited from a sequential improvement in
automotive margins, as well as earnings contributions from both Kwikee
and Dresco. Focus on Actuant's LEAD (Lean Enterprise Across
Disciplines) Process, active working capital management, and increased
earnings drove another quarter of strong cash flow, reducing net debt
to approximately $188 million at year-end. Despite the $65 million
spent on acquisitions and $30 million of premiums paid to retire 13%
Notes in fiscal 2004, our leverage ratio (debt/EBITDA) at year-end was
lower than at the start of the year." (EBITDA is earnings before
interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and minority
interest).
    He concluded, "We are pleased with fiscal 2004 results - core
sales growth of 9%, the completion of two accretive bolt-on
acquisitions, improving margins and strong cash flow. On a full-year
basis and excluding special charges in both years, the $1.99 diluted
earnings per share in fiscal 2004 was 41% higher than a year ago, and
was the third straight year of EPS growth in excess of 15%. Both Tools
& Supplies and Engineered Solutions had excellent years as we saw a
recovering North American economy. Looking forward to fiscal 2005, we
are optimistic that we will be able to continue to generate earnings
growth. Given improved economic conditions, the recent acquisition of
Yvel S.A. and lower borrowing costs due to the completion of the 13%
Notes tender, we are increasing our previously announced fiscal 2005
guidance. We now expect diluted earnings per share of $2.25-$2.35 in
2005 on sales of $750-$775 million. First quarter sales should be in
the $185-$190 million range, and diluted earnings per share should be
in the range of $0.53-$0.58 per share."
    Fiscal 2004 fourth quarter Tools & Supplies segment sales were
$106.3 million, approximately 15% higher than last year due primarily
to the Dresco acquisition and foreign currency rate changes. Excluding
Dresco and the impact of foreign currency rate changes, fourth quarter
Tools & Supplies segment revenues increased 2% over the prior year.
Fourth quarter fiscal 2004 Engineered Solutions segment sales
increased approximately 46% to $81.5 million, compared to $55.8
million in the previous year. Excluding the impact of the Kwikee
acquisition and foreign currency rate changes, Engineered Solutions
sales increased 26%, benefiting from growth in all three of Actuant's
main actuation markets - automotive convertible top, heavy duty truck
cab-tilt, and recreational vehicles.
    Actuant's fiscal 2004 fourth quarter operating profit increased
27% to $24.3 million, in line with the corresponding increase in
sales. The increases in operating profit in fiscal 2004 reflect the
benefit of cost reductions implemented over the past year and improved
automotive labor efficiencies. These improvements were partially
offset by increased corporate expenses.

    Safe Harbor Statement

    Certain of the above comments represent forward-looking statements
made pursuant to the provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Management cautions that these statements are
based on current estimates of future performance and are highly
dependent upon a variety of factors, which could cause actual results
to differ from these estimates. Actuant's results are also subject to
general economic conditions, variation in demand from customers, the
impact of geopolitical activity on the economy, continued market
acceptance of the Company's new product introductions, the successful
integration of business unit acquisitions and related restructuring,
operating margin risk due to competitive pricing and operating
efficiencies, supply chain risk, material and labor cost increases,
foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate risk. See the
Company's registration statements filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission for further information regarding risk factors.

(1) Net earnings and diluted earnings per share excluding discontinued
    operations and special items represent net earnings and diluted
    earnings per share per the Consolidated Statement of Earnings net
    of charges or credits for items that are not representative of the
    normal recurring operations of the current portfolio of Actuant
    companies. These items include results from discontinued
    operations, expenses recorded to extinguish debt entered into at
    the time of the spin-off and litigation charges related to matters
    associated with businesses divested prior to the spin-off. These
    measures should not be considered as an alternative to net
    earnings or diluted earnings per share as an indicator of the
    company's operating performance. However, this presentation is
    important to investors for understanding the operating results of
    the current portfolio of Actuant companies.

(2) EBITDA represents net earnings before net financing costs, income
    tax expense, depreciation & amortization and minority interest.
    EBITDA excluding discontinued operations and special items is net
    of charges or credits that are not representative of the normal
    recurring operations of the current portfolio of Actuant
    companies. These special items include results from discontinued
    operations, expenses recorded to extinguish debt entered into at
    the time of the spin-off and litigation charges related to matters
    associated with businesses divested prior to the spin-off. EBITDA
    is not a calculation based upon generally accepted accounting
    principles (GAAP). The amounts included in the EBITDA calculation,
    however, are derived from amounts included in the Consolidated
    Statements of Earnings data. EBITDA should not be considered as an
    alternative to net earnings or operating profit as an indicator of
    the company's operating performance, or as an alternative to
    operating cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Actuant has
    presented EBITDA because it regularly reviews this as a measure of
    the company's ability to incur and service debt. In addition,
    EBITDA is used by many of our investors and lenders, and is
    presented as a convenience to them. However, the EBITDA measure
    presented may not always be comparable to similarly titled
    measures reported by other companies due to differences in the
    components of the calculation.

(3) First quarter 2003 special items include a $2.0 million charge
    related to the early redemption of debt and a $7.3 million charge
    related to litigation for business units divested prior to the
    July 31, 2000 spin-off. Third quarter 2003 special items
    represents an $0.8 million reversal of a portion of the $7.3
    million first quarter charge for the favorable settlement of such
    litigation. First, third and fourth quarter 2004 special items
    represents charges related to the early redemption of debt. Second
    quarter 2004 special items represents the non-cash charge
    attributable to the write-off of remaining debt issuance costs
    associated with the senior secured credit facility that was
    replaced during February 2004.
