    Item 2.02 - Results of Operations and Financial Condition

On August 26, 2004, Culp, Inc. (the "Registrant" or the "company") issued a news
release to announce its financial  results for the first quarter ended August 1,
2004. The news release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99(a).

Also on August 26, 2004, the Registrant released a Financial Information Release
containing   additional   financial   information  and  disclosures   about  the
Registrant's  first  quarter  ended August 1, 2004.  The  Financial  Information
Release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99(b).

The news release and Financial  Information  Release contain  disclosures  about
proforma  income  statement  information,  which  reconciles the reported income
statement  information with proforma  results,  which exclude  restructuring and
related   charges  and  credits.   The  company  has  included   this   proforma
information in order to show  operational  performance  excluding the effects of
restructuring  and related  charges and credits  that are not  expected to occur
on  a  regular  basis.   Management  believes  this  presentation  aids  in  the
comparison of financial results among comparable financial periods.


Forward  Looking  Information.  This  Report and the  exhibits  attached  hereto
contain  statements that may be deemed  "forward-looking  statements" within the
meaning  of the  federal  securities  laws,  including  the  Private  Securities
Litigation  Reform Act of 1995  (Section 27A of the  Securities  Act of 1933 and
Section 27A of the  Securities  and Exchange Act of 1934).  Such  statements are
inherently  subject  to  risks  and  uncertainties.   Further,  forward  looking
statements  are  intended  to speak  only as of the date on which they are made.
Forward-looking statements are statements that include projections, expectations
or beliefs  about future  events or results or otherwise  are not  statements of
historical  fact.  Such  statements  are often but not always  characterized  by
qualifying words such as "expect,"  "believe,"  "estimate," "plan" and "project"
and their  derivatives,  and  include but are not  limited to  statements  about
expectations for the company's  future sales,  gross profit and operating income
margins,  SG&A or other expenses and earnings.  Factors that could influence the
matters  discussed in such  statements  include the level of housing  starts and
sales of existing homes,  consumer confidence,  trends in disposable income, and
general economic conditions. Decreases in these economic indicators could have a
negative effect on the company's business and prospects.  Likewise, increases in
interest rates, particularly home mortgage rates, and increases in consumer debt
or the  general  rate of  inflation,  could  affect the  company  adversely.  In
addition,  strengthening of the U. S. dollar against other currencies could make
the company's products less competitive on the basis of price in markets outside
the United States.  Also,  economic and political  instability in  international
areas could affect the company's  operations or sources of goods in those areas,
as well as demand for the company's products in international markets.  Finally,
unanticipated delays or costs in executing restructuring actions could cause the
cumulative  effect of  restructuring  actions to fail to meet the objectives set
forth by  management.  Other factors that could affect the matters  discussed in
forward looking  statements are included in the company's periodic reports filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

                CULP ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 2005 RESULTS


HIGH POINT,  N.C.  (August 26, 2004) - Culp,  Inc.  (NYSE:  CFI) today  reported
financial  and  operating  results  for the first  quarter of fiscal  2005 ended
August 1, 2004. The highlights include:

o     Mattress  fabrics  segment  average  weekly  sales  up 2.7  percent during
      period of transition to one-sided mattresses.

o     Aggressive  expansion  of  offshore  sourcing  capabilities,  resulting in
      sales of  sourced  upholstery  fabrics  more  than  doubling over the same
      period last year.

o     Long-term   debt-to-capital  ratio  of  33.3  percent compared  with  44.5
      percent a year ago.

o     Earnings  expectation  for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 is net income
      of $0.13 to $0.17 per diluted share.

Overview

For the three months ended August 1, 2004, net sales were $67.8 million compared
with  $73.7  million a year ago, a 7.9  percent  decline.  The first  quarter of
fiscal  2005  included 13 weeks  versus 14 weeks for the same  quarter of fiscal
2004. The company reported a net loss of $1,052,000, or $0.09 per diluted share,
for the first quarter of fiscal 2005  compared  with a net loss of $411,000,  or
$0.04 per  diluted  share,  for the first  quarter  of  fiscal  2004.  Excluding
restructuring and related charges and credits of approximately  $42,000,  net of
income taxes,  the net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 was $1,094,000,
or $0.09 per diluted share.

"Considering  one less  week's  sales,  our average  weekly  sales for the first
fiscal  quarter  of 2005 were $5.2  million  compared  with $5.3  million in the
prior-year  period,  a decrease of less than 1.0 percent,"  commented  Robert G.
Culp, III,  chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Culp, Inc. "The
first  quarter of our fiscal year is typically  the slowest  period for Culp and
the furniture  industry with scheduled  plant vacation  shutdowns.  The seasonal
slowdown,  combined with the continued weakness in consumer demand for furniture
throughout  the  summer,   accounted  for  this  modest  drop.  We  believe  our
competitive position is strong and we are excited about the growth opportunities
in our mattress ticking business and our offshore sourcing strategy."

Mattress Fabrics Segment

Mattress  fabric (known as mattress  ticking) sales were $26.0 million  compared
with $27.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2004, a 4.7 percent  decline.
As noted,  these results  reflect a 13-week  period versus a 14-week period last
year.  Average  weekly  sales for the  first  quarter  of fiscal  2005 were $2.0
million compared with $1.9 million in the prior-year  period, an increase of 2.7
percent.  This  increase is especially  noteworthy  considering  our  customers'
recent transition to one-sided mattresses,  which utilize one-third less fabric.
Operating  income for this segment was $2.9  million,  or 11.2 percent of sales,
compared with $4.1 million, or 15.2 percent of sales, for the prior-year period.
Operating income was primarily affected by one week's less sales for the quarter
and inventory markdowns related to certain customer programs.  These factors are
expected to have  significantly  less  impact on the  segment's  second  quarter
results.

Culp remarked,  "We are seeing positive trends in our mattress  ticking business
and  continue  to  make  gains  with  key  customers.  Consumer  trends  and the
attractiveness  of this product  category for retailers  favor further growth in
bedding demand, and we believe that Culp is well positioned to benefit from this
growth  as  a  leading  provider  of  mattress  ticking.  Additionally,   unlike
upholstery  fabrics,  the mattress  fabric  business is not being  threatened by
Asian  imports  because of the  relatively  low average  price  points and labor
content and the just-in-time  delivery  requirements of this business.  Further,
Asian imports of finished mattresses have been limited to less than four percent
of the U.S.  market  because of high  shipping  costs as well as the  customized
product lines and strong brand name recognition associated with mattresses. With
our  leadership  in product  design,  superior  customer  service  and  delivery
performance,  and a globally  competitive  cost  structure,  we expect  that the
mattress  ticking  business will account for an increasing  percentage of Culp's
overall sales and profitability in fiscal 2005."

Upholstery Fabrics Segment

Sales for this segment were $41.9 million,  a 9.8 percent decline  compared with
$46.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.  Average weekly sales for the
first quarter of fiscal 2005 were $3.2 million compared with $3.3 million in the
prior year  period,  a decrease  of 2.9  percent.  Sales of  upholstery  fabrics
reflect soft demand by furniture retailers during the summer months.  Additional
factors  affecting the demand for  upholstery  fabrics are the current  consumer
preference  for  leather  furniture  and  increased  competition  from  imported
fabrics, including cut and sewn kits, primarily from Asia.

"It has  become  increasingly  evident  that  competitive  forces in the  global
marketplace  are  significantly  changing  the  face  of the  furniture  and the
upholstery fabrics industries," added Culp.  "However,  we believe that Culp has
made  significant  progress in adapting our business  model to take advantage of
this  transition and position  ourselves more  effectively in this  environment.
First,  we  have   significantly   adjusted  our  cost  structure  and  domestic
manufacturing  capacity over the past several years.  Second, we have focused on
design  creativity and product  development to provide breadth and innovation in
the fabrics  offered to our  customers to meet  changing  consumer  preferences.
Third,  we have  implemented a dual strategy to  aggressively  develop  offshore
sourcing  capabilities  for Culp.  In fiscal 2003 we put in place the  necessary
resources to begin sourcing from Asia certain  upholstery fabrics that we do not
manufacture,  and we  have  continued  to  expand  these  resources.  The  other
component of Culp's offshore sourcing strategy is our China operation,  where we
are now well underway with our manufacturing operations and our fabric shipments
to  customers.  Sales  of  upholstery  fabrics  produced  outside  of  our  U.S.
manufacturing  plants, which include the popular micro-denier suedes and fabrics
produced at our China facility,  accounted for  approximately  $5.5 million,  or
13.1 percent,  of  upholstery  fabric  sales for the  quarter.  Sourced  fabrics
accounted for  approximately  $2.1 million,  or 4.5 percent of upholstery fabric
sales for the same period last year."

Operating  loss for the  upholstery  fabrics  segment was $2.6  million,  or 6.1
percent of sales, compared with a loss of $1.7 million, or 3.7 percent of sales,
for the same period last year. The segment loss in each period was primarily due
to underutilization of the company's U.S.  manufacturing  capacity.  Culp noted,
"If sales continue to be under pressure in the upholstery  fabrics  segment,  we
are prepared to take the necessary  actions to further adjust our cost structure
and U.S. capacity, as we have demonstrated in recent years."

Balance Sheet

"One  of our  key  financial  objectives  for  fiscal  2005  is to  continue  to
capitalize on the strength of our balance sheet," added Culp. "At the end of the
first fiscal quarter, our balance sheet reflects  approximately $12.0 million in
cash and cash  equivalents.  Long-term debt now stands at $51.1 million compared
with $76.6 million a year ago. As a result, our long-term  debt-to-capital ratio
is now 33.3 percent  compared with 44.5 percent a year ago. Our balance sheet is
sound with  significantly  lower debt,  excellent  liquidity  and the  financial
flexibility to pursue our strategic initiatives."

Outlook

Commenting  on the business  outlook,  Culp said,  "Mattress  ticking sales have
already picked up during the early part of our second  quarter.  For the current
quarter,  we  expect  sales in this  segment  to be  moderately  ahead of second
quarter sales last year and expect that operating  income will  approximate last
year's  level.  With  respect to the  upholstery  fabrics  segment,  the outlook
remains  uncertain  for  a  sustained  recovery  in  retail  furniture  business
conditions.  We are optimistic that upholstery fabric sales will also pick up in
the fall, as is seasonally  typical in the  furniture  industry.  For the second
quarter, upholstery fabrics segment sales are expected to decrease less than the
first quarter decline of 9.8 percent. While we do expect to be profitable in the
upholstery fabrics segment, operating income will be down considerably from last
year's second quarter. At this time, we expect to report net income in the range
of $0.13 to $0.17 per share diluted, with the actual results depending primarily
on the level of demand throughout the quarter.  We believe the excellence in our
design creativity, the strength in our mattress ticking business, the aggressive
expansion of our offshore  sourcing  capabilities  and our sound  balance  sheet
effectively position Culp in today's marketplace."

Culp,  Inc.  is one of the world's  largest  marketers  of mattress  fabrics for
bedding and  upholstery  fabrics for furniture.  The company's  fabrics are used
principally in the production of bedding products and residential and commercial
upholstered furniture.

                    CULP, INC. FINANCIAL INFORMATION RELEASE
                               FINANCIAL NARRATIVE
          for the three months ended August 1, 2004 and August 3, 2003




OVERVIEW

Highlights for the first quarter ended August 1, 2004 , include:

o     Mattress  fabrics  segment  average  weekly  sales  up 2.7 percent  during
      period of transition to one-sided mattresses.

o     Aggressive  expansion  of  offshore  sourcing  capabilities,  resulting in
      sales  of sourced  upholstery fabrics  more than  doubling over  the  same
      period last year.

o     Long-term debt-to-capital ratio of 33.3% compared with 44.5% a year ago.

o     Earnings  expectation for the second  quarter of fiscal 2005 is net income
      of $0.13 to $0.17 per diluted share.


GENERAL - The first quarter of the fiscal year is typically  the slowest  period
for the company and the  furniture  industry  due to  scheduled  plant  vacation
shutdowns.  The  seasonal  slowdown,  combined  with the  continued  weakness in
consumer demand for furniture  throughout the summer,  accounted for this modest
drop. In addition,  the first quarter of fiscal 2005 included 13 weeks versus 14
weeks for the same period of fiscal 2004.  For the first quarter of fiscal 2005,
net sales  decreased 7.9% to $67.8  million.  Average weekly sales for the first
quarter of fiscal 2005 were $5.2 million compared with $5.3 million in the prior
year period,  a decrease of less than 1.0%.  The company  reported a net loss of
$1,052,000, or $0.09 per share diluted, compared with a net loss of $411,000, or
$0.04 per  share  diluted,  in the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  2004.  Excluding
restructuring and related charges and credits of approximately  $42,000,  net of
income taxes, the net loss for the quarter was $1,094,000.  These results are in
line with the  previously  announced  guidance of an  expected  loss of $0.08 to
$0.13 per share.


STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS COMMENTS


     MATTRESS FABRICS SEGMENT (See page 5 - Sales, Gross Profit and Operating
     Income (Loss) by Segment)

     Net Sales -- Mattress  fabric  sales  (known as mattress  ticking)  for the
first quarter of fiscal 2005 decreased 4.7% to $26.0 million compared with $27.2
million for the same period a year ago. As noted above,  these results reflect a
13 week period versus a 14 week period last year.  Average  weekly sales for the
first quarter of fiscal 2005 were $2.0 million compared with $1.9 million in the
prior year  period,  an increase of 2.7%.  While sales,  on a comparable  basis,
continue  to be  affected  by the  recent  customers'  transition  to  one-sided
mattresses,  which utilize  one-third less fabric,  the mattress ticking segment
experienced higher sales, on an average weekly basis, by expanding business with
certain key accounts.  Also,  mattress  manufacturers  are  currently  incurring
higher  costs for other  mattress  components,  such as steel,  as well as costs
associated  with flame  retardant  requirements.  As a result of these increased
costs,  mattress  manufacturers  are  placing  additional  pressure  on mattress
ticking prices,  and in some instances  manufacturers are moving to lower priced
ticking.

Mattress  ticking  yards sold during the first  quarter of fiscal 2005 were 10.8
million  compared with 10.5 million yards in the first quarter of last year. The
average  selling  price was $2.38 per yard for the first  quarter,  compared  to
$2.57 per yard in the same quarter last year, a decrease of 7.4%.

     Operating  income -- For the first  quarter of fiscal  2005,  the  mattress
fabrics segment reported  operating  income of $2.9 million,  or 11.2% of sales,
compared  with $4.1  million,  or 15.2% of sales,  for the  prior  year  period.
Operating  income was  primarily  impacted by fewer  sales  weeks and  inventory
markdowns  related to certain customer  programs.  These factors are expected to
have significantly less impact on the segment's second quarter results.



     UPHOLSTERY FABRICS SEGMENT (See page 5 - Sales, Gross Profit and Operating
     Income (Loss) by Segment)

     Net Sales --  Upholstery  fabric sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2005
decreased  9.8% to $41.9  million when  compared to the first  quarter of fiscal
2004.  Average  weekly  sales for the  first  quarter  of fiscal  2005 were $3.2
million compared with $3.3 million in the prior year period, a decrease of 2.9%.
The lower sales primarily reflect soft demand by furniture retailers, as well as
current consumer preference for leather furniture and increased competition from
imported fabrics, including cut and sewn kits, primarily from Asia.

With the company's offshore sourcing efforts,  including the China platform, the
company is  experiencing  higher sales of upholstery  fabric  products  produced
outside of the company's U.S.  manufacturing  plants. These sales, which include
microdenier suedes and fabrics produced at the company's China plant,  increased
162% over the prior year period and accounted for approximately $5.5 million, or
13.1% of upholstery  fabric sales for the quarter.  Offshore  sourced fabrics of
$2.1 million accounted for approximately 4.5% of upholstery fabric sales for the
same period last year.

Upholstery  fabric yards sold during the first  quarter were 9.3 million  versus
10.6 million in the first  quarter of fiscal  2004, a decline of 12.3%.  Average
selling price was $4.25 per yard for the first  quarter  compared with $4.13 per
yard in the same  quarter  of last  year,  an  increase  of 2.9%,  due to higher
average selling prices in both the CDF and CVP divisions.

     Operating  income (loss) -- Operating  loss for the first quarter of fiscal
2005 was $2.6 million,  or 6.1% of sales,  compared with a loss of $1.7 million,
or 3.7% of sales, for the same period last year. The segment loss in each period
was  primarily  due to  underutilization  of the  company's  U.S.  manufacturing
capacity.  If sales  continue  to be under  pressure in the  upholstery  fabrics
segment,  management is prepared to take the necessary actions to further adjust
the company's cost structure and U.S. capacity,  as the company has demonstrated
in recent years.

     SG&A  EXPENSES -- SG&A  expenses of $9.3  million for the first  quarter of
fiscal 2005 decreased  approximately $1.2 million, or 11.8%, from the prior year
amount. As a percent of net sales,  SG&A expenses  decreased to 13.7% from 14.3%
the previous year, due mostly to lower professional fees.

     Unallocated Corporate Expenses - The unallocated corporate expense category
includes  certain items that have not been  allocated to the company's  segments
(see Page 5 - Sales and Gross  Profit/Operating  Income (Loss) by Segment).  The
major  components of unallocated  corporate  expenses  include  compensation and
benefits for certain executive  officers and all costs related to being a public
company.  For the first quarter of fiscal 2005,  unallocated  corporate expenses
totaled  $810,000  compared  with $1.5  million  for the same  period last year,
reflecting a substantial decrease in professional fees.

     INTEREST  EXPENSE AND  INTEREST  INCOME --  Interest  expense for the first
quarter  declined to $940,000  from $1.5 million the previous  year due to lower
borrowings  outstanding.  Interest income decreased to $27,000 from $122,000 the
previous year due to lower invested balances in fiscal 2005.

     INCOME TAXES -- The  effective  tax rate (taxes as a  percentage  of pretax
income  (loss))  for the first  quarter of fiscal 2005 was 34.0%  compared  with
37.0% for the same period last year.


BALANCE SHEET COMMENTS
- ----------------------

     CASH AND CASH  EQUIVALENTS - Cash and cash equivalents as of August 1, 2004
decreased  to $11.9  million  from  $14.6  million  at the end of  fiscal  2004,
primarily  reflecting  cash flow from  operations  of $2.4  million  and capital
expenditures  and  payments  on vendor  financed  capital  expenditures  of $5.0
million.

     WORKING CAPITAL -- Accounts  receivable as of August 1, 2004 increased 0.1%
from the year-earlier level. Days sales outstanding totaled 30 days at August 1,
2004  compared  with 32 days a year ago.  Inventories  at the close of the first
quarter  increased 5.7% from a year ago.  Inventory  turns for the first quarter
were 4.7 versus  5.0 for the  year-earlier  period.  Operating  working  capital
(comprised of accounts receivable and inventories,  less trade accounts payable)
was $61.5 million at August 1, 2004, up from $54.9 million a year ago.

     PROPERTY,  PLANT AND EQUIPMENT -- Capital spending for the first quarter of
fiscal  2005 was $4.5  million,  including  approximately  $3.9  million for the
purchase of a building that will serve as the  company's  new corporate  offices
and as new space for the  company's  showrooms.  The company  expects the annual
operating costs of the new building to be significantly lower than the lease and
related costs associated with the current facilities. Depreciation for the first
quarter was $3.4 million,  and is estimated at $13.5 million for the full fiscal
year.  For fiscal  2005,  the company  anticipates  capital  expenditures  to be
approximately $9.0 million, including the $5.7 million budgeted for the building
purchase and related renovations.

     INTANGIBLE  ASSETS -- As of August 1, 2004, $9.2 million in goodwill is the
company's  only  intangible  asset.  This  goodwill is comprised of $4.1 million
related to the mattress  fabrics  segment,  and $5.1 million related to the Culp
Decorative Fabrics division within the upholstery fabrics segment.

     LONG-TERM  DEBT  -- The  company's  long-term  debt  of  $51.1  million  is
unsecured and is comprised of $50.0 million in outstanding  senior notes, with a
fixed interest rate of 7.76%, and a $1.1 million, non-interest bearing term loan
with the  Canadian  government.  Additionally,  the company has a $15.0  million
revolving  credit line with a bank, of which no balance is outstanding at August
1, 2004.  The current bank  agreement,  which  expires in August 2004,  has been
extended to August  2005.  The first  scheduled  principal  payment on the $50.0
million  senior  notes is due  March  2006 in the  amount of $7.5  million.  The
Canadian  government  loan is  repaid in annual  installments  of  approximately
$500,000 per year. The company was in compliance with all financial covenants in
its loan agreements as of August 1, 2004.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS COMMENTS
- ----------------------------------

     Cash flow from  operations was $2.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal
2005,  compared  with $7.9 million for the same period last year.  This decrease
was primarily due to higher  inventory  balances and lower cash  generated  from
accounts  receivable  balances.  For the first quarter of fiscal 2005, cash flow
generated  from  operations,  as well as a portion of existing cash on hand, was
used for capital  expenditures,  most of which relate to the  building  purchase
described above.

BUSINESS OUTLOOK
- ----------------

Mattress  ticking  sales have  picked up during the early part of the  company's
second  quarter.  For the  current  quarter,  management  expects  sales in this
segment to be  moderately  ahead of second  quarter  sales last year and expects
that operating income will  approximate  last year's level.  With respect to the
upholstery  fabrics  segments,  the outlook  remains  uncertain  for a sustained
recovery in retail furniture business conditions.  Management is optimistic that
upholstery  fabric sales will also pickup in the fall, as is seasonally  typical
in the furniture  industry.  For the second quarter,  upholstery fabrics segment
sales are  expected to  decrease  less than the first  quarter  decline of 9.8%.
While  management  expects to be profitable in the upholstery  fabrics  segment,
operating income will be down considerably  from last year's second quarter.  At
this  time,  the  company  expects to report net income in the range of $0.13 to
$0.17 per share  diluted,  with the actual  results  depending  primarily on the
level of demand throughout the quarter.  Management believes that the excellence
in design  creativity,  the strength in the company's mattress ticking business,
the company's  aggressive  expansion of its' offshore sourcing  capabilities and
the  company's  sound  balance  sheet  effectively   position  Culp  in  today's
marketplace.
