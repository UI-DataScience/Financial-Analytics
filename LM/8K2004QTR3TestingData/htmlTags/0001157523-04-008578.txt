          Pier 1 Imports Reports Fiscal 2005 Second Quarter Earnings;
       Provides Sales and Earnings Guidance for Third and Fourth Quarters

     FORT WORTH, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 14, 2004--Pier 1 Imports, Inc.
(NYSE:PIR) today reported diluted earnings per share of $0.12 for the second
quarter ended Aug. 28, 2004, compared to $0.20 per diluted share for the
year-ago period. Net income was $10,446,000, compared to last year's net income
of $18,436,000. Sales for the second quarter were $452,271,000, a 5.7% increase
over last year's $427,831,000, and second quarter comparable store sales
declined 3.0%.
     For the six months ended Aug. 28, 2004, diluted earnings per share amounted
to $0.25, compared to $0.41 per diluted share for the year-ago period. Net
income for the six months was $22,183,000, compared to last year's $37,498,000
for the six-month period. Sales for the first six months of fiscal 2005 amounted
to $884,298,000, up 6.5% from $830,543,000 for the year-ago period. Comparable
store sales declined 2.4% for the six-month period.
     Third quarter total sales are projected to increase 4% to 9%, with
comparable store sales projected in a range of -4% to flat versus the year-ago
period. Third quarter projections for gross profit are in a range of 40.5% to
41.3% of sales versus 43.1% last year. Selling, general and administrative
expenses are projected to be in a range of 29.4% to 29.9% of sales, resulting in
diluted earnings per share projected in a range of $0.28 to $0.35 for the three
months ending Nov. 27, 2004. Fourth quarter total sales are projected to
increase 3% to 9%, with comparable store sales in a range of -5% to +1% versus
the year-ago period. Diluted earnings per share are projected to be in a range
of $0.52 to $0.62 for the three months ending Feb. 26, 2005. As a result, fiscal
year 2005 diluted earnings per share are projected to be in a range of $1.05 to
$1.22.
     Marvin J. Girouard, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
commented, "Although this has proven to be a difficult year for our company, we
believe that the current initiatives in merchandising, marketing and stores have
begun to take effect. This should result in improved sales and earnings
performance as we progress through the second half of this year and into our
next fiscal year. While we are operating in an environment of economic
uncertainty, we believe that by offering customers unique merchandise at a value
and providing outstanding customer service, we will drive traffic into our
stores and increase Pier 1's market share. We continue to evaluate all costs,
especially marketing expenditures. This fall, our marketing program will
primarily include newspaper inserts, national magazine advertising, direct
marketing, and e-commerce marketing through Pier1.com. In early October, we plan
to name a new advertising agency.
     "We have a strong balance sheet with $100 million of cash at the end of the
second quarter. Through the first six months of fiscal 2005, we repurchased 2.4
million shares, or $43.0 million of Pier 1 Common Stock, with $126.7 million
remaining in our share repurchase program."
     The Company will host a conference call to discuss fiscal 2005 second
quarter earnings including third and fourth quarter projections at 10:00 a.m.
Central Time today. A web cast is available on our web site at www.pier1.com
linking through to the "Investor Relations" page and the "Events" page, or you
can dial into the conference at 706-643-0435, ID 5459387. The teleconference
will be held in a "listen-only" mode for all participants other than the
Company's current sell-side and buy-side investment professionals.

     Any forward-looking projections or statements made in this press release
should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements contained in
the Company's most recently filed Form 10-Q for fiscal year 2005. Management's
expectations and assumptions regarding planned store openings, financing of
Company obligations from operations, results from its new marketing,
merchandising and store operations strategies, and other future results are
subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations
expressed in the forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that may
affect Company operations and performance include, among others, the effects of
terrorist attacks or other acts of war, conflicts or war involving the United
States or its allies or trading partners, labor strikes, weather conditions that
may affect sales, volatility of fuel and utility costs, the general strength of
the economy and levels of consumer spending, consumer confidence, the
availability of new sites for expansion along with sufficient labor to
facilitate growth, the strength of new home construction and sales of existing
homes, the availability and proper functioning of technology and communications
systems supporting the Company's key business processes, the ability of the
Company to import merchandise from foreign countries without significantly
restrictive tariffs, duties or quotas and the ability of the Company to source,
ship and deliver items from foreign countries to its U.S. distribution centers
at reasonable prices and rates and in a timely fashion.
     The Company assumes no obligation to update or revise its forward-looking
statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected
results expressed or implied will not be realized.
