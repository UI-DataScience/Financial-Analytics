Hi-Tech Pharmacal Reports a 31% Sales Increase for the Quarter Ended July 31,
2004

AMITYVILLE, N.Y. - September 8, 2004 - Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co., Inc.
(NASDAQ: HITK) today reported results for the quarter ended July 31, 2004.

Net sales for the three months ended July 31, 2004 were $12,140,000, an increase
of $2,876,000 or 31% as compared to the net sales for the three months ended
July 31, 2003 of $9,264,000.

Net sales for generic pharmaceutical products, for the three months ended July
31, 2004 were $10,690,000, an increase of $2,286,000, or 27%, compared to the
fiscal 2004 respective period sales of $8,404,000. The increase was primarily
due to strong sales of Urea 40% Cream and Lotion, the introduction of Ofloxacin
Ophthalmic Solution in May and the recent acquisition of Naprelan(R) in June.

Net sales for the Health Care Products division, which markets the Company's
branded products, were $1,450,000, an increase of $590,000 or 69%, compared to
$860,000 reported for the same period last year. The increase was primarily
caused by increased sales of DiabetiDerm(R) products. Additionally, in the prior
period, sales in the Health Care Products division were adversely affected by
higher than usual product returns.

Cost of sales increased to $5,925,000, 49% of net sales, for the three months
ended July 31, 2004 from $4,516,000, 49% of net sales, for the three months
ended July 31, 2003.

Research and product development costs for the three months ended July 31, 2004
increased to $1,088,000, or 9% of net sales compared to $563,000 or 6% of net
sales for the same period ended July 31, 2003 primarily due to expenditures on
development of a steroidal nasal spray. Management expects research and
development costs to run approximately 7% to 9% of expected net sales this
fiscal year as the Company continues to emphasize spending on the development of
new products.

Selling, general and administrative expense increased to $3,827,000, 32% of net
sales, from $2,946,000, 32% of net sales, for the three months ended July 31,
2004 and 2003. This was primarily the result of increased commission expenses
associated with the introduction of new products, ongoing expenses related to
the Tussi 12 D S litigation, initial spending on Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404
compliance, amortization of intangibles related to the Naprelan(R) license
agreement and one time expenses incurred in connection with a potential
acquisition that management decided not to pursue.

Net income for the three months ended July 31, 2004 and 2003 was $869,000 and
$953,000, respectively, a decrease of $84,000, or 9%. Fully diluted earnings per
share decreased to $.10 per share for the three months ended July 31, 2004 from
$.11 for the three months ended July 31, 2003. The decrease is due to lower net
income for the current period and an increase in the number of shares
outstanding primarily resulting from the private placement of the Company's
common stock conducted in July 2003.

David Seltzer, President and CEO, commented on the quarter: "We are pleased with
our financial results for the first quarter. Our generic business, led by our
Urea 40% line, remains strong. In addition our sales were positively impacted by
the successful introduction of our Ofloxacin Opthalmic Solution, as well as
sales of recently acquired Naprelan(R). We are also pleased with the results of
our Health Care Products division which showed a dramatic increase in sales
driven by the company's DiabetiDerm(R) line.

"While our net income was slightly lower for the quarter, it was primarily the
result of increased Research and Development spending. We believe that we are
taking the correct steps by staying fully committed to enhancing our pipeline of
products in development, as we undertake more challenging projects. Our growing
portfolio of liquid generic products will drive our company's growth in the
future."

Hi-Tech currently has seven products awaiting approval at the FDA. These
products target brand sales of over $300 million. In addition to these products
awaiting approval at the FDA, Hi-Tech has twenty products in active development
targeting brand sales of over $2.0 billion, including sterile ophthalmic
products, oral solutions and suspensions and nasal sprays.

The Company's management reiterates its belief that net sales will grow between
15% and 20% for Fiscal Year 2005. The Company's ability to meet the forecast
depends on such factors as the timing of new product launches, competition,
legal proceedings and other market conditions.

Hi-Tech is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing, manufacturing and
marketing branded and generic prescription and OTC products for the general
healthcare industry. The Company specializes in difficult to manufacture liquid
and semi-solid dosage forms and produces a range of sterile ophthalmic, otic and
inhalation products. The Company's Health Care Products Division is a leading
developer and marketer of branded prescription and OTC products for the diabetes
marketplace.
