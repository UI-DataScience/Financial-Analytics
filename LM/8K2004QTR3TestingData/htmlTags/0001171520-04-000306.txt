Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition

      On August 13, 2004, Franklin Street Properties Corp. ("FSP Corp." or the
"Registrant"), a Maryland corporation, four wholly-owned acquisition
subsidiaries of FSP Corp., each a Delaware corporation (the "Acquisition Subs"),
and four real estate investment trusts, each a Delaware corporation (the "Target
REITs"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"),
providing for (i) FSP Corp.'s acquisition of each of the Target REITs by merging
each Target REIT into a related Acquisition Sub, resulting in the Acquisition
Sub being the surviving corporation and (ii) the issuance of approximately
10,894,994 shares of FSP Corp. Common Stock as consideration in connection with
the mergers. Upon consummation of the mergers, the holders of the preferred
stock of the preferred stock of the Target REITs will become stockholders of FSP
Corp.

      Pursuant to the requirements of Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X, this Current
Report on Form 8-K includes a Statement of Revenues over Certain Operating
Expenses for FSP Addison Circle Corp., FSP Collins Crossing Corp., FSP Montague
Business Center Corp., and FSP Royal Ridge Corp. for the six months ended June
30, 2004 (unaudited) and for the three years ended December 31, 2003 or, in the
case of FSP Royal Ridge Corp., for the two years ended December 31, 2003, as
well as pro forma financial information for FSP Corp. and the acquisition of 13
real estate investment trusts completed by FSP Corp. in June 2003. Because
changes will likely occur in occupancy, rents and expenses experienced by the
Target REITs and because the merger may not be completed, the historical
financial statements and pro forma financial data presented should not be
considered as a projection of future results.

      In connection with the mergers, the Registrant is hereby filing as part of
this Current Report on Form 8-K the financial statements and pro forma financial
statements set forth below under Item 9.01.

      Upon consummation of the mergers, the Registrant expects to file a Current
Report under Item 2.01 of Form 8-K, "Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of
Assets," reporting the information required to be set forth therein.

                           FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS

THIS FORM 8-K CONTAINS FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE
PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 AND THE FEDERAL SECURITIES
LAWS. THESE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED UPON FSP CORP.'S CURRENT
BELIEFS AND EXPECTATIONS, BUT THEY ARE NOT GUARANTEED. FOR EXAMPLE, THE REVENUE
IN EXCESS OF OPERATING EXPENSES MAY BE LESS THAN CURRENTLY EXPECTED DUE TO
CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS, INCREASED EXPENSES OR FOR OTHER REASONS. ALSO,
VARIOUS CLOSING CONDITIONS UNDER THE MERGER AGREEMENTS MAY NOT BE SATISFIED AND
THE ACQUISITION MAY NOT BE COMPLETED. INVESTORS ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE
RELIANCE UPON FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS.

  NOTES ACCOMPANYING THE STATEMENTS OF REVENUE OVER CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES
                                   (unaudited)


1.    DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPERTY:

      The accompanying statements of revenue over certain operating expenses
      (the "Statements") include the operations of a recently constructed
      ten-story Class "A" suburban office tower containing approximately 293,787
      rentable square feet located on approximately 3.62 acres of land in
      Addison, Dallas County, Texas (the "Property"). The subject property was
      purchased by Champion Addison One, LP as a vacant tract of land on
      November 11, 1997. On September 30, 2002, Champion Addison One, LP sold
      the property to FSP Addison Circle Corp. (the "Company").

2.    BASIS OF ACCOUNTING:

      The accompanying Statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of
      accounting. The Statements have been prepared in accordance with Rule 3-14
      of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission for real
      estate properties acquired or to be acquired. Accordingly, these
      Statements exclude certain historical expenses not comparable to the
      operations of the Property after acquisition such as amortization,
      depreciation, interest, corporate expenses and certain other costs not
      directly related to the future operations of the Property.

3.    USE OF ESTIMATES:

      The preparation of the Statements in conformity with the basis of
      accounting described in Note 2 requires management to make estimates and
      assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
      during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
      estimates.

4.    CONCENTRATIONS OF RISKS:

      For the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, rental income was
      received from various lessees. As such, future receipts are dependent upon
      the financial strength of the lessees and their ability to perform under
      the lease agreements.

5.    LEASES:

      The Company, as lessor, has minimum future rentals due under a
      noncancellable operating leases as follows:

                     Year Ending
                     December 31,         Amount
                     ------------      ------------

                         2004          $  3,342,000
                         2005             6,636,000
                         2006             5,698,000
                         2007             3,101,000
                         2008             2,369,000
                      Thereafter            943,000
                                       ------------

                                       $ 22,089,000
                                       ============

      In addition, the lessees are liable for real estate taxes and operating
      expenses as direct expenses to the lessees.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


To the Stockholders
FSP Addison Circle Corp.


We have audited the accompanying statements of revenue over certain operating
expenses (the "Statements") of FSP Addison Circle Corp. for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001. These Statements are the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
Statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Statements
are free of material misstatements. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the Statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall Statements'
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

The accompanying Statements were prepared to comply with the requirements of
Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and
exclude certain expenses described in Note 2, and therefore, are not intended to
be a complete presentation of the Property's revenue and expenses.

In our opinion, these Statements referred to above presents fairly, in all
material respects, the revenue over certain operating expenses (as described in
Note 2), of FSP Addison Circle Corp. for the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002, and 2001, in conformity with the basis of accounting described in Note 2.

      The accompanying statements of revenue over certain operating expenses
      (the "Statements") include the operations of a recently constructed

      rentable square feet located on approximately 3.62 acres of land in
      Addison, Dallas County, Texas (the "Property"). The subject property was
      purchased by Champion Addison One, LP as a vacant tract of land on
      November 11, 1997. On September 30, 2002, Champion Addison One, LP sold
      the property to FSP Addison Circle Corp. (the "Company").

2.    BASIS OF ACCOUNTING:

      The accompanying Statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of
      accounting. The Statements have been prepared in accordance with Rule 3-14
      of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission for real
      estate properties acquired or to be acquired. Accordingly, these
      Statements exclude certain historical expenses not comparable to the
      operations of the Property after acquisition such as amortization,
      depreciation, interest, corporate expenses and certain other costs not
      directly related to the future operations of the Property.

3.    REVENUE RECOGNITION:

      Rental revenue includes income from leases, certain reimbursable expenses,
      straight-line rent adjustments and other income associated with renting
      the property. A summary of rental revenue is shown in the following table:

                                                  Year Ended December 31,

                                          ----------    ----------    ----------

      Income from leases                  $7,152,563    $7,230,163    $7,168,574
      Straight-line rent adjustment          321,385       358,091       293,420
      Reimbursable expenses                1,080,115     1,092,574       887,543
      Other income                            25,446         1,359         4,253
                                          ----------    ----------    ----------

         Total                            $8,579,509    $8,682,187    $8,353,790
                                          ==========    ==========    ==========


      The Company has retained substantially all of the risks and benefits of
      the property and accounts for its leases as operating leases. Rental
      income from leases, which include rent concessions (including free rent
      and tenant improvement allowances) and scheduled increases in rental rates
      during the lease term, is recognized on a straight-line basis. The Company
      does not have any percentage rent arrangements with its tenants.
      Reimbursable costs are included in rental income in the period earned.

4.    USE OF ESTIMATES:

      The preparation of the Statements in conformity with the basis of
      accounting described in Note 2 requires management to make estimates and
      assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
      during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
      estimates.

5.    CONCENTRATIONS OF RISKS:

      For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, rental income was
      received from various lessees. As such, future receipts are dependent upon
      the financial strength of the lessees and their ability to perform under
      the lease agreements.

1.    DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPERTY:

      The accompanying statements of revenue over certain operating expenses
      (the "Statements") include the operations of a commercial building located
      in Dallas County, Texas (the "Property"). The Property is an eleven-story
      Class "A" institutional quality suburban office tower containing
      approximately 298,766 square feet of rentable space. The Property was
      owned by Collins Crossing Limited Partnership and sold to FSP Collins
      Crossing Corp. (the "Company") on March 3, 2003.

2.    BASIS OF ACCOUNTING:

      The accompanying Statement have been prepared on the accrual basis of
      accounting. The Statements have been prepared in accordance with Rule 3-14
      of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission for real
      estate properties acquired or to be acquired. Accordingly, these
      Statements exclude certain historical expenses not comparable to the
      operations of the Property after acquisition such as amortization,
      depreciation, interest, corporate expenses and certain other costs not
      directly related to future operations of the Property.

3.    USE OF ESTIMATES:

      The preparation of the Statements in conformity with the basis of
      accounting described in Note 2 requires management to make estimates and
      assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
      during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
      estimates.

4.    CONCENTRATIONS OF RISKS:

      For the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, rental income was from
      three lessees. As such, future receipts are dependent upon the financial
      strength of these lessees and their ability to perform under the lease
      agreements.

5.    LEASES:

      The Company, as lessor, has minimum future rentals due under
      noncancellable operating leases as follows:

                     Year Ending

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


To the Stockholders
FSP Collins Crossing Corp.


We have audited the accompanying statements of revenue over certain operating
expenses (the "Statements") of FSP Collins Crossing Corp. for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. These Statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
Statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Statements
are free of material misstatements. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the Statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall Statements'
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

The accompanying Statements were prepared to comply with the requirements of
Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and
exclude certain expenses described in Note 2 and, therefore, are not intended to
be a complete presentation of the Property's revenue and expenses.

In our opinion, these Statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the revenue over certain operating expenses (as described in
Note 2), of FSP Collins Crossing Corp. for the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, in conformity with the basis of accounting described in Note 2.

                           FSP COLLINS CROSSING CORP.
  NOTES ACCOMPANYING THE STATEMENTS OF REVENUE OVER CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES


1.    DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPERTY:

      The accompanying statements of revenue over certain operating expenses
      (the "Statements") include the operations of a commercial building located
      in Dallas County, Texas (the "Property"). The Property is an eleven-story
      Class "A" institutional quality suburban office tower containing
      approximately 298,766 square feet of rentable space. The Property was
      owned by Collins Crossing Limited Partnership and sold to FSP Collins
      Crossing Corp. (the "Company") on March 3, 2003.

2.    BASIS OF ACCOUNTING:

      The Statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting. The
      Statements have been prepared in accordance with Rule 3-14 of Regulation
      S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission for real estate properties
      acquired or to be acquired. Accordingly, these Statements exclude certain
      historical expenses not comparable to the operations of the Property after
      acquisition such as amortization, depreciation, interest, corporate
      expenses and certain other costs not directly related to future operations
      of the Property.

3.    REVENUE RECOGNITION:

      Rental revenue includes income from leases, certain reimbursable expenses,
      and straight-line rent adjustments associated with renting the property.

                                                   Year Ended December 31,
                                               2003         2002         2001
                                            ----------   ----------   ----------

      Income from leases                    $6,822,916   $6,747,319   $6,415,650
      Straight-line rent adjustment            332,181      294,140      252,620
      Reimbursable expenses                    655,790      678,002      563,547
                                            ----------   ----------   ----------

         Total                              $7,810,887   $7,719,461   $7,231,817
                                            ==========   ==========   ==========

      The Company has retained substantially all of the risks and benefits of
      the Property and accounts for its leases as operating leases. Rental
      income from leases, which includes rent concessions (including free rent
      and tenant improvement allowances) and scheduled increases in rental rates
      during the lease term, is recognized on a straight-line basis. The Company
      does not have any percentage rent arrangements with its tenants.
      Reimbursable costs are included in rental income in the period earned.

4.    USE OF ESTIMATES:

      The preparation of the Statements in conformity with the basis of
      accounting described in Note 2 requires management to make estimates and
      assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
      during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
      estimates.

5.    CONCENTRATIONS OF RISKS:

      For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, rental income was
      from three lessees. As such, future receipts are dependent upon the
      financial strength of these lessees and their ability to perform under the
      lease agreements.

1.    DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPERTY:

      The accompanying statements of revenue over certain operating expenses
      (the "Statements") include the operations of a commercial building located
      in San Jose, California (the "Property"). The Property consists of two
      adjacent single-story Class "A" suburban office buildings containing
      145,951 square feet located on 9.95 acres of land. The Property was owned
      by Teacher's Insurance and Annuity Association of America and TlAA Realty,
      Inc. and sold to FSP Montague Business Center Corp (the "Company") on
      August 27, 2002.

2.    BASIS OF ACCOUNTING:

      The accompanying statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of
      accounting. The Statements have been prepared in accordance with Rule 3-14
      of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission for real
      estate properties acquired or to be acquired. Accordingly, these
      Statements exclude certain historical expenses not comparable to the
      operations of the Property after acquisition such as amortization,
      depreciation, interest, corporate expenses and certain other costs not
      directly related to future operations of the Property.

3.    USE OF ESTIMATES:

      The preparation of the Statements in conformity with the basis of
      accounting described in Note 2 requires management to make estimates and
      assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
      during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
      estimates.

4.    CONCENTRATIONS OF RISKS:

      For the six months ended June 30, 2004, and 2003, rental income was from
      various lessees. As such, future receipts are dependent upon the financial
      strength of the lessees and their ability to perform under the lease
      agreements.

5.    LEASES:

      The Company, as lessor, has minimum future rentals due under
      noncancellable operating leases as follows:

                       Year Ending
                       December 31,          Amount

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


To the Stockholders
FSP Montague Business Center Corp.


We have audited the accompanying statements of revenue over certain operating
expenses (the "Statement") of FSP Montague Business Center Corp. for the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. These Statements are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these Statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Statements
are free of material misstatements. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the Statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall Statements'
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

The accompanying Statements were prepared to comply with the requirements of
Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and
exclude certain expenses described in Note 2 and, therefore, are not intended to
be a complete presentation of the Property's revenue and expenses.

In our opinion, these Statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the revenue over certain operating expenses (as described in
Note 2) of FSP Montague Business Center Corp. for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, in conformity with the basis of accounting described in
Note 2.

  NOTES ACCOMPANYING THE STATEMENTS OF REVENUE OVER CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES


1.    DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPERTY:

      The accompanying statements of revenue over certain operating expenses
      (the "Statements") include the operations of a commercial building located
      in San Jose, California (the "Property"). The Property consists of two
      adjacent single-story Class "A" suburban office buildings containing
      145,951 square feet located on 9.95 acres of land. The Property was owned
      by Teacher's Insurance and Annuity Association of America and TIAA Realty,
      Inc. and sold to FSP Montague Business Center Corp (the "Company") on
      August 27, 2002.

2.    BASIS OF ACCOUNTING:

      The accompanying statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of
      accounting. The Statements have been prepared in accordance with Rule 3-14
      of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission for real
      estate properties acquired or to be acquired. Accordingly, these
      Statements exclude certain historical expenses not comparable to the
      operations of the Property after acquisition such as amortization,
      depreciation, interest, corporate expenses and certain other costs not
      directly related to future operations of the Property.

3.    REVENUE RECOGNITION:

      Rental revenue includes income from leases, certain reimbursable expenses,
      straight-line rent adjustments and other income associated with renting
      the property. A summary of rental revenue is shown in the following table:

                                                   Year Ended December 31,
                                               2003         2002         2001
                                            ----------   ----------   ----------

      Income from leases                    $3,788,888   $3,472,106   $2,731,934
      Straight-line rent adjustment            262,263      375,540      679,196
      Reimbursable expenses                    745,269      503,350      411,195
      Other income                              11,163       11,163           --
                                            ----------   ----------   ----------
          Total                             $4,807,583   $4,362,159   $3,822,325
                                            ==========   ==========   ==========

      The Company has retained substantially all of the risks and benefits of
      the Property and accounts for its leases as operating leases. Rental
      income from leases, which includes rent concessions (including free rent
      and tenant improvement allowances) and scheduled increases in rental rates
      during the lease term, is recognized on a straight-line basis. The Company
      does not have any percentage rent arrangements with its tenants.
      Reimbursable costs are included in rental income in the period earned.

4.    USE OF ESTIMATES:

      The preparation of the Statements in conformity with the basis of
      accounting described in Note 2 requires management to make estimates and
      assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
      during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
      estimates.

5.    CONCENTRATIONS OF RISKS:

      For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, rental income was
      from various lessees. As such, future receipts are dependent upon the
      financial strength of the lessees and their ability to perform under the
      lease agreements.

  NOTES ACCOMPANYING THE STATEMENTS OF REVENUE OVER CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES
                                   (unaudited)


1.    DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPERTY:

      The accompanying statements of revenue over certain operating expenses
      (the "Statements") include the operations of a commercial building located
      in Alpharetta, Georgia (the "Property"). The Property is a recently
      constructed six-story Class "A" institutional quality suburban office
      tower containing approximately 161,366 square feet of rentable space
      completed in December 2001. The Property was owned by CK Royal 400, LLC
      and sold to FSP Royal Ridge Corp. (the "Company") on January 30, 2003.

2.    BASIS OF ACCOUNTING:

      The accompanying Statement have been prepared on the accrual basis of
      accounting. The Statements have been prepared in accordance with Rule 3-14
      of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission for real
      estate properties acquired or to be acquired. Accordingly, these
      Statements exclude certain historical expenses not comparable to the
      operations of the Property after acquisition such as amortization,
      depreciation, interest, corporate expenses and certain other costs not
      directly related to future operations of the Property.

3.    USE OF ESTIMATES:

      The preparation of the Statements in conformity with the basis of
      accounting described in Note 2 requires management to make estimates and
      assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
      during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
      estimates.

4.    CONCENTRATIONS OF RISKS:

      For the six months ended June 30, 2004, and 2003, rental income was
      received from three lessees. As such, future receipts are dependent upon
      the financial strength of these lessees and their ability to perform under
      the lease agreements.

5.    LEASES:

      The Company, as lessor, has minimum future rentals due under
      noncancellable operating leases as follows:

                     Year Ending
                     December 31,         Amount
                     ------------     ------------

                         2006            2,071,000

                      Thereafter         6,750,000
                                      ------------

                                      ============

      In addition, the lessees are liable for real estate taxes and operating
      expenses as direct expenses to the lessees.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


To the Stockholders
FSP Royal Ridge Corp.


We have audited the accompanying statements of revenue over certain operating
expenses (the "Statements") of FSP Royal Ridge Corp. for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002. These Statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
Statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Statements
are free of material misstatements. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the Statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall Statements'
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

The accompanying Statements were prepared to comply with the requirements of
Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and
exclude certain expenses described in Note 2 and, therefore, are not intended to
be a complete presentation of the Property's revenue and expenses.

In our opinion, these Statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the revenue over certain operating expenses (as described in
Note 2) of FSP Royal Ridge Corp. for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,
in conformity with the basis of accounting described in Note 2.

  NOTES ACCOMPANYING THE STATEMENTS OF REVENUE OVER CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES

1.    DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPERTY:

      The accompanying statements of revenue over certain operating expenses
      (the "Statements") include the operations of a commercial building located
      in Alpharetta, Georgia (the "Property"). The Property is a recently
      constructed six-story Class "A" institutional quality suburban office
      tower containing approximately 161,366 square feet of rentable space
      completed in December 2001. The Property was owned by CK Royal 400, LLC
      and sold to FSP Royal Ridge Corp. (the "Company") on January 30, 2003.

2.    BASIS OF ACCOUNTING:

      The accompanying Statement have been prepared on the accrual basis of
      accounting. The Statements have been prepared in accordance with Rule 3-14
      of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission for real
      estate properties acquired or to be acquired. Accordingly, these
      Statements exclude certain historical expenses not comparable to the
      operations of the Property after acquisition such as amortization,
      depreciation, interest, corporate expenses and certain other costs not
      directly related to future operations of the Property.

3.    REVENUE RECOGNITION:

      Rental revenue includes income from leases, certain reimbursable expenses,
      and straight-line rent adjustments associated with renting the property. A
      summary of rental revenue is shown in the following table:

                                           Year Ended December 31,
                                            2003            2002
                                         ----------      ----------
      Income from leases                 $1,152,591      $       --
      Straight-line rent adjustment         954,172              --

                                         ----------      ----------

        Total                            $2,693,318      $    3,084
                                         ==========      ==========

      The Company has retained substantially all of the risks and benefits of
      the Property and accounts for its leases as operating leases. Rental
      income from leases, which includes rent concessions (including free rent
      and tenant improvement allowances) and scheduled increases in rental rates
      during the lease term, is recognized on a straight-line basis. The Company
      does not have any percentage rent arrangements with its tenants.
      Reimbursable costs are included in rental income in the period earned.

4.    USE OF ESTIMATES:

      The preparation of the Statements in conformity with the basis of
      accounting described in Note 2 requires management to make estimates and
      assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
      during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
      estimates.

5.    CONCENTRATIONS OF RISKS:

      For the years ended December 31, 2003, and 2002, rental income was
      received from three lessees. As such, future receipts are dependent upon
      the financial strength of these lessees and their ability to perform under
      the lease agreements.

Basis of Presentation

      The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial
statement presentation has been prepared based upon certain pro forma
adjustments to the historical consolidated financial statements of FSP Corp. The
pro forma balance sheets are presented as if the mergers occurred as of June 30,
2004. The pro forma statements of income are presented as if the mergers
occurred as of the beginning of the period.

      The mergers will be treated as a purchase of assets and each Target REIT's
assets and liabilities will be recorded on FSP Corp.'s books at their fair value
as of the effective date of the mergers.

                              PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

      Certain assumptions regarding the operations of FSP Corp. have been made
in connection with the preparation of the pro forma condensed consolidated
financial information. These assumptions are as follows:

      (a)   FSP Corp. and each of the Target REITs have elected to be, and are
            qualified as, a real estate investment trust for federal income tax
            purposes. Each entity has met the various required tests; therefore,
            no provision for federal or state income taxes have been reflected
            on real estate operations.


      (b)   FSP Corp. has subsidiaries which are not in the business of real
            estate operations. Those subsidiaries are taxable as real estate
            investment trust subsidiaries (each, a "TRS") and are subject to
            income taxes at regular tax rates. The taxes on income shown in the
            pro forma statements of operations are the taxes on income incurred
            by the TRS. There are no material items that would cause a deferred
            tax asset or a deferred tax liability.

                                   (Unaudited)


      (c)   The costs of the mergers to FSP Corp. are estimated at $500,000 and
            are reflected as paid as of June 30, 2004 and are capitalized to the
            assets acquired.

      (d)   The cost of the property (including capitalized merger costs of
            $500,000) has been allocated to real estate investments, acquired
            lease origination costs and acquired favorable leases. Acquired
            lease origination costs represent the value associated with
            acquiring an in-place lease (i.e. the market cost to execute a
            similar lease, including leasing commission, legal, vacancy and
            other related costs). Acquired favorable leases represents the value
            associated with a lease which has a rental stream with above market
            rates. The value assigned to buildings land and to leases
            approximates their fair value.

            The following schedule shows the allocation of the aggregate cost of
            the properties based upon appraised values. Depreciation and
            amortization for the Target REITs is based on a preliminary
            allocation of the purchase price to real estate investments and to
            the leases acquired. The allocation is subject to change as
            additional information is obtained. An increase in the allocation to
            lease origination costs will result in an increase in amortization
            expense. For each $1,000,000 increase in lease origination costs,
            the related pro forma amortization expense will increase by
            approximately $200,000 per year.
