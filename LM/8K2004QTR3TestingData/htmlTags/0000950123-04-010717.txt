FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            MOVADO GROUP, INC. REPORTS STRONG SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
      ~ COMPANY POSTS 28% SALES GAIN OVER LY, INCLUDING EBEL ACQUISITION ~

         PARAMUS, NJ - SEPTEMBER 8, 2004 -- MOVADO GROUP, INC. (NYSE: MOV),
today announced second quarter results for the period ended July 31, 2004. These
results include the Ebel business, which was acquired on March 1, 2004. All
share data has been adjusted to reflect a two-for-one stock split distributed to
shareholders on June 25, 2004.

SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2005

o    Net sales increased 27.8% to $97.8 million from $76.5 million last year.
     The acquisition of Ebel accounted for net sales of $9.4 million.

o    Comparable store sales increased 11.8% at the Company's Movado boutiques.

o    Gross margin was 59.3% this year compared to 61.7% last year. The
     acquisition of Ebel had a negative effect on gross margins in the second
     quarter of fiscal 2005 of approximately 0.7%.

o    Operating profit was $8.7 million versus $8.8 million in the year-ago
     period. The acquisition of Ebel resulted in a $1.7 million decrease in
     operating profit in the second quarter of fiscal 2005.

o    Net income was $7.1 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to net
     income of $5.8 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the prior year
     period. Second quarter net income includes the dilutive impact of Ebel,
     which was partially offset by the previously announced gain of $835,000, or
     $0.03 per diluted share, associated with a legal settlement the Company
     reached with Swiss Army Brands. The combined effect of these two items
     reduced net income in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 by approximately
     $500,000, or $0.02 per diluted share.

FIRST HALF FISCAL 2005

o    Net sales increased 25.8% to $172.0 million from $136.7 million last year.
     The acquisition of Ebel accounted for net sales of $12.8 million.

o    Comparable store sales increased 18.4% at the Company's Movado boutiques.

o    Gross margin was 58.9% compared to 61.2%. The acquisition of Ebel had a
     negative effect on gross margins in the first half of fiscal 2005 of
     approximately 0.8%.

o    Operating profit was $10.5 million versus $10.8 million in the year-ago
     period. The acquisition of Ebel resulted in a $4.1 million decrease in
     operating profit in the first half of fiscal 2005.

o    Net income was $7.8 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to net
     income of $6.6 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in the prior year
     period. Net income for the first half of fiscal 2005 includes the dilutive
     impact of Ebel, which was partially offset by the aforementioned gain
     associated with a legal settlement the Company reached with Swiss Army
     Brands during the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The combined effect of
     these two items reduced net income in the first half of fiscal 2005 by
     approximately $2.3 million, or $0.09 per diluted share.

         Efraim Grinberg, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Our
solid results during the second quarter reflect strength across our brands,
geographic regions, and channels of business. Movado boutiques continue to gain
traction, with double-digit comparable store sales increases posted in the
second quarter. Our overall success continues to be driven by the execution of
our strategy to support our brands with innovative advertising campaigns, to
deliver unique and compelling product assortments, and to maintain an intense
focus on our customers."

         Mr. Grinberg continued, "The integration and revitalization of the Ebel
brand continues and we are encouraged by our progress thus far. We are looking
forward to the important second half of the year when our customers will begin
to see the impact of our efforts to-date. On the advertising front, we have
launched a powerful image-building global campaign featuring internationally
recognized supermodel, Claudia Schiffer. This campaign, along with a new Ebel
men's campaign, has a prominent presence in the key fall fashion publications.
We also expect Ebel to benefit from exciting new products and refined marketing
programs we have planned for the second half of the year, which represent a
return to the successful roots of the brand and truly convey the luxury image
and rich heritage of Ebel."

         Rick Cote, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer,
stated, "Our business is strong, and we are poised for growth across all areas
of our organization. We continue to be focused on the fundamentals of our
business and our investments are bearing fruit. Throughout the first half of
this year, top line initiatives including product development efforts, marketing
and advertising, drove consumer interest and translated into strong sales gains.
These efforts were supported and enhanced by our efficient operating

structure, allowing us to generate strong bottom line results, despite the
planned dilutive impact of the Ebel acquisition. Additionally, our strong
balance sheet and focus on cash flow management ensure we have the ability to
continue to appropriately invest across all of our businesses and capitalize on
growth initiatives."

          The Company anticipates diluted earnings per share for the full year
to range between $0.95 and $1.00, including the dilutive impact of Ebel and the
legal settlement gain. The Company plans fiscal year 2005 sales to be
approximately $410 million, an increase in excess of 20% from last year,
including sales from Ebel which are now projected to range between $40 million
and $45 million.

         The Company's management will host a conference call today, September
8th at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. A live broadcast of the call will be available
on the Company's website: www.movadogroupinc.com. This call will be archived
