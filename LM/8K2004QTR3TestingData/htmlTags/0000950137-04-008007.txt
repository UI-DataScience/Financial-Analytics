                   OUTLOOK GROUP REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS

NEENAH, WIS., SEPTEMBER 22, 2004.....Outlook Group Corp. (Nasdaq: OUTL) today
reported net sales of $17,207,000 for the first quarter ended August 28, 2004,
an increase from sales of $17,061,000 for the first quarter of the prior year.
Net earnings were $703,000 or $0.21 per diluted share for the first quarter of
fiscal 2005, compared to a net loss of $207,000 or ($0.06) per diluted share for
the same period in the prior year.

"We continued our steady improvement in the first quarter. Among other factors,
the significant increase in earnings reflected the gains in production
efficiency we are realizing as a result of the investments we made last year in
new equipment and training for several major long-term projects. We also
completed a number of profitable one-time projects in the first quarter," said
Joseph J. Baksha, president and chief operating officer of Outlook Group.

"Although the industry environment continues to be very challenging, our
strategy to differentiate Outlook Group by offering a complete portfolio of
supply chain management solutions has proven to be very successful. We added
several new long-term agreements in the first quarter, including a five-year
agreement for the production of Cool Qube(TM) high-end tissue boxes developed by
Trinova Design," said Baksha. "Including the new business, long-term agreements
now account for approximately 75% of our total annualized sales."

Baksha said that while the company's focus is on supply chain management
solutions, printing continues to be a foundation of the business. "Our high
quality printing capabilities were recently recognized by the `Benny' we
received in the 2004 Premier Print Awards for our new corporate capabilities
brochure. This is the graphic arts industry's largest and most prestigious
worldwide print competition," he noted.
