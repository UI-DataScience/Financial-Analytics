 quarter that ended on July 31, 2004 .  A copy of the press release is

                         Forward-Looking Information
                         ---------------------------

 This current report on Form 8-K contains, and future oral and written
 statements may contain, forward-looking statements within the meaning of
 such term in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with
 respect to the Company's business, financial condition, results of
 operations, plans, objectives and future performance.  Forward-looking
 statements, which may be based upon beliefs, expectations and assumptions
 of management and on information currently available to management, are
 generally identifiable by the use of words such as "believe," "expect,"
 "anticipate," "plan," "intend," "estimate," "may," "will," "would," "could,"
 "should" or other similar expressions.  Additionally, all statements in this
 document, including forward-looking statements, speak only as of the date
 they are made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any
 statement in light of new information or future events.  A number of
 factors, many of which are beyond the ability of the Company to control or
 predict, could cause actual results to differ materially from those in its
 forward-looking statements.

 These factors include, among others, the following: (i) changes in demand
 for mortgage loans due to fluctuations in the real estate market, interest
 rates or the market in which the Company sells its mortgage loans; (ii) the
 Company's access to funding sources and its ability to renew, replace or add
 to its existing credit facilities on terms comparable to the current terms;
 (iii) assumptions underlying the value of the Company's retained mortgage
 loan-servicing rights;  (iv) the negative impact of economic slowdowns or
 recessions; (v) management's ability to manage the Company's growth and
 planned expansion; (vi) the effect of the competitive pressures from other
 lenders or suppliers of credit in the Company's market; (vii) changes in
 government regulations that affect the Company's business; (viii) the
 Company's ability to expand origination volume while reducing overhead;
 (ix) the impact of new state or federal legislation or court decisions
 restricting the activities of lenders or suppliers of credit in the
 Company's market; (x) other risk factors disclosed from time to time in the
 Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and (xi) the
 inability of the Company to manage the risks associated with the foregoing
 as well as anticipated. These risks and uncertainties should be considered
 in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be
 placed on such statements. Additional information concerning the Company and
 its business, including additional factors that could materially affect the
 Company's financial results, is included in the Company's filings with the
 Securities and Exchange Commission.

 EXHIBIT 99.1


 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

           United Financial Mortgage Corp. Reports First Quarter Results


 * Servicing Portfolio Reaches $1.5 Billion

 * Steve Khoshabe and Anthony Schweiger added to Board of Directors


 Oak Brook, IL, Thursday, September 9, 2004 -- United Financial Mortgage
 Corp. (Amex: UFM or the "Company") today announced results for the first
 quarter ended July 31, 2004.


 First Quarter Results

 Revenues for the quarter ended July 31, 2004 decreased $6.9 million to $15.6
 million from $22.4 million for the quarter ended July 31, 2003.  Net income
 was $.9 million, or $.15 per diluted share (based on 6,148,940 fully diluted
 shares outstanding) for the most recent quarter, as compared with $1.8
 million, or $.43 per diluted share (based on 4,123,196 fully diluted shares
 outstanding), for the corresponding period last year.


 Mortgage Banking Business

 As of July 31, 2004, the mortgage loans in the Company's mortgage loan-
 servicing portfolio had an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $1.5
 billion, up from $939 million from the same date last year.  Income from
 mortgage loan-servicing increased by $561 thousand to $783 thousand for the
 quarter ended July 31, 2004, a 253% increase from the same period last year.
 The weighted average coupon interest rate of the mortgage loans in the loan-
 servicing portfolio was approximately 5.4% as of July 31, 2004.

 The Company funded $471 million in mortgage loans during the quarter ended
 July 31, 2004, a $547 million decrease compared to the quarter ended July
 31, 2003.

 Commenting on mortgage operations in the Company's first quarter, Steve
 Khoshabe, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company stated,
 "Despite facing the continued challenges of today's mortgage environment,
 we were able to deliver solid earnings and grow our book value to $4.97
 per share."

 Mr. Khoshabe added, "We continue to implement our growth strategy of
 increasing our servicing portfolio, growing our core origination platform,
 and diversifying our business.  During the first quarter, we opened two
 new retail offices in offices in Chicago, Illinois and Wilmington, North
 Carolina and a wholesale operations center in Charlotte, North Carolina.
 In addition, we have also added six retail branch offices through our
 acquisition of Vision Mortgage Group, Inc.

 With our balanced approach of continuing to selectively build our
 mortgage loan-servicing portfolio, expanding both organically and through
 acquisitions, controlling costs, and diversifying our business, we believe
 we are well positioned for continued growth in fiscal 2005."
