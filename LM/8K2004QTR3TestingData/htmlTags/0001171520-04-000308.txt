income for the year ended July 31, 2004 increased $11.8 million, or 58.2%, to

*Total reflects rounding

All non-GAAP numbers have been adjusted to exclude special charges. A
reconciliation of specific adjustments to GAAP results for the years ended July
31, 2004 and 2003 is included in the financial tables shown above. A description
of the Company's use of non-GAAP information is provided under "Non-GAAP
Results" below.

On December 29, 2003, the Company assigned and transferred all of its
obligations of its two "ineffective" interest rate swaps to a third party at a
cost of $5.4 million plus accrued interest. As a result of this novation, these
"ineffective" swaps will no longer be included as a special item for future
fiscal periods. These "ineffective" swaps were included as a special item
through the second quarter of fiscal 2004.

The Company entered into interest rate swap agreements in October 1998, August
2001 and May 2003. The October 1998 and August 2001 agreements were
"ineffective" hedges as a result of the options held by the counter parties that
may extend the original term of the interest rate swap agreements. Applicable
accounting treatment requires that the Company record the changes in fair value
of the October 1998 and August 2001 agreements in its consolidated statement of
income, rather than within "other comprehensive income" in its statement of
stockholders' equity. The changes in fair value are dependent upon the forward
looking yield curves for each swap. The May 2003 agreement is an "effective"
hedge and therefore does not require this treatment. The Company believes that
its October 1998 and August 2001 agreements are special items that are
excludable as non-recurring items. First, the Company only intends to enter into
<PAGE>

"effective" hedges going forward. This stated intention began with the May 2003
agreement. Second, the Company believes that the October 1998 and August 2001
agreements may distort and confuse investors if the change in fair value cannot
be treated as a special item because their inclusion directly impacts its
reported earnings per share. A change in fair value, whether positive or
negative, can significantly increase or decrease its reported earnings per
share. For example, the Company recorded a positive change in fair value for the
second quarter of fiscal 2004 that increased its diluted earnings per share by
$0.01, and in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the company recorded a negative
change in fair value that decreased its diluted earnings per share by $0.03. If
the Company were prohibited from excluding this item as a special item, it would
artificially inflate its reported earnings per share and thereby mislead
investors as to its results of operations and our financial condition.

Comments from Management

"I am very pleased with our Company's performance in fiscal 2004," commented
Steven Townsend, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "These results reflect
the success of our operating and marketing strategies which enabled us to
experience solid growth in our three primary distribution channels. We were also
able to strengthen our financial position and solidify our balance sheet. At the
same time, we continued to strengthen our industry presence by entering new
channels of business and fostering several new and renewed business
relationships."

Mr. Townsend added, "As we look ahead, we are excited about our Company's
prospects for fiscal 2005 and beyond. Our efforts remain focused on helping our
customers be more successful in their marketplace while maintaining our position
as America's premier certified organic distributor. To ensure that United
Natural Foods is well positioned to capitalize on favorable growth opportunities
in the natural and organic foods industry we will continue to invest in our
people, facilities, equipment and new technologies."

The Company reaffirms its guidance for fiscal 2005, ending July 31, 2005, with
revenues in the $1.9 to $2.0 billion range, and net income, excluding potential
special items, in the range of $0.93 - $0.97 per diluted share. Special items
may include labor, moving and other costs related to the expansion of the
Company's distribution facilities. Historically, expenses related to the change
in fair value of interest rate swaps, distribution facility expansions and asset
impairment charges (including goodwill) have been classified as special items.
However, at this time the Company does not know the extent or significance of
these items or whether the Company will in fact incur any of these or other
special items in fiscal 2005. The Company's guidance is based on a number of
assumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the
control of the Company. If any of these assumptions vary, the Company's guidance
may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these
results. A description of the Company's use of non-GAAP information is provided
under "Non-GAAP Results" below.

"Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995: Statements in this press release regarding the Company's business that are
not historical facts are "forward-looking statements" that involve risks and
uncertainties. For a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, which could
cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking
statements, including but not limited to general business conditions, the impact
of competition and our dependence on principal customers, see "Risk Factors" in
the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the Commission on June
14, 2004, and its other filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. Any forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and, as such, speak only as of the date
made. The Company is not undertaking to update any information in the foregoing
reports until the effective date of its future reports required by applicable
laws. Any projections of future results of operations should not be construed in
any manner as a guarantee that such results will in fact occur. These
projections are subject to change and could differ materially from final
reported results. The Company may from time to time update these publicly
announced projections, but it is not obligated to do so.

Non-GAAP Results: To supplement its financial statements presented on a GAAP
basis, the Company uses non-GAAP additional measures of operating results, net
earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude special charges. The Company
believes that the use of these additional measures is appropriate to enhance an
overall understanding of its past financial performance and also its prospects
for the future as these special charges are not expected to be part of the
Company's ongoing business. The adjustments to the Company's GAAP results are
made with the intent of providing both management and investors with a more
complete understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and its
marketplace performance. For example, these adjusted non-GAAP results are among
the primary indicators management uses as a basis for its planning and
forecasting of future periods. The presentation of this additional information
is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings
or diluted earnings per share prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America. A comparison and
reconciliation from non-GAAP to GAAP results is included in the tables within
this release.
