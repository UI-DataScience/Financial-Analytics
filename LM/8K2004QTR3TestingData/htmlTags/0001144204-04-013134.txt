                  SBE, INC. REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2004 RESULTS

                        REVENUES JUMP 81% YEAR OVER YEAR

SAN RAMON, CA -- AUGUST 25, 2004 -- SBE, Inc. (Nasdaq:SBEI),  a leading provider
of high performance OEM network connectivity  solutions,  today reported results
for the three-month and nine-month periods ended July 31, 2004.

Net sales for the third  quarter of 2004 were $2.9  million,  compared with $1.6
million  for the third  quarter  ended July 31,  2003.  Net income for the third
quarter of 2004 was  $79,000,  or $0.02 and $0.01 per share,  basic and diluted,
compared to net income for the third  quarter of 2003 of $141,000,  or $0.03 per
share, basic and diluted.

Net sales for the nine months  ended July 31, 2004 were $8.8  million,  compared
with $5.2  million for the same period last year.  Net income was  $660,000,  or
$0.13 and $0.11 per share, basic and diluted,  respectively, for the nine months
ended July 31, 2004  compared to a net income of  $284,000,  or $0.04 per share,
basic and diluted, for the first nine months of fiscal 2003.

Gross margin for the third quarter of 2004 was 53%, compared to 66% for the same
quarter in 2003.  Gross  margin for the nine months ended July 31, 2004 was 54%,
compared to 62% reported for the same period of 2003.  The decrease in the gross
margin is due primarily to the reduction in the gross margin attributable to the
sale of products to a large  customer  combined with  approximately  $102,000 of
non-cash  quarterly  amortization  of the  intellectual  property  acquired from
Antares in the fourth  quarter of fiscal  2003.  Our gross  margin on sales to a
large  customer  for the quarter  was lower in the same  quarter in 2003 due, in
part, to sales in 2003 of  previously  written down  inventory.  The Company has
also seen some erosion in gross  margin due to slightly  higher raw material and
manufacturing  costs. To help counteract  component delivery lead-time and price
increase issues,  we have decided to purchase certain critical  components ahead
of our customer's  orders.  Although we continue to have limited visibility into
our customer's  product demand, our critical inventory purchase plan is based on
our best estimate of current customer demand and their past ordering patterns.

Total operating  expenses increased in the third quarter of 2004 to $1.5 million
compared to $1.0 million in the same  quarter of 2003,  primarily as a result of
increases in the  staffing  levels of our  engineering  group  combined  with an
increase  in  marketing  investments.  SBE  continues  to  pursue  a  policy  of
aggressive  investment in new product  research and  development  and have added
engineering resources to execute the programs. During the past year SBE returned
to product  advertising and industry trade show participation to promote our new
product  rollout and take advantage of the economic  recovery.  Total  operating
expenses for the nine months  ended July 31, 2004 were $4.1 million  compared to
$3.0 million in the same period one year ago.

"Our third  quarter  revenues  grew 81% year over year and we achieved our goals
for sales backlog for the quarter just ended. Although we have not seen a robust
recovery of the overall networking and communications markets, we do continue to
see strength from our legacy  products  along with customer  product  deployment
activity in select areas such as WiFi, E911, voice conferencing,  and VoIP media
gateways,"  said  William B. Heye,  Jr.,  president  and CEO,  SBE. "We achieved
important  milestones with our new product  initiatives during the quarter. I am
pleased  to report  that we  installed  our Dual Port  Gigabit  Ethernet  TCP/IP
Offload  Engine  ("TOE")  product in select BETA customer sites and test results
indicate  that  the TOE  performance  exceeds  expectations.  The  TOE has  been
installed  in  conjunction  with PyX  Technologies'  iSCSI  software for storage
networking   applications  as  well  as  independently  in  high-traffic  server
applications.  This BETA testing will continue as we approach  production status
in the coming quarter. We continue to make key investments in R&D and during the
quarter  released  several new products such as the addition of packet  switched
backplane  capability  to our HighWire  line, a new 24 channel T1 card set and a
672 channel T3 adapter card.  These new products are attractive to our customers
for their  application-ready  telecommunications  platforms,  and enable  timely
integration and product  deployment.  Overall, I am pleased with the progress we
have made in implementing our strategic plan," said Heye.

The company  continues to generate  adequate cash flow and liquidity to fund its
business plan. SBE closed the quarter with a sales backlog of $3.9 million, $1.5
million in cash and $5.3 million in working capital (current assets less current
liabilities).

BUSINESS OUTLOOK

The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are
forward-looking,  and actual results may differ  materially.  See the cautionary
statement at the end of this press release for a summary of the risks associated
with  forward-looking  statements and where to find more  information  regarding
such risks.

"Based on our current view of business,  sales forecasts,  and existing backlog,
we expect  revenue  growth and  profitability  will  continue  in the  remaining
quarter of fiscal 2004.  We  anticipate  net sales for fiscal 2004 to be between
$12.0 million and $14.0 million and diluted earnings per share for the year will
be between $0.12 and $0.14.  We remain  committed to our strategy of maintaining
profitability in the near term while  positioning the organization for long-term
growth with R&D investments in high growth markets," said Heye.
