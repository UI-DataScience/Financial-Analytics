LTX Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Results

    WESTWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 26, 2004--LTX Corporation
(Nasdaq: LTXX), a leading provider of semiconductor test solutions,
today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal
year ended July 31, 2004. The operating results for the quarter were
at the high end of Company guidance.
    Sales for the quarter were $80,434,000, up from $70,333,000 in the
third quarter, with net income of $8,896,000, or $0.14 per share. Net
income for the third fiscal quarter was $4,306,000, or $0.07 per
share. Sales were $33,654,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2003 and net loss was $(81,531,000), or $(1.61) per share. New orders
for the fourth quarter were $66 million, down 15% from the prior
quarter and up 64% from the fourth quarter last fiscal year. There
were no customer cancellations during the quarter.
    For the twelve-month period ended July 31, 2004, sales were
$255,801,000 compared to $119,449,000 in the preceding fiscal year.
Net income was $1,961,000, or $0.03 per share. For the prior fiscal
year, net loss was $(145,068,000), or $(2.92) per share.
    Roger W. Blethen, chairman and chief executive officer of LTX
commented, "We met our financial and operating targets for the quarter
including generating higher revenues and higher net income. While
overall orders were lower than anticipated, we saw a much broader mix
of customers contributing to the total, including five different
companies that each represented greater than 10% of orders during the
quarter."
    Mr. Blethen continued, "During the fiscal year, we achieved
several strategic objectives: we moved to volume production on two
second-generation Fusion systems, gained share in the subcontract test
market, demonstrated the operating leverage of our business model and
strengthened our balance sheet.
    As we enter fiscal year 2005, LTX believes it is entering a period
where the current growth cycle has stalled for the industry. Although
we cannot predict the magnitude and duration of this pullback, we
believe our business model allows us maximum flexibility to respond to
changing conditions, whichever direction the business cycle follows."

    First Quarter 2005 Outlook

    For the quarter ending October 31, 2004, revenue is expected to be
in the range of $54 million to $57 million, with gross margin at
approximately 38%. The loss per share is projected to be in the range
of $(0.07) to $(0.10) assuming 61.1 million average shares
outstanding. This guidance does not include any provisions for unusual
charges.
    The Company will conduct a conference call today, August 26, 2004,
at 4:30 PM EDT to discuss this release. The conference call will be
simulcast via the LTX web site (www.ltx.com). Audio replays of the
call can be heard through September 8, 2004 via telephone by dialing
