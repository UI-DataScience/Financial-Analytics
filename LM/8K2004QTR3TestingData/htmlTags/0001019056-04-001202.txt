FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

WEST NEW YORK, NJ, September 28, 2004................... JACLYN, INC. (AMEX:JLN)
today reported financial results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.

Net Sales for the year ended June 30, 2004 were $123,850,000 compared to
$108,960,000 a year earlier. The Company had net earnings of $1,458,000, or $.54
per diluted share. This compares to net earnings in the prior year of $683,000,
or $.27 per diluted share.

Mr. Allan Ginsburg, Chairman of the Board of Jaclyn, stated that "we are pleased
with the significant increase in sales and profitability in fiscal 2004." He
added, "while no one can accurately predict the nature of the economic recovery
which is underway and its impact on the consumer, our sense is one of guarded
optimism with respect to our overall business going forward". He concluded, "We
continue look for tactical acquisitions of other companies which would further
enhance stockholder value."


Note: This press release may contain forward-looking statements that are being
made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. The Company's actual performance and results may vary as a
result of a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, both foreseen and
unforeseen, including general economic and business conditions, competition in
the accessories and apparel markets, continuing favorable sales patterns,
pricing and consumer buying trends. Additional uncertainty exists for the
potential negative impact that a recurrence of Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome
("SARS") may have on our business relative to production in the Far East and
other countries in which we operate.
