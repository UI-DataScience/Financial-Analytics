                   CPI CORP. ANNOUNCES 2004 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
                   -----------------------------------------------

       ST. LOUIS, MO. - AUGUST 26, 2004 - CPI CORP. (NYSE: CPY) today
       reported a net loss for the 12-week second quarter ended
       July 24, 2004 of $9.1 million, or $1.14 per diluted share compared
       to a net loss of $826,000, or $0.10 per diluted share for the
       comparable quarter in fiscal 2003.  As is discussed more fully in
       the following paragraphs, the timing of Easter in 2004 versus 2003
       had a significant negative impact on the comparability of reported
       second quarter sales in 2004 compared to 2003.  In addition, the
       overall results of the second quarter of 2004 were also significantly
       impacted by the recording of other charges and impairments and the
       completion of the Company's previously announced plans to exit
       both its Mexican and mobile photography operations which began
       operations in 2002.  Other charges and impairments totaling $3.9
       million, $2.9 million on an after-tax basis or $0.36 per diluted
       share were recorded in the second quarter of 2004 consisting
       principally of severance accruals related to previously announced
       corporate headquarters staff reductions, asset write-downs and
       write-offs resulting from ongoing changes in strategic technology
       direction and accruals related to early contract terminations
       and settlements.  During the second quarter of 2004, the Company
       recorded a loss from discontinued operations, net of income tax
       benefits $2.6 million related to the discontinuance of its Mexican
       and mobile photography operations.  The $2.6 million recorded in the
       second quarter of 2004 related principally to exit costs, a
       substantial portion of which were non-cash charges relating to asset
       write-offs and write-downs, to effectuate the operational shut down
       of the businesses and to a much lesser extent ongoing operating
       losses during the period of operation during the second quarter
       prior to shut down.  This $2.6 million loss in 2004 compares to an
       $809,000 loss from such operations in the comparable quarter of 2003.

       Consolidated net sales for the second quarter of 2004 decreased $12.3
       million or 20.2% to $48.6 million from the $60.9 million reported in
       the second quarter of 2003.  The timing of Easter, a seasonably
       important time for portraiture sales, had a significant impact on the
       timing of recognition of sales revenues between the Company's first
       and second quarters.  Most of the Company's Easter-related sales in
       2004, an earlier Easter, were recognized as revenues, in accordance
       with the Company's revenue recognition policies, in the first fiscal
       quarter while such sales in 2003, a later Easter, were principally
       recognized in the second fiscal quarter. The comparability impact
       on the Company's first and second quarter sales related to the timing
       of Easter in 2003 and 2004 is eliminated by reference to year-to-date
       sales comparisons for the 24-week periods ended July 24, 2004 and
       July 19, 2003 which reflect a $13.5 million decrease or 11.6% to
       $103.5 million from the $117.1 million recorded in the first 24 weeks
       of 2003.

       2004 FIRST HALF RESULTS
       -----------------------

       The Company reported a net loss for the 24-week first half of 2004 of
       $17.9 million, or $2.22 per diluted share compared to a net loss of
       $3.6 million or $0.44 per diluted share reported in the comparable
       first half of fiscal 2003.  The overall results of the first half of
       2004 were significantly impacted by the recording of other charges
       and impairments totaling $13.5 million, $9.1 million on an after-tax
       basis or $1.14 per diluted share.  Other charges and impairments
       recorded in the first half of 2004 are summarized below:

                                       ========      =======    =======

       * Includes approximately $148,000 of total consent-related costs
         incurred by the Knightspoint Group, which the Company has
         reimbursed.

       The consent solicitation costs represent the costs incurred in the
       first quarter related to the then-ongoing consent solicitation contest.
       The accruals related to the accelerated vesting of executives covered
       by the Company's supplemental retirement plan ($3.3 million) and
       guaranteed bonuses provided for in employment contracts for those
       covered executives whose employment continues with the Company ($76,000
       per quarter) were both triggered by change of control provisions in
       employment contracts as a result of the change in the composition of
       the Company's Board resulting from the completion of the consent
       solicitation.  The reserves for potential severance obligations
       recorded in the first quarter were triggered by the dismissal of
       certain executives during the quarter.  The amounts recorded in the
       second quarter relate to severance accruals associated with corporate
       headquarters staff reductions that occurred during the quarter.
       During the first quarter of 2004, the Company's reconstituted Board
       along with its new management leadership in the technology function,
       made a decision to materially alter the Company's previously planned
       and recently in-process technology platform that was to serve as the
       foundation for the eventual conversion to full digital technology in
       our studios.  As a result of this decision, certain previously
       capitalized software development costs related to the development of
       the previous platform no longer have future utility to the Company
       and, accordingly, have been written off.  During the second quarter
       of 2004, additional strategic decisions were made regarding the
       Company's technology platform that necessitated the write-off or
       write-down of certain other technology-related assets.  The other
       category for the first quarter relates to the write-off of a
       non-refundable loan commitment fee paid and recorded as a prepaid
       asset prior to the change of control.  The second quarter charges
       relate to accruals resulting from early contract terminations and
       settlements with certain of the Company's vendors.

       As previously discussed, total net sales for the first half of 2004
       decreased $13.5 million or 11.6% to $103.5 million from the $117.1
       million recorded in the first half of 2003.  This sales decline was
       driven by a 9% decrease in sittings from 1,794,000 to 1,638,000 coupled
       with a 4% decline in average sales per customer sitting from $64.91 to
       $62.39.  The Company believes that the continuing decline in first half
       sittings is attributable to several external and internal factors.
       Among the external factors are the impacts of continuing competitive
       pressures, including the opening of new competitor locations and severe
       price discounting.  In addition, the rate at which customers continue
       to adopt amateur digital photography technologies has accelerated which
       may be impacting the frequency of studio visits.  Internal factors
       potentially negatively impacting sittings include the Company's
       decision, beginning in the second half of 2003, to reduce studio
       employment costs through lower allocations of hours toward coverage
       and training/retention, which allocation is currently being partially
       restored, as well as potential effects from reduced advertising spending
       in the fourth quarter of 2003 which is being addressed by implementation
       of a more targeted and focused marketing approach in the second half of
       2004.  In  addition, it is likely that some customers visiting our
       studios are receiving a less than optimal experience as a result of
       certain technology and support challenges caused by our aging studio
       infrastructure which also is currently under review as part of the new
       Board's review of options to transition the studios to full digital
       technology.

       The net decrease in average sale per customer sitting is the result of
       increased discounting in response to competitive pricing pressures and
       the elimination of sitting fees on certain offers targeted at new
       customer acquisition, partially offset by the positive impact of a
       continuing mix shift toward the higher value custom offer.

       Through the first four weeks of the third quarter, sales continue to
       run significantly below those of the comparable period of the prior year
       by being down approximately 13%, driven by a 15% decline in sittings
       being only partially offset by a 2% increase in average sale per
       customer sitting.

       There are a number of initiatives currently under way and under
       consideration for the second half of the year designed to reverse the
       negative sales trend experienced over the past several years and
       continuing in the first half of 2004.  These initiatives include, among
       others, a studio hardware upgrade, a full digital test in a meaningful
       number of studios, increased studio coverage hours, pricing/offer
       changes and more targeted marketing support.

       Losses from continuing operations for the first half of 2004 were $20.5
       million compared to $3.7 million in the first half of 2003.  Excluding
       other charges and impairments recorded in the first half of 2004
       totaling $13.5 million, losses from continuing operations would have
       increased $3.3 million to $7.0 million from the $3.7 million recorded
       in the comparable period of 2003.  This $3.3 million increase in
       operating losses from continuing operations is the result of a $13.5
       million sales shortfall which was partially offset by decreases in cost
       of sales of $1.4 million and selling, general and administrative
       expenses of $8.6 million.  The decrease in selling, general and
       administrative expenses is primarily attributable to decreases in
       employment costs of $3.2 million $2.6 million related to studio
       employment costs and $600,000 related to corporate headquarters
       employment costs), decreased commissions due Sears of $2.2 million
       and overall net decreases in various other categories of expenses
       resulting from the Company's cost reduction initiatives.  The decline
       in studio employment costs is the result not only of lower sitting
       and sales volumes but is also partially attributable to the Company's
       previously-discussed decision beginning in the second half of 2003 to
       reduce studio employment costs through lower allocation of hours toward
       coverage and training.  The decline in corporate headquarters employment
       costs is the result of previously discussed executive and staff
       reductions that took place near the end of the first quarter and during
       the second quarter of 2004.

       BUSINESS STRATEGY UPDATE
       ------------------------

       The Company's recently reconstituted Board is continuing its process of
       reviewing, assessing and taking actions with respect to the Company's
       business strategy.  To date, several executive leadership changes have
       been made and the Company has exited its Mexican and mobile photography
       operations commenced in 2002.  In addition, the Company has materially
       altered its previously planned and recently in-process technology
       platform that was to serve as the foundation for an eventual conversion
       to full digital technology in our studios.  The Company continues to
       review and evaluate its options to transition the studios to full
       digital technology as rapidly as is prudently possible, including the
       rollout in the second half of 2004 of full digital technology to a
       meaningful number of our studios.  At the same time, management and
       the Board continue to evaluate a potential return of capital.

(2) EBITDA represents net earnings (loss) from continuing operations in
    thousands of dollars before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation
    and amortization and other non-cash charges.  EBITDA is included because
    it is one liquidity measure used by certain investors to determine a
    company's ability to service its indebtedness.  EBITDA is unaffected by
    the debt and equity structure of the company.  EBITDA does not represent
    cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, is not necessarily indicative
    of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and should not be considered
    an alternative to net income under GAAP for purposes of evaluating the
    Company's results of operations.  EBITDA is not necessarily comparable with
    similarly-titled measures for other companies.
