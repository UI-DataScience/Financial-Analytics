FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:              Wednesday, September 15, 2004

  Versar Announces Solid Year End Results along with Its Fifth
                 Consecutive Profitable Quarter

Springfield,  VA,  Wednesday, September  15,  2004  VERSAR,  Inc.
(Amex:  VSR) today announced positive financial results  for  the
fiscal year ending June 30, 2004. Net income for fiscal year 2004
was  $1,191,000  or  $0.16  per  share  compared  to  a  loss  of
$1,008,000, $0.14 per share or approximately a $2.2 million or  a
$.40  per  share  improvement over last year.   Operating  income
increased in fiscal year 2004 by $1,015,000 over the prior fiscal
year  on gross revenue of $60,454,000, a 6% increase compared  to
gross  revenue for the prior fiscal year.  The improved financial
results are the result of last year's restructuring program along
with rebuilding the Company for future growth.

Versar finished the year with a funded backlog of $46 million,  a
44%  increase  over that reported at the end of the prior  fiscal
year.   In addition, total contract backlog (backlog the  Company
expects  to  book  with  existing unfunded multi-year  contracts)
increased to an all time high of $370 million.  This was  due  to
the  award of several new large, multi-year contracts as well  as
winning  all  of  its contracts that were up  for  re-compete  in
fiscal year 2004.

Versar's  balance sheet was strengthened so that as of  June  30,
2004,  the Company completely repaid its line of credit and  held
approximately $817,000 in cash.  Versar now has approximately  $6
million  of  working  capital for future  business  growth.   The
Company's  equity has now exceeded $10 million  and  the  balance
sheet ratios exceed industry averages.

Gross  revenue  for  the fourth quarter was  $17,431,000,  a  21%
increase  over the same quarter of fiscal year 2003.  Net  income
for  the  fourth quarter was $461,000 or $0.06 per share compared
to  $519,000  or  $0.07  per share for  the  fourth  quarter  the
previous  year.  The slight drop in profitability in  the  fourth
quarter  2004  was  due to unplanned costs as  a  result  of  new
regulatory  requirements in the Company's chemical and biological
laboratories.

Dr. Ted Prociv, President and CEO of Versar said "The operational
and  financial  results  for fiscal year  2004  create  a  strong
foundation  for future success.  The results of our restructuring
and  focus on the federal marketplace have led to a new, directed
organization  which  will  allow us  to  take  advantage  of  the
tremendous  business  opportunities  in  the  infrastructure  and
national  security  marketplaces.  Five  profitable  quarters,  a
growing  backlog  and  strengthened balance  sheet,  now  enables
Versar to focus on growth; both on the top and bottom line."
