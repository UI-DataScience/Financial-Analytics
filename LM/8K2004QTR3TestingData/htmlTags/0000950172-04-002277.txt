                HARTMARX REPORTS IMPROVED THIRD QUARTER REVENUES
                         AND 41% NET EARNINGS INCREASE;
             COMPANY AGAIN RAISES FULL YEAR 2004 EARNINGS GUIDANCE


CHICAGO, September 29, 2004 - - Hartmarx Corporation (NYSE: HMX) today reported
improved operating results for its third quarter and nine months ended August
31, 2004. Third quarter revenues were $155.8 million in 2004 compared to $151.6
million in 2003. Net earnings improved to $5.0 million or $.14 per diluted
share in the current period compared to net earnings of $3.5 million or $.10
per diluted share in the third quarter of 2003. For the nine months, revenues
increased 5.9% to $434.8 million from $410.4 million in 2003. Net earnings
improved to $10.1 million or $.28 per diluted share compared to net earnings of
$5.6 million or $.16 per diluted share in 2003.

         Homi B. Patel, chairman and chief executive officer of Hartmarx,
commented, "We are executing well, achieving sales and earnings increases,
improved operating margins and significant debt reduction from efficient
working capital management. For the full year, we continue to expect a sales
increase in the mid single digits. As a result of anticipating a favorable
impact of $.02 to $.03 per diluted share to fourth quarter earnings from the
Misook acquisition, we are once again increasing our estimate for full year
earnings from a 50% increase over last year to a 55% - 60% increase. Total debt
of $132.5 million at August 31 declined $23.6 million or 15.1% from the year
earlier level, even after reflecting the $32.1 million cash payment related to
the Misook acquisition," Mr. Patel concluded.

         Third quarter operating earnings were $9.8 million in 2004 compared to
$7.9 million in 2003. The Misook business contributed $.01 to third quarter
earnings per diluted share. For the nine months, operating earnings improved to
$21.3 million from $15.9 million in 2003. The increase reflected the sales
improvement, including approximately $4 million from the Misook business, along
with a higher year-to-date gross margin rate of 30.6% compared to 29.5% in
2003. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $6.5 million on
the higher sales, including the Misook business, representing 26.1% of sales
compared to 26.0% in 2003.

         Interest expense for the nine months declined to $4.6 million from
$5.5 million in 2003, principally from lower average borrowing levels.
Year-to-date results for 2003 also included a $.8 million first quarter pre-tax
refinancing charge associated with the January, 2003 early retirement of the
then outstanding 12.5% senior unsecured notes, representing the non-cash
write-off of unamortized debt discount and financing fees.
