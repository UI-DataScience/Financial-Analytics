      Visual Data Reports Fiscal 2004 Third Quarter Results Pompano Beach, FL -
August 17, 2004 - Visual Data Corporation (Nasdaq: VDAT), a business services
provider that specializes in webcasting, digital asset management and audio and
video transport and collaboration services, today announced its financial
results for the third quarter ended June 30, 2004.

Third Quarter Financial Results Highlights:

      o     Revenue: Revenue increased 13% to approximately $2.1 million for the
            third quarter ended June 30, 2004, from approximately $1.9 million
            for the third quarter ended June 30, 2003.

      o     EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
            amortization) (EBITDA Loss): The EBITDA loss increased to
            approximately $687,000 for the third quarter ended June 30, 2004,
            compared to EBITDA of approximately $53,000 for the comparable
            quarter in the prior year. Included in the EBITDA loss for the
            quarter ended June 30, 2004 is approximately $448,000 of non-cash
            expenses and charges.

      o     Net Loss: Net loss was approximately $1,207,000, or $.26 per share,
            for the third quarter ended June 30, 2004, an increase of 62%
            compared to approximately $743,000, or $.30 per share for the
            comparable quarter in the prior year.

      o     Gross Margin: Gross margin decreased slightly to 64% for the third
            quarter ended June 30, 2004, down from 65% for the comparable
            quarter in the prior year.

Third Quarter Ended June 30, 2004 Financial Results Summary

For the third quarter ended June 30, 2004, revenue increased 13% to $2,141,405
from $1,896,740 for the third quarter ended June 30, 2003. The Company incurred
a net loss of $1,207,252, or $.26 per share, for the third quarter ended June
30, 2004, compared to a net loss of $742,554, or $.30 per share during the third
quarter ended June 30, 2003.

The Company incurred an EBITDA loss during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 of
approximately $687,000, compared to EBITDA of approximately $53,000 during the
comparable quarter in the prior year. The increased EBITDA loss during the
recently ended third quarter was primarily attributed to an increase in
professional fees and other expense. Professional fees include non-cash expenses
resulting from the issuance of shares of stock, options and warrants of
approximately $227,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, compared to
approximately $95,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2003. Other expense,
excluding interest expense or income increased approximately $518,000. Included
in Other Income and Expense are non-cash costs including settlements of
obligations, allocation of losses from Onstream Media, inventory reserves and
write-offs and gains or losses on the disposal of fixed assets. The total
non-cash costs included in other expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 was
approximately $222,000.

                                     99.1-1

<PAGE>

"The increase in revenue during the recently ended third quarter as compared to
the third quarter of fiscal 2003 and the preceding first two quarters of fiscal
2004 was due to sales of the Company's new digital asset management services,"
said Randy Selman, president and Chief Executive Officer of Visual Data. "This
new service, which was deployed during the second quarter of fiscal 2004
following the Company's purchase of processing and distribution software and
other assets from Virage, Inc., contributed approximately $417,000 to our total
revenues for the quarter ending June 30, 2004. This increase was partially
offset by reduced revenues from our Webcasting Group as a result of a decrease
in total events, most notably in the lower-priced, audio-only segment. We have
been able to significantly offset this erosion in event production by focusing
on building sales in the higher per-event priced product segment that
capitalizes on our proprietary feature set, including slides, chat, polling and
streaming video solutions, as opposed to the lower-priced audio-only segment.
Looking ahead, we expect the growth of our higher end service offering, coupled
with future growth in our digital asset management services, will enable us to
grow our revenue base in coming quarters."
