   FONAR IMPROVES WORKING CAPITAL SURPLUS BY 67% AND
             REVENUES BY 35% IN FISCAL 2004

    First Three Managed Stand-Up(TM) MRI Centers Net
            $1.6 Million in Operating Income

Melville,   New  York,   September   16,  2004  -  FONAR
Corporation   (NASDAQ-FONR),   The  MRI  Specialist(TM),
reported today a net loss of $9.5 million on revenues of
$71.6 million for fiscal 2004, as compared to a net loss
of $15.0 million on revenues of $52.9 million for fiscal
2003. This represents an increase of 35% in revenues and
a decrease  in the net loss of 37% from  fiscal  2003 to
fiscal 2004.

Most   significantly,   revenues   attributable  to  the
Company's  medical equipment segment increased by 62% to
$48.6  million  in fiscal  2004 from  $30.0  million  in
fiscal  2003.  Revenues  from  product  sales  more than
doubled,  increasing by 72% from $24.9 million in fiscal
2003  to  $43.0   million  in  fiscal  2004.   This  was
attributable  to the increase in scanner sales  revenues
for the Company's Stand-Up(TM) MRI from $24.9 million to
$43.0 million.  The Company's backlog of unfilled orders
at July 1,  2004 was  approximately  $40.7  million,  as
compared to $26.8 million at July 1, 2003.

For    more    information    and   a   chart   go   to:
www.FONAR.com/news/091604.htm

Confirming  the  Company's   expectations  of  increased
demand  for its  scanners,  product  sales to  unrelated
parties more than  doubled,  by 113% in fiscal 2004 from
$17.7  million in fiscal 2003 to $37.7 million in fiscal
2004.  Product sales to related parties decreased 27% in
fiscal  2004 from $7.3  million  in fiscal  2003 to $5.3
million  in  fiscal  2004.Revenues  attributable  to the
Company's  physician and diagnostic  services management
segment  (HMCA),  reversed  their  decline,   increasing
slightly  by 0.2% to $23.0  million in fiscal  2004 from
$22.9  million in fiscal 2003,  reflecting  increases in
MRI scan volume at certain MRI facilities  equipped with
Stand-Up(TM) MRI's. HMCA now manages four MRI facilities
with Stand-Up(TM) MRI scanners. The first three, located
in Islandia,  Staten Island and  Bensonhurst,  New York,
produced $1.6 million in operating income for HMCA. HMCA
recently  installed  a  Stand-Up(TM)  MRI in Boca Raton,
Florida  to  replace  the   existing   MRI  facility  in
Deerfield Beach, Florida.

The Company's consolidated operating loss decreased,  by
44% to $8.5  million  for fiscal  2004 as compared to an
operating  loss of $15.1  million for fiscal  2003.  The
Company's   cash,   cash   equivalents   and  marketable
securities increased by 36% to $20.6 million at June 30,
2004 from $15.2 at June 30,  2003.  All  current  assets
increased  by 54% from $35.7  million in fiscal  2003 to
$55.1 million in fiscal 2004 while  current  liabilities
increased by 46%,  from $22.2  million in fiscal 2003 to
$32.5   million  in  fiscal  2004.   Consequently,   the
Company's  working capital surplus,  which is a positive
difference    between   current   assets   and   current
liabilities,  increased  by 67% from  $13.5  million  in
fiscal 2003 to $22.6 million.

High gross profit margins on product sales  continued to
increase: 38% for fiscal 2004 compared to 36% for fiscal
2003. We attribute these trends to the continuing growth
of our MRI product sales,  particularly our Stand-Up(TM)
MRI scanners and the  increased  efficiencies  resulting
from our higher sales volumes.

Orders for 39  Stand-Up(TM)  MRI scanners  were received
during   fiscal  2004  as  compared  to  orders  for  22
Stand-Up(TM)    MRI   scanners   during   fiscal   2003,
representing an increase in orders of 77%.

Raymond  Damadian,  president and chairman said,  "We're
pleased at the results of our efforts to upgrade the MRI
facilities.  The first three of HMCA's  Stand-Up(TM) MRI
upgrades are working well,  contributing $1.6 million in
operating  income to HMCA for fiscal 2004.  In addition,
we have recently  completed the installation of a fourth
Stand-Up(TM) MRI, in Boca Raton Florida. We are planning
to open two new sites  with  Stand-Up(TM)  MRI  scanners
within the next 12 months,  which  would bring the total
number of facilities with  Stand-Up(TM)  MRI scanners we
manage to six."
