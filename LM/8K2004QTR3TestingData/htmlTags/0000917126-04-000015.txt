QUALITY DINING REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS

MISHAWAKA,  Ind.  (September 15, 2004)  -  Quality  Dining,  Inc.
(NASDAQ/NM:QDIN) today announced total revenues of $56.9  million
for  the third quarter of fiscal 2004 versus $52.0 million during
the same period in fiscal 2003.  For the 40 weeks ended August 1,
2004,  the  Company  reported total revenues  of  $173.2  million
versus  $166.9  million in the comparable  period  during  fiscal
2003.

The  Company  reported  net income of $1,236,000,  or  $0.12  per
diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to a
net  loss  of $133,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the  same
period  in  fiscal 2003.  For the first 40 weeks of fiscal  2004,
the  Company  reported  net income of $1,769,000,  or  $0.17  per
diluted  share, compared to a net loss of $233,000, or $0.02  per
diluted share, for the comparable period in fiscal 2003.

The  Company also reported that it has concluded that there was  an
error   in  the  calculation  of  the  weighted  average   shares
outstanding in the Company's financial statements for the sixteen
weeks ended February 15, 2004 included in the Company's Form 10-Q
for  the  quarterly  period  ended February  15,  2004,  and  the
Company's  financial statements for the twelve  and  twenty-eight
weeks  ended May 9, 2004 included in the Company's Form 10-Q  for
the  quarterly  period  ended May 9,  2004.   The  error  in  the
calculation of weighted average shares outstanding had no  impact
on  the  Company's  previously  reported  financial  position  or
results  of  operations including net income but did  affect  the
calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share  for
each reporting period.

Specifically, the shares of the Company's common stock
held by an affiliated real estate entity should have been
excluded from the calculation of weighted average shares
outstanding in the Company's financial statements for the sixteen
weeks ended February 15, 2004 and the twelve and the twenty-eight
weeks ended May 9, 2004.   The affiliated real estate entity
leases certain Burger King restaurants to the Company and is
owned by the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Beginning October 27, 2003, the Company has consolidated the
affiliated real estate entity pursuant to the guidance in FASB
Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities", as amended (FIN 46R).  The Company appropriately
reflected the common stock held by the affiliated real estate
entity as treasury stock on its consolidated balance sheets at
February 15, 2004 and May 9, 2004.

Accordingly,  the  Company will adjust  the  previously  reported
weighted  average  shares outstanding and  resultant  net  income
(loss) per share data in its financial statements for the sixteen
weeks  ended  February 15, 2004 and the twelve  and  twenty-eight
weeks  ended May 9, 2004, to reflect the proper weighted  average
shares  outstanding and the proper basic and diluted  net  income
(loss)  per  share.   This  adjustment will  have  the  following
effect:
