            JoS. A. Bank Clothiers' Earnings Increase 75%

    HAMPSTEAD, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 9, 2004--JoS. A. Bank
Clothiers, Inc. (Nasdaq National Market: "JOSB") announced net income
of $3.5 million for the second quarter ended July 31, 2004, compared
with net income of $2.0 million in the second quarter of FY2003 -
representing an increase of 75% and another record quarter for the
Company when compared with the prior-year period. Earnings per share
increased to $0.25 in the most recent quarter, compared with $0.14 in
the three months ended August 2, 2003. For the first half of FY2004,
net income increased 112% to $8.9 million, versus $4.2 million, while
earnings per share reached $0.62, compared with $0.30 in the
corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.
    "Strong second quarter operating results were driven by
double-digit comp-store sales gains, continued strength in catalog and
Internet sales, new product innovations, the growing popularity of our
luxurious Signature and Signature Gold product lines, and a dynamic
new store opening program," stated Robert N. Wildrick, Chief Executive
Officer of JoS. A. Bank Clothiers, Inc.
    "We opened 20 new stores during the six months ended July 31,
2004," continued Wildrick. "Our plans call for the opening of
approximately 40 additional stores during the second half of the
fiscal year, including at least four more stores each in California,
Texas and Florida and our first stores in Seattle, Washington. Also,
the Company's new brand-building media campaign, which will play a key
role in positioning JoS. A. Bank as the premiere upscale menswear
brand in the U.S., will be launched in November 2004 with a series of
television and selective magazine advertisements."
    As previously reported, total sales for the second quarter ended
July 31, 2004 increased 27.3% to $82.0 million, compared with $64.4
million in the second quarter of 2003. Comparable store sales
increased 10.2% in the second quarter of 2004, while combined catalog
and Internet sales rose 17.9%. Total sales for the six months ended
July 31, 2004 increased 27.8% to $161.9 million, compared with $126.7
million in the first half of the previous fiscal year. Comparable
store sales increased 11.9% in the six months ended July 31, 2004,
while combined catalog and Internet sales rose 18.3%.
    All earnings per share amounts discussed herein refer to diluted
earnings per share and reflect the impact of a 50% stock dividend that
was distributed to stockholders on February 18, 2004 and a 25% stock
dividend that was distributed to stockholders on August 18, 2004.
