                     BEAR STEARNS REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2004
                           EARNINGS OF $2.09 PER SHARE

    The First Nine Months of 2004 Produce Record Earnings Per Share of $7.16

           Third Quarter Institutional Equities Net Revenues Up 19.4%
                     Wealth Management Net Revenues Up 10.7%
                          Clearing Net Revenues Up 6.7%
                      and Fixed Income Net Revenues Up 4.4%


            NEW YORK, New York - September 22, 2004 - The Bear Stearns Companies
Inc. (NYSE:BSC) today reported earnings per share (diluted) of $2.09 for the
third quarter ended August 31, 2004. For the quarter ended August 31, 2003,
earnings per share (diluted) were $2.30 which included $.38 per share (diluted)
related to Merchant Banking investment gains. Net income for the third quarter
of 2004 was $283.3 million, compared with $313.4 million for the third quarter
of 2003. Net revenues were $1.53 billion for the third quarter, up 3.3% from
$1.49 billion for the third quarter of 2003. Annualized after-tax return on
average common stockholders' equity for the current quarter was 15.9%, and for
the trailing 12-month period ended August 31, 2004 was 19.0%.

            James E. Cayne, chairman and chief executive officer of Bear
Stearns, commented, "This quarter's results demonstrate the resiliency of our
franchise in a difficult market environment. In Fixed Income, the breadth of our
business provided us with solid results. In Institutional Equities and Global
Clearing Services, the expansion of our platform has proven its value to our
clients as we continue to gain market share in the face of lower trading volume
and market volatility. Our Wealth Management businesses, both Bear Stearns Asset
Management and Private Client Services, are making strides in pursuing their
strategic growth plans."

Details of the firm's three major business segments with comparative
information follow:



CAPITAL MARKETS

      Net revenues for the Capital Markets segment were $1.20 billion for the
quarter ended August 31, 2004, down 1.7% from $1.22 billion for the third
quarter of 2003.

o     Institutional Equities net revenues were $239.3 million for the third
      quarter of 2004, a 19.4% increase from $200.5 million for the comparable
      prior year quarter. Net revenues in listed and over-the-counter securities
      declined on lower average daily trading volume and volatility, but were
      partially offset by market share gains. As a result of the consolidation
      in the first quarter of 2004 of Bear Wagner Specialists, LLC, a
      majority-owned NYSE specialist firm, revenues included in Bear Stearns'
      results from this subsidiary increased by approximately $30 million over
      the comparable 2003 period.

o     Fixed Income net revenues were $751.8 million, up 4.4% from $720.1 million
      reported for the quarter ended August 31, 2003. Mortgage revenues were
      essentially unchanged from the strong level of the third quarter of 2003,
      although the composition of net revenues changed significantly. Increases
      in adjustable-rate mortgage, commercial mortgage and asset-backed security
      originations largely offset declines in fixed-rate mortgage origination
      volume. The credit business posted strong year-over-year gains led by the
      distressed debt and leveraged finance areas.

o     Investment Banking net revenues were $208.9 million for the quarter ended
      August 31, 2004, down 30.3% from $299.7 million for the quarter ended
      August 31, 2003. Included in the third quarter of 2003 were Merchant
      Banking revenues of $92.0 million. Excluding these 2003 gains, Investment
      Banking revenues for the third quarter of 2004 were slightly higher than
      the prior year quarter. Mergers and acquisitions net revenues increased
      due to higher completed M&A volume.

GLOBAL CLEARING SERVICES

      Net revenues for Global Clearing Services were $214.4 million for
the quarter ended August 31, 2004, up 6.7% from $200.9 million for the quarter
ended August 31, 2003. Net interest revenues increased on higher customer margin
debt, free credit, stock borrow and customer short balances. Average customer
margin debt balances were $46.6 billion during the quarter ended August 31,
2004, up from $43.3 billion in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2003. Customer
short balances averaged $75.6 billion for the third quarter of 2004, as compared
with $68.0 billion for the third quarter of 2003. Commission revenues declined,
reflecting lower trading volumes among prime brokerage and fully disclosed
clients.


WEALTH MANAGEMENT

      Wealth Management net revenues for the quarter ended August 31, 2004 were
$139.8 million, an increase of 10.7% from $126.4 million for the quarter ended
August 31, 2003.

o     Private Client Services revenues were $103.5 million in the third
      quarter of 2004, an increase of 5.2% from $98.4 million in the prior year
      quarter.  The increase was primarily due to an increase in customer fees
      and net interest revenues.

o     Asset Management net revenues were up 30.0% to $36.3 million for the third
      quarter of 2004, from $27.9 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting
      significantly higher performance fees on proprietary hedge fund products.

o     Total assets under management stood at $28.1 billion on August 31, 2004,
      up 9.3% from $25.7 billion on August 31, 2003.

EXPENSES

      Non-interest expenses increased 8.8% to $1.1 billion during the August
2004 quarter from $1.0 billion in the August 2003 quarter. Compensation as a
percentage of net revenues was 48.4% for the third quarter of 2004 as compared
with 45.9% in the quarter ended August 31, 2003. Non-compensation expenses were
$347.8 million for the quarter ended August 31, 2004, up 8.3% from $321.1
million for the comparable prior year period. The third quarter 2004 pre-tax
profit margin was 28.9%. The pre-tax margin for the third quarter of 2003 was
32.5%, heavily influenced by significant gains from the Merchant Banking
investment in Aeropostale.

        As of August 31, 2004, total capital, including stockholders' equity and
long-term borrowings, was $41.6 billion. Book value as of August 31, 2004 was
$55.13 per share, based on 144,052,137 shares outstanding.
