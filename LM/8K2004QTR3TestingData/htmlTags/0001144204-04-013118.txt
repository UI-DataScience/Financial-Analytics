ITEM 1.01       ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

      On August 20, 2004, the Registrant entered into an agreement with North
American Clearing, Inc. to sell all of its clearing rights for the correspondent
accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiary National Clearing Corp. ("NCC"). Under
the terms of the agreement, the Registrant will receive an initial payment of up
to $100,000, and will receive 50% of the revenue related to the transferred
correspondent accounts over the next five years, up to a maximum total payment
of $2.5 million. It is expected that the transaction will close in the third
quarter of 2004.

      Once the sale of the correspondent accounts of NCC and the pending sale of
the on-line brokerage accounts of the Registrant's other wholly-owned subsidiary
JB Oxford & Company ("JBOC") are consummated, the Registrant's primary source of
income will be earnings on the proceeds from those two transactions. The
Registrant has not yet made any determination about future business plans once
the transactions are completed, and management anticipates that it will take at
least one year from the closings to wind up the brokerage operations of the two
subsidiaries and the liabilities associated with each of them. During the next
12 to 18 months, the Registrant will evaluate available business opportunities,
and has no current plan to liquidate the Company. Management anticipates that
the proceeds from these transactions, together with earnings on such proceeds,
will provide the Registrant with sufficient liquidity to maintain its offices
and a minimal staff until such time as a new business venture is decided upon.

ITEM 2.03       CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION.

         On August 20, 2004, NCC settled two pending arbitrations involving
claims of approximately 60 former customers of correspondent firms that
previously cleared through NCC. The settlement contemplates a lump sum payment
by the Registrant of $1.25 million on or before October 18, 2004. While the
Company has not specifically recorded an accrual for this settlement, it does
maintain a general litigation reserve of which a portion may be used to offset
the charge for this settlement. The Company will evaluate the adequacy of its
general litigation reserve at the end of the third quarter. As a result of this
settlement, the Company expects to record a charge of $750,000.

ITEM 2.02       RESULTS OF OPERATION AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

      On August 16, 2004, the Registrant issued the press release attached
hereto as Exhibit 99.1 announcing financial results for the second quarter of
2004.



SIGNATURE

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the
undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 16, 2004

               JB OXFORD REPORTS SECOND QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS

LOS ANGELES - August 16, 2004 - JB Oxford Holdings,  Inc. (Nasdaq:  JBOH), which
through  its JB Oxford & Company  subsidiary  is a leading  provider of discount
brokerage services to clients nationwide,  and National Clearing Corp subsidiary
provider of  correspondent  clearing  services,  reports  results for the second
quarter ended June 30, 2004.

      On June 4, 2004,  the  Company  signed an asset  purchase  agreement  with
Ameritrade,  Inc., a subsidiary of Ameritrade Holding  Corporation,  to sell the
online  retail  accounts of JB Oxford & Company  ("JBOC"),  a  subsidiary  of JB
Oxford  Holdings,  Inc.  for up to $26  million  in  cash,  subject  to  certain
adjustments and an escrow. In addition,  the Company is actively seeking a buyer
for its correspondent clearing operation. The sale of both these asset groups is
expected to take place prior to the end of the year.  These asset groups are the
brokerage  operations  (both  clearing  and retail  brokerage  segments)  of the
Company and provide  substantially  all of its operating  revenues.  These asset
groups  have also met the  criteria  defined by SFAS No. 144 to be  reported  as
discontinued operations.

      The brokerage assets and related  liabilities  have been  reclassified and
reported as assets and  liabilities  held for sale.  No  impairment of value has
been recognized,  as management  currently believes the carrying value, less any
costs to sell,  of these assets will be fully  recoverable  from the proceeds of
the sale.  Additionally,  the Company has no plan of  liquidation  nor is it the
current intention of management to liquidate the Company.  The Company will have
cash to address its various  legal and ongoing  business  matters  following the
sale.

FINANCIAL RESULTS

      Brokerage  Revenues  totaled  $8.1  million  in this  year's  first  half,
compared  with $9.9 million a year ago.  Commission  revenue was $4.0 million in
the first half  versus  $4.1  million in the  year-ago  first  half.  First half
interest  revenue was $2.6 million,  compared with $2.8 million in 2003,  due to
lower customer margin  balances.  Trading revenue was $211,000 in the first half
2004 versus $1.3 million a year ago.  Revenue from  clearing and  execution  was
$1.2 million in the first half 2004 versus $1.4 in the year-ago period.

      Brokerage expenses were $10.7 million in the first half 2004, versus $12.4
million a year ago. First half losses from  discontinued  operations  (excluding
taxes)  totaled  $2.6 million or ($1.42) per share in 2004 versus a loss of $2.0
million  or ($1.30)  per share in 2003.  The first  half net loss  totaled  $4.0
million  or  ($2.18)  per  share in 2004  versus a net loss of $2.5  million  or
($1.64) per share in 2003.  Common stock  equivalents  have been  excluded  from
fully diluted  earnings per share  computations,  as inclusion would reduce loss
per share or be antidilutive.
