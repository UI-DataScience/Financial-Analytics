                      GFSB BANCORP, INC. ANNOUNCES EARNINGS

Gallup, New Mexico - GFSB Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ SmallCap:  GUPB), parent holding
company of Gallup Federal  Savings Bank,  Gallup,  New Mexico,  today  announced
earnings  for the year ended June 30,  2004,  of  $1,350,000  ($1.14 per diluted
share).  Earnings for the same period a year earlier were $1,690,000  ($1.46 per
diluted  share).  For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004,  earnings were $198,000
($0.17 per diluted share) compared to $473,000 ($0.41 per diluted share) for the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.

The decrease in earnings for the full year is primarily the result of a $260,000
increase in  non-interest  expense and a $517,000  increase in the provision for
loan  losses,  partially  offset by an  increase  in net  interest  earnings  of
$65,000,  an  increase  in  non-interest  earnings  of  $244,000  and a $128,000
decrease in income tax expense.  The fourth quarter earnings decline reflected a
$263,000  increase in the provision and $109,000 decrease in net interest income
which offset a $73,000 increase in non-interest income and a $30,000 decrease in
non-interest expense.

The increase in  non-interest  income for the full year was  primarily  due to a
$263,000   increase  in  service  charge  income  and  a  $44,000   increase  in
miscellaneous  income,  partially offset by a $62,000 decrease in net gains from
sales of loans.  The  increase  in service  charge  income is  primarily  due to
increased  insufficient  funds  charges  collected on NOW and checking  accounts
because of  increased  volume of  insufficient  funds  checks.  The  increase in
miscellaneous  income is primarily due to gains on the sale of other real estate
owned.  The  decrease  in income tax expense is  primarily  due to a decrease in
earnings before income taxes.  For the quarter,  non-interest  income  increased
$73,000,  primarily  due to a $55,000  increase in service  charge  income and a
$13,000 increase in net gains from sales of loans.

The increase in non-interest  expense was primarily  attributable to bank growth
and an $82,000 increase in professional  fees, which is primarily due to $52,000
in fees paid to  consultants  for  services  related to the  Company's  recently
announced  plans to merge with First Federal Banc of the Southwest,  Inc., and a
$30,000 increase in legal fees, audit expense and accounting fees largely due to
the Company's efforts to comply with requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. For
the quarter,  non-interest expense decreased $30,000, primarily due to a $34,000
decrease in advertising  and a $5,000 decrease in occupancy  expense,  partially
offset by a $10,000 increase in data processing.

<PAGE>

The  increase  in the  provision  for loan  losses  for the full year and fourth
quarter was primarily the result of an increase in classified loans, an increase
in charge-offs and growth in commercial and commercial real estate loans.

At June 30, 2004, the Company's capital to asset ratio was 7.8%, with assets and
stockholders' equity of $232.1 million and $18.1 million, respectively.
