FISCAL YEAR SUMMARY AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK
"We are pleased to conclude our fiscal year with a quarter that proved to be at
the high end of our expectations, making this both a record quarter and fiscal
year. We grew revenues 32 percent, increased core earnings 46 percent and
improved core earnings per share 44 percent over fiscal 2004. Looking ahead, we
plan to grow our business with the steady trend to outsourcing and believe 2005
will be another strong year for Jabil," said Timothy L. Main, President and
Chief Executive Officer.

Jabil provided guidance for its full fiscal year 2005 indicating that it
currently foresees revenue in a range of $7.2 to $7.4 billion, core earnings
growth of 18 to 22 percent and core earnings per share in a range of $1.20 to
$1.24 per diluted share, depending upon levels of production. GAAP earnings per
share are currently estimated to be $1.05 to $1.09 per diluted share. (Expected
GAAP earnings per share for the full fiscal year are currently estimated to
include $0.15 per share for amortization of intangibles and acquisition related
charges.)

Jabil management also reiterated guidance for its first fiscal quarter of 2005,
indicating they currently expect revenue to range from $1.75 to $1.85 billion
and core earnings per share to be in a range of $0.30 to $0.32 per diluted
share, depending upon levels of production. GAAP earnings per share are
currently estimated to be $0.26 to $0.28 per diluted share. (Expected GAAP
earnings per share for the quarter are currently estimated to include $0.04 per

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures
calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP
financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to
facilitate evaluation of Jabil's core operating performance. The non-GAAP
financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are
included in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP, or core
financial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and
may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

Due to its acquisitions and restructuring programs, Jabil has incurred
significant incremental charges that are included in the GAAP financial measures
disclosed in this release. Management believes that the incremental nature of
these amounts does not impact the performance of its core manufacturing
operations. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the
effects of the amortization of intangibles, acquisition related charges,
restructuring and impairment charges and other income) are a useful measure that
facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil's ongoing
operations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core earnings and core operating
income to provide its investors with an alternative method for assessing its
earnings and operating income from what it believes to be its core manufacturing
operations. Included in this release is a GAAP Consolidated Statement of Income,
a non-GAAP Consolidated Statement of Income, as well as a reconciliation of the
disclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial
measures.
