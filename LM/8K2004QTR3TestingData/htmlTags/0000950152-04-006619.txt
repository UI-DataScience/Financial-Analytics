COLUMBUS, OHIO, SEPTEMBER 2, 2004 - MAX & ERMA'S RESTAURANTS, INC. (Nasdaq/NMS:
MAXE) today reported third quarter 2004 financial results.

Revenues for the third quarter of 2004 rose 6% to a third quarter record $42.1
million from $39.6 million for the third quarter of 2003. Net income and net
income per diluted share fell from $620,000 or $0.24 per diluted share for the
third quarter of 2003 to a net loss of $70,000 or $(0.03) per diluted share for
the third quarter of 2004.

Year-to-date revenues increased 8% to $137.4 million for 2004 from $127.6
million for 2003. Year-to-date net income and net income per share declined 39%
and 38%, respectively to $1,318,000 or $0.51 per diluted share for 2004 from
$2,178,000 or $0.82 per diluted share for 2003.

Todd Barnum, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Max & Erma's, said this
year's revenue growth is due to the opening of six restaurants during 2003, two
restaurants opened thus far in 2004 and the opening of five franchised
restaurants during the last 12 months, which have contributed to a 35% growth in
franchise fees and royalties year-to-date. Mr. Barnum went on to say that
same-store sales were flat year-to-date, but off 1.25% during the third quarter
of 2004. Mr. Barnum attributed the sluggish sales to concerns over the economy,
higher gas prices and unusual competitive situations affecting several of the
company's restaurants.

Mr. Barnum said that in addition to soft sales, record high commodity prices put
pressure on margins during the quarter. He noted that higher ground beef,
chicken and cheese prices increased food cost by over three and a half
percentage points or $1.25 million for the quarter. He went on to say that we
are attacking this problem in several different ways. Specs and portions are
being reviewed along with all purchasing procedures and contracts. He said that
at the end of the quarter the company contracted for chicken at a $1.5 million
annual savings.

Mr. Barnum said that the reduced profitability will lead to a slower growth rate
until margins improve. Three restaurants will open in the fourth quarter of 2004
and a total of three are planned for 2005. He added that the company also
expects franchisees will open five restaurants in 2005.

As of August 1, 2004 Max & Erma's owns and operates 75 casual dining
full-service restaurants in Akron, Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Dayton,
Niles and Toledo, Ohio; Indianapolis, Indiana; Detroit, Ann Arbor, Grand Rapids
and Lansing, Michigan; Pittsburgh and Erie, Pennsylvania; Lexington and
Louisville, Kentucky; Chicago, Illinois; Charlotte, North Carolina; Atlanta,
Georgia, Virginia Beach and Norfolk, Virginia. The Company also currently
franchises twenty restaurants in Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, Wilmington,
Chillicothe, Dayton, Sandusky and Wilmington, Ohio and on the Ohio Turnpike; St.
Louis, Missouri; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and
Edinburgh, Evansville and Seymour, Indiana. The Company's common shares are
traded on the NASDAQ National Market System under the symbol MAXE.
