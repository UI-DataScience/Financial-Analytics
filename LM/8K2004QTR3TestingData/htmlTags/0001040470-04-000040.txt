                   AEHR TEST SYSTEMS REPORTS FIRST QUARTER
                           RESULTS FOR FISCAL 2005

Fremont, CA (September 21, 2004) -- Aehr Test Systems (Nasdaq: AEHR), a leading
supplier of semiconductor test and burn-in equipment, today announced financial
results for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 ended August 31, 2004.

Net sales increased 42 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 to $5.9
million, compared with $4.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.  The
Company posted a net loss of $1.3 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the
first quarter of fiscal 2005, compared with a net loss of $808,000, or $0.11
per diluted share, in the same period of the prior year.

"We are pleased with our increased sales performance," said Rhea Posedel,
chairman and chief executive officer of Aehr Test Systems.  "We had a
productive quarter, which included follow-on orders for, and the successful
shipment and installation of, MTX Fp+ systems in Asia.  The Company's gross
margins were lower than normal during the quarter, primarily because of the
substantial amount of pass-through products included in the multi-million
dollar MTX Fp+ turnkey orders announced previously.  We expect gross margins to
improve in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, as most of the pass-through
products associated with these orders were shipped by the end of the first
quarter of fiscal 2005.

"The interest level for our FOX(TM) full wafer contact products has picked up,
as the demand for stacked packages is driving the need for burned-in and tested
bare die," continued Mr. Posedel.  "We believe Aehr Test will benefit from this
over the long-term as we penetrate new market opportunities with our innovative
FOX family of wafer level test and burn-in products."

At August 31, 2004, cash, short-term investments and long-term investments were
$10.9 million, compared to $11.8 million at the end of fiscal 2004.  Aehr Test
closed the first quarter of fiscal 2005 with no outstanding debt and
shareholders' equity of $20.9 million, or $2.82 per diluted share.

"While we believe that fiscal second quarter net sales will show improvement
over the same period in the prior year, we are anticipating a net sales decline
when compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2005, primarily because of the
reduction in pass-through product shipments," said Gary Larson, vice president
and chief financial officer of Aehr Test Systems.  "We do, however, anticipate
sequential improvements in gross margins and on the bottom line."

MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE CALL
Management of Aehr Test will host a conference call and webcast today, Tuesday,
September 21, 2004 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern (2:00 p.m. Pacific) to discuss the
Company's fiscal 2005 first quarter results.  The conference call will be
accessible live via the Internet at www.aehr.com.  Please go to the website at
least fifteen minutes early to register, download and install any necessary
audio software.  A replay of the webcast will be available for 90 days.

ABOUT AEHR TEST SYSTEMS
Headquartered in Fremont, California, Aehr Test Systems is a leading worldwide
provider of systems for burning-in and testing DRAM and logic integrated
circuits and has an installed base of more than 2,000 systems worldwide.  Aehr
Test has developed and introduced several innovative products, including the
FOX, MTX, MAX3 and MAX4 systems, and the DiePak(R) carrier.  The FOX system is

MAX system can effectively burn-in and functionally test complex devices, such
as digital signal processors, microprocessors, microcontrollers and systems-on-
a-chip.  The DiePak carrier is a reusable, temporary package that enables IC
manufacturers to perform cost-effective final test and burn-in of bare die.

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT
This release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties relating to projections regarding industry growth and customer
demand for Aehr Test's products as well as projections regarding Aehr Test's

Aehr Test's products in fiscal year 2005.  See Aehr Test's most recent 10-K
