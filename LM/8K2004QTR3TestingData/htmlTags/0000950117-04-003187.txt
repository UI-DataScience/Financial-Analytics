                              EPS 70 Cents, Up 21%

LAKE FOREST, Calif., August 31, 2004 -- The Cooper Companies, Inc. (NYSE: COO)
today reported results for its fiscal third quarter ended July 31, 2004.

Third Quarter Highlights

     o    Revenue $129.1 million, 19% above the third quarter of 2003, 16% in
          constant currency.

     o    Operating income $31.7 million, 25% above the third quarter of 2003.

     o    EPS 70 cents versus 58 cents, up 21%; trailing twelve months $2.53.

     o    Cash flow (income before income taxes plus depreciation and
          amortization) per share 99 cents, up from 84 cents in the third
          quarter of 2003; trailing twelve months $3.67.

Revenue and Earnings Per Share Guidance

     o   Cooper now expects fiscal 2004 revenue of $488 million to $493
         million, assuming no major changes in exchange rates, and earnings per
         share of $2.59 to $2.61 assuming an effective tax rate or ETR
         (provision for taxes divided by income before taxes) of 21%. The
         previous fiscal 2004 guidance was revenue of $483 to $493 and earnings
         per share of $2.55 to $2.58 with an ERT of 22%.

         Expecting continued strong worldwide sales of specialty contact lenses,
         CooperVision (CVI) anticipates fiscal 2004 revenue of $387 million to
         $390 million, assuming no major changes in exchange rates.
         CooperSurgical (CSI), the Company's women's healthcare medical device
         business, expects revenue of $101 million to $103 million for fiscal
         2004.

     o   For the fourth fiscal quarter, Cooper expects revenue of $128 million
         to $133 million--$102 million to $105 million for CVI and $26 million
         to $28 million for CSI--with earnings per share of 70 cents to 72
         cents. Cooper had not previously issued guidance for its fiscal fourth
         quarter.

                                                                          Page 1





<PAGE>

     o    Revenue and earnings per share guidance for the years 2005 through
          2007 that reflect Cooper's recently announced proposed acquisition of
          Ocular Sciences, Inc. are below in "Proposed Acquisition of Ocular
          Sciences, Inc." It assumes, for the purpose of these projections, that
          the transaction closes on November 1, 2004. It does not include the
          impact of a proposed amendment to Financial Accounting Standards Board
          (FASB) Statement No. 128 "Earnings Per Share" which is discussed
          below.

     o    The guidance above assumes no major change in exchange rates and is
          exclusive of nonrecurring charges for acquisition accounting and
          restructuring.

Third Quarter 2004 Revenue and Expense Summary

Cooper's third quarter revenue of $129.1 million was 19% above last year's third
quarter, 16% in constant currency. Gross margin was 64% in the current quarter
versus 63% in last year's third quarter.

Selling, general and administrative expense grew 18% and was 38% of revenue, the
same as in last year's third quarter. Corporate expense decreased to $2.5
million, down 26% from the third quarter of 2003, as expenses to maintain
Cooper's global trading arrangement declined.

Operating income grew 25% and improved to 25% of revenue versus 23% in last
year's third quarter. Total operating expenses were 40% of revenue, the same as
in last year's third quarter.

                                                                          Page 2





<PAGE>


Currency fluctuations did not significantly impact operating income in the
quarter. Because CVI manufactures the majority of its lenses in the United
Kingdom with costs denominated in pounds sterling, and CSI imports some of its
products from Europe and Canada, the unfavorable currency translation of
manufacturing and operating costs tends to offset the currency gains on overseas
revenue.

Income before taxes grew 24%, despite $456 thousand of foreign exchange loss
compared to $282 thousand of foreign exchange gain in the prior year. Interest
expense fell 12%, reflecting both a general decrease in interest rates and the
Company's refinancing of part of its higher interest debt in the third quarter
of 2003.

Because accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require
the projected fiscal year ETR to be used when reporting year-to-date results,
the ETR was decreased to 22% in the second fiscal quarter reflecting the
favorable shift of business through jurisdictions with lower tax rates. The 19%
ETR in the third quarter reflects the 22% ETR and a release from reserves of
about $700 thousand. Cooper now expects that the ETR for fiscal 2004 and the
fourth quarter of 2004 will be 21% and 22%, respectively.

Compared to the third quarter of 2003, the number of shares used to calculate
diluted earnings per share increased 5% to 34.1 million shares.

Without the contribution of the $700 thousand tax adjustment and the foreign
exchange losses, third quarter earnings per share would have been 69 cents.

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights

     o    At the end of the third fiscal quarter, Cooper's days sales
          outstanding (DSO) decreased to 62 days from 66 days a year ago due to
          improved collection of both CVI domestic and international
          receivables. Cooper expects future DSO to generally be in the mid to
          upper 60's.

     o    Capital expenditures were $11.3 million in the quarter, primarily to
          expand manufacturing capacity and continue the rollout of new
          information systems in selected locations. Cooper expects capital
          expenditures in fiscal 2004 of $40 million to $45 million as it
          doubles its U.K. manufacturing capacity to meet increasing demand.

     o    Depreciation and amortization was $4.0 million for the quarter.

CooperVision

"In our third quarter, CVI continued to grow faster than both the worldwide
contact lens market and our competitors' results reported for the second
calendar quarter," said A. Thomas Bender, Cooper's chief executive officer.

 "Our specialty lens franchise--toric, cosmetic, and multifocal lenses and
lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms--continues to gain momentum, while our
value-added monthly disposable spherical and aspherical products continue to
capture market share from two-week commodity disposable spherical lenses.

"CVI's global toric revenue, 41% of our soft contact lens business, grew 23%
over the third quarter of 2003 and 25% year to date.

"The market remains robust. During the second calendar quarter, contact lens
revenue worldwide reported by the five leading contact lens manufacturers grew
15%--10% in constant currency--and increased 13% in the United States according
to independent market research data.

"Through six months, the data indicates that the global market has grown 9% in
constant currency and the U.S. market has grown 11%."

Third Quarter and Year-To-Date CooperVision Worldwide Highlights

     o    CVI's worldwide revenue of $102.8 million grew 17% over last year's
          third quarter--13% in constant currency--and is 19% ahead for the
          year--13% in constant currency.

     o    CVI's specialty lenses--toric, cosmetic, multifocal lenses and lenses
          to alleviate dry eye symptoms--grew 22% over last year's third quarter
          and accounted for nearly two-thirds of its global soft lens business.
          Year to date, specialty lens revenue is ahead 25%.

     o    Sales of toric lenses, which correct astigmatism, increased 23% over
          the third quarter of 2003 and accounted for 40% of CVI's global
          contact lens revenue. Year to date, toric products have grown 25%. All
          disposable toric products, the fastest growing toric lenses, grew 40%
          in the quarter and now represent about three-quarters of CVI's
          worldwide toric sales.

     o    Disposable spheres, 45% of soft lens revenue, grew 15% over last
          year's third quarter and are ahead 22% year to date.


                                                                          Page 4





<PAGE>


Third Quarter and Year-To-Date Geographic Revenue Highlights

     o    In the United States, CVI's revenue, 48% of its business, grew 15%
          over the third quarter of 2003 and is ahead 14% year to date. Revenue
          outside of the United States grew 19% over 2003's third quarter and
          24% year to date.

     o    European revenue, 38% of CVI's total revenue, grew 19% over the third
          quarter of 2003 and is ahead 25% for the nine-month period.

     o    Asia-Pacific revenue grew 43% over last year's third quarter and now
          represents 5% of CVI's worldwide business. Year to date, Asia-Pacific
          sales are 29% ahead of last year.

     o    Revenue in all other markets outside the United States, 9% of CVI's
          revenue, grew 9% over 2003's third quarter and is ahead 18% year to
          date.

CVI New Products

So far this year, CVI has introduced its two-week disposable toric lens in Japan
and Proclear disposable multifocal in major European markets. The Proclear
multifocal launch in North America is scheduled in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004.

CVI Third Quarter Expense Highlights

CVI's operating margin in the third quarter was 28% versus 27% in last year's
third quarter.

Gross margin was 67% of revenue compared to 66% in the prior year's third
quarter. Because CVI manufactures the majority of its lenses in the United
Kingdom, the favorable impact of currency on revenue tends to be offset by the
unfavorable translation of manufacturing and operating costs outside the United
States. The effect of currency on operating income in the quarter was not
significant.

SG&A expense grew 18% during the quarter compared to revenue growth of 17%.

Proposed Acquisition of Ocular Sciences, Inc.

In July, Cooper and Ocular Sciences, Inc.(Nasdaq: OCLR) announced that they had
signed a definitive agreement for Cooper to acquire Ocular in a merger in which
Ocular stockholders will be entitled to receive 0.3879 of a share of Cooper
common stock and $22.00 in cash, without interest, for each share of Ocular
common stock they own.

At closing, expected in the first quarter of Cooper's 2005 fiscal year, which
begins on November 1, 2004, Cooper will pay approximately $600 million in cash
and issue approximately 10.5 million shares of its common stock to Ocular
Sciences stockholders and option holders.

Completion of the transaction, which has been unanimously approved by the boards
of directors of both companies, is subject to customary closing conditions,
including approvals of each company's stockholders and expiration of the waiting
period required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and
approval of the Company's registration statement by the Securities and Exchange
Commission. No other regulatory approvals are required prior to closing.


                                                                          Page 5

CooperSurgical

Revenue at CSI, Cooper's women's healthcare medical device business, grew 27%
over last year's third quarter to $26.3 million with organic growth of 6%. CSI's
operating margin was 20% for the quarter, down from 23% in the third quarter of
2003, reflecting integration expenses of two recent acquisitions - SURx and
Milex - and increased marketing expenditures.

CSI plans to increase marketing expenses over the next 12 to 18 months for
programs designed to increase the organic growth of its business. These programs
will focus on CSI's products in the incontinence, infertility and female
sterilization markets using its restructured sales force of 175 independent and
direct sales representatives.

Convertible Senior 2.625% Debentures and Proposed Changes to FASB 128

In the third quarter of 2003, we issued $115 million of 2.625% contingently
convertible senior debentures due on July 1, 2023. The debentures are
convertible into 22.5201 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount
or approximately 2.6 million shares.

Because Cooper's share price has exceeded the conversion price specified for the
securities, earnings per share will be diluted to account for the additional
shares that could be issued beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter 2004. As the
Company has a right to and intends to redeem the principal for cash, current
accounting standards define the level of dilution as equal to the number of
shares that might become issued exclusive of the principal amount. This would
dilute fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 earnings per share by about 4 cents at
current share price levels. This estimated dilution is included in the fourth
quarter and fiscal 2004 earnings per share guidance and the 2005-2007 guidance
for the proposed combination of Cooper and Ocular.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued an Exposure Draft, "Earnings
Per Share - an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 128" that requires contracts with
an option to settle the principal in cash or stock to presume a stock settlement
for fully diluted earnings per share computations. If adopted, this could
require Cooper to include additional shares in the computation of diluted
earnings per share beginning in the fiscal first quarter 2005 and subsequent
periods and could also require the Company to restate prior period earnings per
share for the comparative amounts.

The proposed method could dilute Cooper's fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 fully
diluted earnings per share by 11 cents and 13 cents, respectively. The
incremental dilution between the current and the proposed accounting methods is
not included in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2004 earnings per share guidance
or the 2005-2007 guidance for the combination of Cooper and Ocular.


                                                                          Page 7

Earnings Per Share

All per share amounts in this news release refer to diluted per share amounts.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In this news release, we report Cooper's "cash flow per share" as 99 cents for
the third quarter of fiscal 2004, 84 cents for the third quarter of 2003 and
$3.67 for the 12 months ended July 31, 2004.

Although "cash flow per share" is a non-GAAP financial measure, we disclose it
because we think it is the most appropriate measure of our liquidity and
financial strength, particularly when calculated consistently over time.

In Cooper's case, cash flow per share is more informative than the more common
non-GAAP measure of liquidity called "earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization" (EBITDA) because unlike most companies, Cooper
does not expect to pay federal income taxes until about 2007, when we expect to
exhaust the usage of our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. Cooper has a
significant competitive advantage, as most companies expend a large portion of
their pretax profits on taxes. Readers should understand this and judge our
financial strength accordingly.

To calculate "cash flow per share," we add back non-cash charges for
depreciation and amortization to income before income taxes, and then divide the
result by the average number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per
share. In the tables below, we reconcile earnings per share (the closest GAAP
disclosure) to "cash flow per share" for all periods reported using the same
diluted per share figures.
