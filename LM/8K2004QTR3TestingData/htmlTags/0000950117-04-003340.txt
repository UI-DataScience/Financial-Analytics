                                                           585-264-3189



                  BIRDS EYE FOODS ANNOUNCES FISCAL 2004 RESULTS
                              NET INCOME INCREASES

ROCHESTER, NY, September 21, 2004...Birds Eye Foods, Inc., the nation's leader
in manufacturing and marketing frozen vegetables and a major processor of other
food products, today reported its fiscal 2004 results.

     Net income increased $11.1 million to $31.9 million from $20.8 million in
fiscal 2003. The increase is primarily driven by lower interest expense as a
result of the Company's efforts to reduce outstanding debt levels.

     Net sales for fiscal 2004 were approximately $843.4 million, a decline of
$19.6 million or 2.3%, as compared to $863.0 million in fiscal 2003. A majority
of the decline resulted from a decrease in non-branded product sales due to
continued efforts to rationalize certain product offerings. In addition, the
Birds Eye Voila! product line faced industry challenges last year which the
Company has actively addressed through a brand revitalization, including the
introduction of several reduced carbohydrate alternatives along with other new
flavor offerings and reformulated varieties. Net sales within the core Birds Eye
branded frozen vegetable business have remained strong, experiencing 3% growth
as compared to the prior year. The introduction of several value added vegetable
items led to this improvement.

     Dennis M. Mullen, Birds Eye Foods Chairman, President, and Chief Executive
Officer comments, "Our industry has been and continues to be faced with
challenges, including increases in costs for our ingredients, commodities and
packaging as well as health care costs." Mullen continues, "However, the
improvements we have made in our debt structure over the last two years have
allowed us to show growth in net income. We continue to focus our efforts in
fiscal 2005 on product innovation and other growth initiatives to bring to our
customers and consumers healthy, high quality, value-added products."

     Rochester-based Birds Eye Foods, with sales of approximately $1.0 billion
annually, processes fruits and vegetables in 14 facilities across the country.
Familiar brands in the frozen aisle include Birds Eye, Birds Eye Voila!, Birds
Eye Simply Grillin', Freshlike and McKenzie's. Other processed foods marketed by
Birds Eye Foods include fillings and toppings (Comstock and Wilderness); chili
and chili ingredients (Nalley and Brooks); salad dressings (Bernstein's and
Nalley) and snacks (Tim's and Snyder of Berlin). Birds Eye Foods also produces
many of these products for the store brands, food service and industrial
markets.

(a)  In order to provide a meaningful basis of comparing the Company's results
     of operations, the results of operations for the "predecessor" period (June
     30, 2002 to August 18, 2002) have been combined with the results of
     operations for the "successor" period (August 19, 2002 to June 28, 2003).

(b)  On November 24, 2003, the Company repurchased $150.0 million of its 11 7/8
     percent Senior Subordinated Notes. In conjunction with this repayment, a
     pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $4.0 million
     was recorded. This amount reflects the payment of the $8.9 million call
     premium and other transaction expenses less the elimination of the related
     unamortized premium of $4.9 million.

(c)  The Company has disposed of its Freshlike canned, Veg-All, popcorn, and
     applesauce operations. The implementation of SFAS No. 144 resulted in the
     classification and separate financial presentation of those businesses as
     discontinued operations and are, therefore, excluded from continuing
     operations.
