 AEP Industries Inc. Reports Fiscal 2004 Third Quarter and Nine Months Results

    SOUTH HACKENSACK, N.J., Sept. 13 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- AEP Industries
Inc. (Nasdaq: AEPI, the "Company") today reported financial results for its
fiscal third quarter and nine months ended July 31, 2004.

    Net sales rose 10.1 percent to $204,872,000 compared with $186,160,000 in
last year's fiscal third quarter.  Excluding $4,910,000 of positive impact of
foreign exchange, worldwide net sales increased $13,802,000 or 7.4 percent.
The increase in net sales during the 2004 third quarter was primarily driven
by a 10.7 percent increase in sales volume partially offset by a 3.0 percent
decrease in per unit selling prices.

    For the first three quarters of fiscal 2004, net sales increased 9.5
percent to $591,402,000 compared with $540,190,000 in the first nine months of
fiscal 2003.  Excluding $31,976,000 of positive impact of foreign exchange,
worldwide net sales increased $19,236,000 or 3.6 percent.  For the nine-month
period, the increase in net sales was primarily due to a 2.8 percent increase
in sales volume and a 0.8 percent increase in per unit selling prices.

    Gross profit percentage for the 2004 third quarter improved to 16.9
percent from 15.8 percent in the 2003 third quarter.  The $5,150,000
improvement in gross profit resulted from increased sales volume, primarily in
North America, and was partially offset by a slight decrease in per unit
selling prices.

    For the nine-month 2004 period, gross profit percentage improved to 17.5
percent from 16.5 percent in the same period last year.  The $14,200,000
increase in gross profit in the first nine months of 2004 is primarily a
result of a $3,940,000 positive impact of foreign exchange combined with
increased per unit selling prices and increased sales volumes, primarily in
North America.

    Operating expenses in the 2004 third quarter were $795,000 more than the
third quarter of 2003.  This increase in operating expenses includes a
negative impact of foreign exchange of $600,000 and $1,800,000 in increased
delivery costs attributable to increased sales volume and higher fuel costs
incurred during the period.  These expenses were partially offset by a net
cost reduction of $1,700,000 resulting from the liquidation of the Italian
operations ("FIAP") and the closedown of the United Kingdom operations in
2003.

    For the nine-month period, operating expenses increased $617,000 and
included $4,000,000 of negative impact of foreign exchange effect that was
offset by the net cost reduction of $4,300,000 resulting from the liquidation
of FIAP and the closedown of the United Kingdom operations in 2003.

    Income from continuing operations improved to $7,479,000 in the 2004 third
quarter compared with $2,900,000 in the 2003 third quarter.  This improvement
between the third quarters of fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 is primarily the
result of the previously mentioned improvement in sales volume, and the net
effect of the FIAP liquidation, which increased 2004 third quarter income from
operations by $271,000.

    The Company reported income from continuing operations of $24,300,000 for
the first nine months of fiscal 2004, compared with $10,679,000 in the same
period last year.  This improvement between the first nine months of 2004 and
the same period last year is primarily due to improved sales volume and
material margins, combined with the net effect of the FIAP liquidation, which
increased 2004 nine months income from operations by $2,087,000.

    In the 2004 third quarter, the Company had a net loss from continuing
operations of $1,918,000, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared with a net loss
from continuing operations of $2,122,000, or $0.26 per diluted share, in last
year's third quarter.  For the nine-month period, AEP reported a net loss from
continuing operations of $1,520,000, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared with
a net loss from continuing operations of $9,155,000, or $1.14 per diluted
share, for the first nine months of 2003.

    In July 2004, the Company's management approved a plan to sell its Spanish
subsidiary and took the first step, as previously announced, that on July 26,
2004, the Company's Spanish subsidiary filed for Suspension of Payments status
under Spanish law.  As a result, the Spanish operations are now accounted for
as discontinued operations.  For the third quarter 2004, the Company had a net
loss from discontinued operations of $9,654,000, or $1.15 per diluted share,
compared with a net income from discontinued operations of $89,000, or $0.01
per diluted share, in the 2003 third quarter.  For the 2004 nine month period,
the net loss from discontinued operations was $11,651,000, or $1.40 per
diluted share, compared to a net loss from discontinued operations of
$480,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the same period last year.

    For the 2004 third quarter the Company reported a net loss of $11,572,000,
or $1.38 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $2,033,000, or $0.25
per diluted share in the same quarter last year.

    The net loss for the first nine months of 2004 was $13,171,000, or $1.59
per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $9,635,000, or $1.20 per
diluted share in the first nine months of last year.

    "We are pleased with our North American operations which had increased
sales volumes and improvements in gross margins, primarily due to our
continuing ability to pass through increases in resin costs to our market
place.  We anticipate passing through price increases in our operations during
the fourth quarter of 2004.  This is essential to our effort towards improving
our overall profitability," commented Brendan Barba, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of the Company.

    "We are disappointed that our Spanish subsidiary filed for Suspension of
Payments.  Over the past few years we have had to make difficult decisions
about these components of our international operations and we will continue to
take the steps necessary to maximize the returns of the entire company,"
concluded Mr. Barba.
