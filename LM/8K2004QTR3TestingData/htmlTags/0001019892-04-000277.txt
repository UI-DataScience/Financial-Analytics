ITEM 2.02.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

On September 1, 2004, Delta Woodside Industries, Inc. (the "Company") issued a
financial results press release for the fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended
July 3, 2004. This press release is set forth in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current
Report and is incorporated herein by reference.

The information in this Item 2.02 and the Exhibit attached hereto shall not be
deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Act of 1934, nor
shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities
Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in
such filing.

ITEM 2.05.  COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES.

On August 31, 2004, the board of directors of the Company's wholly-owned
subsidiary Delta Mills, Inc. approved a contract dated August 24, 2004 for the
sale of its Furman plant for expected net proceeds of approximately $1.8
million. The sale is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to
close within 60 days of the date of the agreement. The Company announced the
closing of the Furman plant in fiscal 2002. Consummation of the sale under this
contract will complete the disposal of the plant and its related assets. Since
the sale price is approximately $847,000 less than the carrying amount of the
asset on the Company's books, the Company determined on August 31, 2004 to take
an impairment charge at July 3, 2004 with respect to the Furman plant of
approximately $847,000, which will result in a non-cash charge to earnings of
that amount for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 with respect to the Furman
plant. Other than customary closing costs which the Company does not consider
material, the Company does not expect there to be any further cash expenditures
related to the disposal of this asset.

ITEM 2.06.  MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS.

See the information set forth above under Item 2.05, which information is
incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 9.01.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.

(c)  Exhibits. The following exhibit attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed"
     for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Act of 1934, nor shall it be
     deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of
     1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such
     filing.

     99.1  Press release issued by Delta Woodside Industries, Inc. on September
           1, 2004.

PRESS RELEASE

September 1, 2004                                             W. H. Hardman, Jr.

                DELTA WOODSIDE INDUSTRIES, INC. ANNOUNCES CERTAIN
                   FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR 2004 RESULTS

         Delta Woodside Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ-OTC-BB-DLWI) reported net sales
of $45.4 million for the 14 week quarter ended July 3, 2004, a decrease of 6.8%
when compared to net sales of $48.7 million for the 13 week quarter ended June
28, 2003. The decrease from the prior year quarter was the result of a 15.8%
reduction in unit sales partially offset by a 10.1% increase in average sales
price. For the 53 week year ended July 3, 2004, the Company reported net sales
of $174.4 million as compared to net sales of $177.2 million for the previous 52
week year ended June 28, 2003. The decrease was the result of a 5.0% decline in
unit sales partially offset by 3.6% increase in average sales price. Unit sales
declined in both the quarter and year periods primarily as a result of weaker
retail sales partially offset by improved demand for military fabrics. Product
mix changes accounted for the increases in average sales price.

         The Company reported gross profit of $1.3 million for the quarter ended
July 3, 2004 compared to gross profit of $4.9 million in the prior year quarter.
This decrease was the result of reduced absorption of manufacturing costs due to
reduced running schedules and deteriorating margins on commodity products due to
continued pressure from imports coupled with over capacity of domestic textile
production, partially offset by an improved product mix. For the year ended July
3, 2004 the Company reported gross profit of $8.0 million compared to gross
profit of $17.0 million for the year ended June 28, 2003. This decrease for the
year resulted principally from unabsorbed manufacturing costs associated with
reduced running schedules brought on by reduced customer demand.

         Selling general and administrative expenses were $3.1 million for the
quarter ended July 3, 2004 compared to $2.9 million in the prior year quarter.
This increase was primarily due to the extra week of expenses in the current
year 14 week quarter. Selling general and administrative expenses were $11.8
million for the year ended July 3, 2004 compared to $11.4 million for the prior
year. This increase was primarily due to the extra week of expenses in the
current year coupled with increased credit insurance costs associated with
increased sales to customers based in the Caribbean.

         Interest expense was $1.2 million for the quarter ended July 3, 2004
compared to $1.2 million in the prior year quarter. Interest expense was $4.9
million for the year ended July 3, 2004 compared to $5.3 million for the prior
year. At July 3, 2004, the Company's subsidiary Delta Mills, Inc. was in
compliance with the covenants under its revolving credit facility, as amended,
and with the covenants of its senior notes indenture dated August 25, 1997.
Delta Mills, Inc. has made the September 1, 2004 semi-annual interest payment
required by the senior notes indenture. At July 3, 2004, the Company had unused

<PAGE>

availability under its revolving credit facility of $12.6 million. Subsequent to
July 3, 2004, the Company entered into further amendments to its revolving
credit facility pursuant to which the maximum availability was reduced to $38
million and the maximum leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants
were replaced with a minimum EBITDA covenant. The new covenant sets required
minimum EBITDA levels for each quarter end of fiscal 2005 and provides that it
will constitute an event of default if the Company and its lender fail to agree
by the end of fiscal year 2005 to minimum EBITDA levels for the remainder of the
term of the revolving credit facility. This amendment would not have changed the
unused availability under the revolving credit facility as of July 3, 2004.

         The Company has recently entered into a contract to sell its Furman
plant, which had been held for sale since fiscal year 2002. This contract has
required the Company to record a fiscal 2004 year end impairment charge
associated with this asset of approximately $847,000.

         Due to continuing challenges in the domestic marketplace coupled with
the uncertainties associated with the pending elimination of quotas in January
2005, the Company is in the process of evaluating its projections for fiscal
2005, which are necessary to determine certain impairment charge estimates and
other assumptions for fiscal year 2004. Pending the outcome of these
evaluations, the Company is not at this time in a position to release further
financial information with respect to fiscal 2004, and will not be holding a
conference call with respect to its fiscal year 2004 results until following the
filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2004 due October 1,
2004. The Company believes, however, that the financial information set forth in
this press release is unlikely to change materially as a result of these
evaluations.

         The preceding discussion contains certain "forward-looking statements".
These are based on the Company's expectations and are necessarily dependent upon
assumptions, estimates and data that the Company believes are reasonable and
accurate but may be incorrect, incomplete or imprecise. Forward-looking
statements are also subject to a number of business risks and uncertainties, any
of which could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in
or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties
include, among others, changes in the retail demand for apparel products, the
cost of raw materials, competitive conditions in the apparel and textile
industries, the relative strength of the United States dollar as against other
currencies, changes in United States and international trade regulations,
including without limitation the expected end of quotas on textile and apparel
products among World Trade Organization (WTO) member states in 2005, and the
discovery of unknown conditions (such as with respect to environmental matters
and similar items). Accordingly, any forward-looking statements do not purport
to be predictions of future events or circumstances and may not be realized.

         The Company does not undertake to publicly update or revise the
forward-looking statements even if it becomes clear that any projected results
will not be realized.

         Delta Woodside Industries, Inc., headquartered in Greenville, South
Carolina, manufactures and sells textile products for the apparel industry. The
Company, which employs approximately 1,500 people, operates five plants located
in South Carolina.
