                    KIRKLAND'S REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS


JACKSON, Tenn. (August 26, 2004)-- Kirkland's, Inc. (NASDAQ/NM: KIRK) today
reported financial results for the 13-week and 26-week periods ended July 31,
2004.

         Net sales for the 13 weeks ended July 31, 2004, increased 7.3% to $84.7
million from $79.0 million for the 13 weeks ended August 2, 2003. Comparable
store sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 decreased 3.4% compared with a
0.9% decrease for the second quarter of fiscal 2003. The Company reported a net
loss of $2.7 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the second quarter of
fiscal 2004 compared with net income of $764,000, or $0.04 per diluted share for
the second quarter of fiscal 2003.

         Net sales for the 26 weeks ended July 31, 2004, increased 9.8% to
$167.3 million from $152.4 million for the 26 weeks ended August 2, 2003.
Comparable store sales for the first half of 2004 decreased 1.0% compared with a
1.9% increase in the prior-year period. The Company reported a net loss of $1.8
million, or $0.09 per diluted share, for the first half of 2004 compared with
net income of $1.9 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the prior-year
period.

         Robert E. Alderson, Kirkland's President and Chief Executive Officer,
said, "Our final results for the quarter were in line with the revised
expectations we issued in July. Consistent with trends that began in late April,
the second quarter was characterized by weak customer traffic and lower
transaction volumes compared with a year ago. Such results point to the need for
new ideas and initiatives in merchandising and marketing. Recent additions to
our merchandising and marketing teams, along with our search for a senior
merchandising executive, are significant and positive steps in that direction.
Efforts are already underway to improve buying and planning practices and to
provide a more focused merchandise offering. We also will communicate more
frequently with our customers, as we seek to renew the excitement and enthusiasm
that has long made Kirkland's a favored destination for stylish home decor at
great prices."

Third Quarter and Fiscal 2004 Outlook

         The Company issued guidance for the third quarter ending October 30,
2004, of a net loss of $0.10 to a net loss of $0.15 per diluted share, compared
with earnings of $0.10 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Net sales are
expected to be $82 million to $86 million, with a comparable store sales
decrease of 10% to 15% compared with an increase of 2.7% in the prior-year
period.

         Based on its third quarter guidance and current business outlook, the
Company now expects to report earnings for fiscal 2004 in a range of $0.45 to
$0.55 per diluted share and net sales of approximately $395 million to $405
million. Comparable store sales are estimated to be down 2% to 5% when compared
with the prior year. The Company's fiscal 2004 estimate includes 50 to 55 new
store openings and 10 to 15 store closings as well as the collective impact of
transition costs relating to the Company's new distribution center and the
implementation of a wide-area network linking the Company's stores and corporate
headquarters.

         Mr. Alderson commented, "Sales thus far in August have slowed
considerably in comparison to the trends we experienced in the second quarter.
Customer traffic remains a concern, particularly in our mall stores, and our
current inventory mix does not position us well against strong merchandise
events that we ran during last year's third quarter. Accordingly, we are not
optimistic that we can produce positive comparable store sales in the near term.
On a more positive note, our aggressive markdown stance during June and July has
left our inventories in good shape, and the real estate team has kept our
development plan on track for a net increase of 40 stores during fiscal 2004.

         "Our merchandising, marketing, store operations and logistics teams are
committed to reversing these business trends as rapidly as possible and
improving the productivity of our new distribution center to optimally support
our stores for the fourth quarter. While we hope to accomplish much over the
next several months, it is difficult to definitively predict at this point when
we will see tangible results. We have therefore adopted a cautious outlook for
the balance of the year.

         "Looking ahead to fiscal 2005, Kirkland's continues to be a sound
concept with tremendous growth potential. We are confident in our real estate
strategy, and we expect significant benefits from the modernization of our
supply chain and other initiatives to address the inconsistent sales and margin
results that have characterized our business for the past 18 months."
