SunLink Health Systems, Inc. Announces Fiscal 2004 Annual and Fourth Quarter
Results

     ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 21, 2004--SunLink Health Systems, Inc.
(AMEX: SSY) today announced net earnings of $14,305,000 or $2.03 per fully
diluted share for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, compared to net earnings of
$461,000 or $0.09 per fully diluted share for the quarter ended June 30, 2003.
For the year ended June 30, 2004, SunLink reported net earnings of $13,426,000
or $2.15 per fully diluted share compared to net earnings of $553,000 or $0.10
per fully diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2003. An after-tax gain
included in discontinued operations of approximately $16,366,000 on the sale of
SunLink's Mountainside Medical Center is included in the results for the quarter
and year ended June 30, 2004.
     SunLink reported a loss from continuing operations for its fourth fiscal
quarter ended June 30, 2004 of $1,087,000 or a loss of $0.15 per fully diluted
share compared to earnings of $849,000 or $0.16 per fully diluted share for the
quarter ended June 30, 2003. For the year ended June 30, 2004, SunLink reported
a loss from continuing operations of $1,267,000 or a loss of $0.20 per fully
diluted share compared to earnings from continuing operations of $1,560,000 or
$0.29 per share for the year ended June 30, 2003. Included in the loss from
continuing operations for the quarter and year ended June 30, 2004 is $1,904,000
of loss related to the early repayment of debt.
     The Company's operating profit from continuing operations for the quarter
ended June 30, 2004 was $909,000 (which includes $397,000 from the HealthMont
facilities which were acquired in October 2003) compared to an operating profit
for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 of $1,317,000. Operating profit for the
quarter ended June 30, 2003 included $1,026,000 for positive prior year
third-party payor settlements. The quarter ended June 30, 2004 had no prior year
third-party payor settlements. The operating profit for the year ended June 30,
2004 was $4,315,000 compared to $4,702,000 for the year ended June 30, 2003. The
operating profit of the HealthMont facilities for the year ended June 30, 2004
was $53,000.
     Consolidated net revenues from continuing operations for the quarters ended
June 30, 2004 and 2003 were $31,000,000 and $21,289,000, respectively, an
increase of 45.6% in the current year's quarter. The increased net revenues
resulted from a 21.3% increase in same store equivalent admissions, a 19.7%
increase in same store surgeries, an 11.6% increase in same store admissions and
the net revenues from the two HealthMont hospitals acquired in October 2003. Net
revenues excluding the two newly acquired HealthMont hospitals increased
$2,066,000 or 9.7% in the current year's quarter compared to the prior year
fourth quarter.
     Consolidated net revenues from continuing operations for the fiscal years
ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 were $112,436,000 and $80,742,000, respectively, an
increase of 39.3% in the current year. The increased net revenues resulted
primarily from the two HealthMont hospitals acquired in October 2003, a 15.4%
increase in same store equivalent admissions, a 14.1% increase in same store
admissions and a 6.1% increase in same store surgeries. Net revenues excluding
the two newly acquired HealthMont hospitals increased $9,938,000 or 12.3% in the
current year compared to the prior year.
     In the year ended June 30, 2004, earnings from discontinued operations of
$14,693,000 resulted primarily from the gain on the sale of Mountainside Medical
Center in June 2004. In the year ended June 30, 2003, the Company reported a
loss from discontinued operations of $1,007,000 which included a $1,562,000
asset impairment charge related to Mountainside Medical Center.
     Robert M. Thornton, chief executive officer of SunLink, stated, "By
maintaining our focus on SunLink's core competency in exurban and rural
communities, our hospitals have generated strong growth. This has been
complemented by the HealthMont acquisition and our ability to attract and retain
an exceptional group of physicians and support staff at all of our facilities.
Over the past 24 months, the company added 45 net additional physicians to the
medical staffs of its hospitals (including five additional physicians in the
most recently completed quarter) who contributed to much of the increased
volume." Thornton continued, "We continue to be committed to organic growth and
will continue to seek new opportunities to increase our hospital portfolio
through a disciplined acquisition program."
     SunLink Health Systems, Inc. currently operates seven community hospitals
and related businesses in the Southeast and Midwest. Each SunLink facility is
