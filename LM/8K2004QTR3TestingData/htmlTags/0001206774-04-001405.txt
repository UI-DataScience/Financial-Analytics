                        Tektronix Reports Results for the
                          First Quarter of Fiscal 2005

                 Delivers Exceptional Earnings on Strong Sales

BEAVERTON, Ore., Sept. 16, 2004 - Tektronix, Inc. (NYSE: TEK) today reported net
sales of $250.5 million and net earnings from continuing operations of $36.5
million or $0.43 per share for the first quarter ended August 28, 2004. This
compares with net sales of $201.4 million and net earnings from continuing
operations of $11.4 million or $0.13 per share for the same period last year.
Excluding business realignment and one-time items, net earnings from continuing
operations were $36.9 million or $0.43 per share for the first quarter ended
August 28, 2004, as compared with $15.7 million or $0.18 per share for the same
period last year.

"This was another great quarter for Tektronix. We saw sales growth of 24%, net
earnings that were considerably higher than the first quarter of last year and
orders that were in line with our expectations," said Rick Wills, Tektronix
Chairman and CEO. "We are very pleased with our strong operational results this
quarter driven largely by our gross margin improvement efforts as well as our
operating leverage."

"From a regional standpoint, we continued to see solid demand for our products,
especially in Japan and Asia/Pacific," continued Wills. "Our oscilloscope
products showed excellent growth, further demonstrating positive customer
response to new products introduced during the last fiscal year."

"During the quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire Inet Technologies, a
leading global provider of communications software solutions that enable network
operators to more strategically and profitably operate their businesses.
Combining Inet with our mobile protocol test products is a key strategic move
which should enable us to grow and enhance our already strong leadership
position in this market. We expect the transaction to close on September 30,
2004," continued Wills.

Tektronix First Quarter 2005 Results.../2

For the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the company expects net sales to be $235
- - $245 million and earnings per share from continuing operations of $.30 to
$.35, excluding business realignment and one-time items and the impact of the
acquisition of Inet Technologies.

 "We are encouraged by the success we are seeing and believe our growth strategy
of investing in our four core product categories and two new product categories
is paying off as we strengthen our competitive position in each," concluded
Wills.

Recent highlights include the following:

o    The introduction of a High Definition (HD) Rasterizer, the WVR7100, which
     monitors the quality of high-definition content to meet the demands of
     broadcasters and video editors. With the WVR7100 Rasterizer, HD, standard
     definition, and composite analog signals, as well as digital and analog
     audio can be all monitored from one instrument.

o    The purchase by Xerox Corporation of 114 Tektronix Digital Phosphor
     Oscilloscopes for use throughout the company. Of the chosen instruments, 91
     are the new TDS5000B with MyScope(TM), the industry's first customizable
     user interface.

o    The announcement that the Department of Ion Physics at Uppsala University
     in Sweden selected Tektronix' oscilloscopes for use in tests on particle
     accelerators. The facility is one of the world's leading centers for
     research into the use of mass spectrometry for radionuclide dating and
     ion-beam based material analysis.

o    The announcement that NVIDIA Corporation, a worldwide leader in visual
     processing solutions, was able to expedite time to market for its GeForce 6
     series of graphics solutions based on PCI Express(TM) by using an automated
     test suite consisting of the Tektronix TMS817 PCI Express support for the
     TLA700 logic analyzer, TDS6000 Series digital storage oscilloscope, P7380
     Series probes, and RT-Eye(TM) test software.

Tektronix will be discussing its first quarter results and future guidance on a
conference call today, beginning at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time (PDT). A
live Webcast of the conference call will be available at www.tektronix.com/ir. A
replay of the Webcast will be available at the same Web site through Friday,
September 16, 2005.

Tektronix presents pro forma measures of net earnings and net earnings per share
from continuing operations that exclude the effects of business realignment and
one-time items. The "Reconciliation of Pro Forma Measures to GAAP" reconciles
the results of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) to the pro forma results of operations. Tektronix presents pro
forma results of operations to help readers differentiate the results of ongoing
operating activity from results that include business realignment costs and
one-time items. Management of Tektronix uses these pro forma measures to
evaluate the Company's results of operations and for forecasting purposes.

Statements and information in this press release that relate to future events or
results (including the Company's statements and expectations regarding the
effect of the Inet acquisition, sales, earnings per share, market position,
market growth opportunities and new products) are based on the Company's current
expectations. They constitute forward-looking statements subject to a number of
risk factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those
currently expected or desired. Those factors include: worldwide geopolitical and
economic conditions; business conditions in the electronics, communications,
computer and advanced technologies industries, changes in order rates and
customer cancellations, including changes in seasonal buying habits; competitive
factors, including pricing pressures, technological developments and
