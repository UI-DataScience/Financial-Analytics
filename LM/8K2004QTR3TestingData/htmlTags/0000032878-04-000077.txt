                 ECD ANNOUNCES AUDITED YEAR-END OPERATING RESULTS
                 ------------------------------------------------

      ROCHESTER HILLS, Mich., Sept. 13, 2004 - Energy Conversion Devices, Inc.
(NASDAQ:ENER) today reported audited financial results for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2004.  The Company reported a loss of $51.4 million on revenues of
$66.3 million, compared to a loss of $36.2 million on revenues of $65.2 million
in fiscal year 2003.  On a per-share basis, the loss was $2.15 in 2004 compared
to a loss of $1.65 in 2003.

     The increased operating loss in 2004 versus 2003 was primarily due to lower
revenues from product development activities and equipment contracts with Rare
Earth Ovonic, and higher costs for patent defense, the inclusion of a full year
of operating results for United Solar Ovonic and a decrease in revenues from
license agreements, partially offset by higher royalties.

      The table below summarizes the Company's operating results (in thousands):

                                                  Year Ended June 30,

     "Our goal is to move the Company into sustained profitability by July 2006.
This will be accomplished by transitioning from a highly successful R&D Company
to accelerating the commercialization of the products and technologies we have
developed in the fields of energy and information," Robert C. Stempel, Chairman
and CEO, said. "The plan is to grow the solar, battery and OUM businesses; move
our hydrogen and other technologies into the commercial stage; achieve cost
reductions across the enterprise; and capitalize the business for the
transition. At the same time, we will continue our valuable materials research
and technology development to enhance our product portfolio in future years."

     Product sales increased principally due to increased sales by United Solar
Ovonic LLC, as well as the effect of consolidating United Solar Ovonic's
operations after the May 14, 2003 acquisition. United Solar Ovonic's thin-film
triple-junction solar products continue to receive worldwide acceptance. Our
bookings indicate a continuing trend of revenue growth with recent orders such
as the 300kW photovoltaic system for the Beijing New Capital Museum, an order
for 2.4MW from Solar Integrated Technologies and an additional order of 750kW
from Alwitra of Germany increasing sales to Alwitra in 2004 to 1.5MW.

     Revenues from product development agreements decreased as a result of lower
revenues received related to battery R&D as Cobasys, our battery manufacturing
joint venture, moves into production, together with decreases in our funded
programs in fuel cell and hydrogen technologies, partially offset by United
Solar Ovonic's revenues from its contract with the U.S. Air Force Research
Laboratory.

     In May 2004 United Solar Ovonic was awarded a $4.02 million, 18-month
contract to develop new solar cell technology to be used in space and airship
vehicles addressing defense and homeland security applications. This contract
builds upon the success of an $11.5 million contract awarded in May 2003 by the
Air Force.

     In July 2004, ECD and Cobasys LLC entered into a settlement agreement with
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. (MEI), Panasonic EV Energy Co., Ltd.
(PEVE), and Toyota Motor Corporation with respect to patent infringement
disputes and counterclaims involving Ovonic nickel metal hydride (NiMH)
batteries before the International Chamber of Commerce, International Court of
Arbitration. Under the terms of the settlement, no party admitted any liability.
Also, Cobasys and PEVE will cross license each other for current and future
patents to avoid possible future litigation. Cobasys and PEVE have agreed to a
technical cooperation agreement to advance the state-of-the-art of NiMH
batteries which are widely used in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Cobasys and
PEVE have also established a joint development program to collaborate on the
development of next-generation high performance NiMH batteries for HEVs.

     The year-end results exclude the funds received under the battery
settlement with MEI, PEVE and Toyota, which will be recorded in the first
quarter of fiscal year 2005.

     In August 2004, Cobasys announced its complete line of advanced Ovonic
NiMH-based NiMHax(R) battery packs for all transportation applications ranging
from 144 volts and 30kW for light-duty automotive applications to 672 volts and
280kW for large commercial applications (trucks and buses). Cobasys is poised to
take advantage of the emerging hybrid electric vehicle market with its new
170,000 square foot state-of-the-art battery production facility with new
automated manufacturing equipment in Springboro, Ohio. The new facility is ISO
and QS certified and is capable of producing 1.2 million battery modules
annually at full capacity when fully equipped.

     Ovonyx continues to make good progress in the commercialization of its OUM
technology. In August 2004, Ovonyx announced the signing of a license agreement
with Nanochip, Inc. granting it the right to use the Ovonyx memory technology in
its Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS)-based, ultra-high density data
storage systems.
