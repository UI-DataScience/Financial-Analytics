                 LEHMAN BROTHERS REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS

                  -Net Income of $505 Million and EPS of $1.71-

NEW YORK, September 21, 2004 -- Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (ticker symbol:
LEH) today reported net income of $505 million for the third quarter ended
August 31, 2004, or $1.71 per common share (diluted), versus net income of $480
million, or $1.81 per common share (diluted) for the third quarter of fiscal
2003. Second quarter 2004 net income was $609 million, or $2.01 per common share
(diluted).

For the first nine months of 2004, net income was a record $1.8 billion, or
$5.94 per common share (diluted), increases of 46% and 28%, respectively, from
$1.2 billion, or $4.63 per common share (diluted) for the comparable period of
2003.

                               Business Highlights

o        Earned net income in excess of $500 million for third straight quarter

o        Achieved record net income and net revenues for the first nine months
         of 2004; greater than full-year 2003's results

o        Ranked No. 1 by Greenwich Associates for overall quality of Fixed
         Income sales, trading and research for the fourth consecutive year

<PAGE>


o        Ranked No. 1 in Institutional Investor's "2004 All-America Fixed Income
         Research Team" survey for the fifth year in a row

o        Achieved market share gains in calendar 2004 in key investment banking
         products, including M&A advisory and global equity origination

o        Named a qualified foreign institutional investor in China, which will
         allow the Firm to trade yuan-denominated securities

Richard S. Fuld, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Our
businesses performed well during the third quarter, despite the pressures of a
more challenging market environment. With revenues and net income for the first
nine months of 2004 already ahead of our full-year 2003 results, we are on our
way to another outstanding year."

Net revenues (total revenues less interest expense) for the third quarter rose
12% to $2.6 billion, up from $2.3 billion in the third quarter of 2003, and down
10% from $2.9 billion in the second quarter of 2004. Capital Markets revenues
rose 2% compared with the third quarter of 2003, reflecting a 16% rise in Fixed
Income Capital Markets, partially offset by a 33% decline in Equities Capital
Markets.Fixed Income Capital Markets revenues remained resilient, due in part to
robust mortgage and asset-backed securitization activity, which helped offset
reduced activity in investment grade debt and interest rate products. Equities
Capital Markets revenues were impacted by low trading volumes and volatility, as
well as a valuation decline in the global equity markets, which were adversely
affected by geopolitical concerns, higher oil prices, mixed economic data and
the seasonal summer slowdown. Investment Banking revenues rose 16% from the
third quarter of 2003, driven by increased equity and debt origination fees and
enhanced levels of M&A advisory activity. Revenues from Client Services rose 75%
from the same quarter last year, reflecting the positive impact of the
acquisition of Neuberger Berman.

For the first nine months of 2004, net revenues increased 37%, to a record $8.7
billion, from $6.3 billion for the first nine months of 2003.

Non-interest expenses for the quarter were $1.9 billion, compared to $1.6
billion in the 2003 third quarter and $2.0 billion in the trailing quarter of
2004. Compensation and benefits as a percentage of net revenues was 49.8% during
the third quarter of 2004, compared to 50.0% during the third quarter of 2003
and 49.8% in the second quarter of 2004. Non-personnel expenses in the 2004
third quarter were $594 million, compared with $424 million in the

                                       2
<PAGE>

previous year's third quarter, largely reflecting a number of acquisitions
completed subsequent to the third quarter of 2003. Non-personnel expenses were
$585 million in the second quarter of 2004.

For the quarter ended August 31, 2004, the Firm's pretax margin was 27.6%,
compared to 31.9% in the 2003 third quarter. For the 2004 third quarter, the
Firm's return on average common equity was 15.0%, compared to 20.7% in the 2003
third quarter, and return on average tangible common equity was 20.9% for the
third quarter of 2004, compared with 21.2% in the third quarter of 2003.

As of August 31, 2004, Lehman Brothers stockholders' equity totaled $14.4
billion, and total capital (stockholders' equity and long-term debt) was
approximately $64.5 billion. Book value per common share was $48.10.

FOOTNOTES TO SELECTED STATISTICAL INFORMATION
(Preliminary and Unaudited)

(a)  For the quarter ended February 29, 2004 net income includes a $19 million
     pre-tax ($11 million after tax) charge related to reconfiguration of
     certain of the Company's real estate.
(b)  For the quarter ended February 29, 2004 basic EPS and diluted EPS were
     reduced by $0.04 as a result of the real estate charge.
(c)  Return on average common stockholders' equity is computed by dividing
     annualized net income applicable to common stock for the period by average
     common stockholders' equity. (See the reconciliation on page 10.) For the
     quarter ended November 30, 2003 average common stockholders' equity was
     appropriately weighted for the effect of the equity issued in connection
     with the Neuberger Berman Inc. acquisition on October 31, 2003. For the
     quarter ended February 29, 2004 return on average common stockholders'
     equity was reduced by 0.4% as a result of the real estate charge.
(d)  Return on average tangible common stockholders' equity is computed by
     dividing annualized net income applicable to common stock for the period by
     average tangible common stockholders' equity. Tangible common stockholders'
     equity equals total common stockholders' equity less identifiable
     intangible assets and goodwill. (See the reconciliation on page 10.) For
     the quarter ended November 30, 2003 average tangible common stockholders'
     equity was appropriately weighted for the effect of the equity issued in
     connection with the Neuberger Berman Inc. acquisition on October 31, 2003.
     Management believes average tangible common stockholders' equity is a
     meaningful measure because it reflects the common stockholders' equity
     deployed in the Company's businesses. For the quarter ended February 29,
     2004 return on average tangible common stockholders' equity was reduced by
     0.5% as a result of the real estate charge.
(e)  Pretax margin for the quarter ended February 29, 2004 was reduced by
     approximately 0.6% as a result of the real estate charge.
(f)  The effective tax rate for the quarter ended February 29, 2004 was reduced
     by approximately 0.2% as a result of the real estate charge.
(g)  Net assets represents total assets excluding cash and securities segregated
     and on deposit for regulatory and other purposes, secured financing
     arrangements, collateral received recognized in inventory pursuant to SFAS
     140 and identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. (See the
     reconciliation on page 12.) Net leverage is defined as net assets divided
     by tangible equity capital. (See the reconciliation on page 12.) The
     Company believes net assets and net leverage are useful to investors when
     comparing companies in the securities industry because they exclude certain
     assets considered to have a low risk profile. The Company believes tangible
     equity capital to be a more meaningful measure of the Company's equity for
     purposes of calculating net leverage because the Company does not view the
     amount of equity used to support identifiable intangible assets and
     goodwill as available to support the Company's remaining net assets. Net
     leverage, as so defined, is used by many of the Company's creditors and a
     leading rating agency. These measures as presented by the Company are not
     necessarily comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other
     companies in the securities industry because of different methods of
     calculation.
(h)  At August 31, 2004, May 31, 2004 and February 29, 2004, long-term debt
     includes $1,000 million, $1,385 million and $1,310 million, respectively,
     of junior subordinated debt issued to trusts that prior to February 29,
     2004 was classified as preferred securities subject to mandatory
     redemption. On and after February 29, 2004 these amounts are classified as
     long-term debt pursuant to the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 46,
     Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities - an interpretation of ARB No.
     51 ("FIN 46"). See "Management's Discussion and Analysis--New Accounting
     Developments" and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the
     Company's 2003 Annual Report to Stockholders. The junior subordinated debt
     issued to trusts at August 31, 2004, May 31, 2004 and February 29, 2004 and
     the preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption at the prior
     period ends are collectively referred to hereinafter as junior subordinated
     debt.
(i)  On October 31, 2003, the Company acquired Neuberger Berman Inc. for a net
     purchase price of $2,788 million, including cash consideration and
     incidental costs of $690 million, equity consideration of $2,374 million
     and excluding net cash and short-term investments acquired of $276 million.
(j)  The Company believes total stockholders' equity plus junior subordinated
     debt to be a more meaningful measure of the Company's equity because the
     junior subordinated debt is subordinated and has a maturity at issuance of
     49 years and the Company can defer interest payments for up to 20
     consecutive quarters if the junior subordinated debt is not in default. In
     addition, a leading rating agency views these securities as equity capital
     for purposes of calculating net leverage. (See the reconciliation on page
     12.)
(k)  Tangible equity capital is defined as total stockholders' equity plus
     junior subordinated debt less identifiable intangible assets and goodwill.
     (See the reconciliation on page 12.) The Company believes tangible equity
     capital to be a more meaningful measure of the Company's equity for
     purposes of calculating net leverage because the Company does not view the
     amount of equity used to support identifiable intangible assets and
     goodwill as available to support the Company's remaining net assets.
(l)  Total capital includes long-term debt (including junior subordinated debt)
     and total stockholders' equity. The Company believes total capital is
     useful to investors as a measure of the Company's financial strength.
(m)  The book value per common share calculation includes amortized restricted
     stock units granted under stock award programs, which have been included in
     total stockholders' equity.
(n)  Gross leverage is defined as total assets divided by total stockholders'
     equity.
