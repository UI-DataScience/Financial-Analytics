Exhibit 99.1


Candie's Inc.  Reports Second Quarter Net Income of $518,000 Versus Loss of $3.8
Million in Prior Year

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 9, 2004--Candie's Inc. (NASDAQ: CAND):

    --  EPS $0.02 versus loss of $0.15 in prior year quarter

    --  Licensing SG&A expenses reduced from $6.4 million to $1.9 million.

Candie's Inc. (NASDAQ: CAND) (the "Company") today announced its results for the
second quarter and six months ended July 31, 2004 of its fiscal year ending
January 31, 2005. The Company reported consolidated net income of $518,000 for
the quarter or $0.02 per diluted share, as compared to a loss of $3.8 million or
$0.15 per diluted share for the prior year quarter. Licensing income for the
quarter increased to $2.1 million from $1.8 million in the prior year quarter
and SG&A expenses in the licensing segment decreased by 70.8 % from $6.4 million
to $1.9 million.

As previously announced, as of the end of Fiscal 2004, the Company completed the
transition of its wholesale and retail footwear business to the new licensing
model. The Company is in the process of transitioning its jeanswear operations
to TKO Apparel Licensing, Inc, which is the new licensee for BONGO(R) jeans and
which will also purchase the Company's wholly-owned jeanswear subsidiary,
Unzipped Apparel, LLC ("Unzipped") for a purchase price to be based on the
tangible net worth of Unzipped at the time of closing. The jeanswear license
will begin generating licensing income as of the third quarter of this fiscal
year. Chairman and CEO Neil Cole said "We are definitely moving in the right
direction. Looking ahead, the conversion of BONGO jeanswear to a license, along
with the CANDIE'S(R) footwear license, will generate additional royalties and
profits and eliminate jeanswear SG&A expenses. We are pleased with the
continuing popularity of our powerful BONGO and CANDIE'S brands and look forward
to increased income and profitability as we move into next year."

For the six months ended July 31, 2004 the Company reported consolidated net
income of $551,000 versus a loss of $3.0 million in the prior year six month
period. Licensing income increased over 30% to $4.0 million from $3.0 million in
the comparable prior year period and SG&A expenses in the licensing segment
decreased by 71.7% from $13.8 million to $3.9 million.

The six month results reflect an increase of $5.5 million in sales and cost of
sales in the first quarter ended April 30, 2004 from the Company's Bright Star
subsidiary to recognize, as gross sales, certain revenues previously recorded as
net sales. This change will be reported in an amended 10Q filing for the quarter
ended April 30, 2004. This reclassification does not affect the previously
reported gross profit, operating income, net income or earnings per share.

Shareholders are invited to listen to the conference call scheduled for today at
10:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time. The call will be webcast live via the Internet
and can be accessed by logging on to www.candiesinc.com and clicking on the
"Live Webcast" link on the "Investor's Overview" page. The call will be archived
on the web and a replay can also be accessed via telephone by dialing (888)
286-8010 and will be available through September 17, 2004.
