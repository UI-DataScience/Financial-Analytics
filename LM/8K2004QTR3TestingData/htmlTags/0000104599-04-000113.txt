</TABLE>

(a) Comparable store sales include  merchandise  sales from domestic stores that
have been open for 12 full  calendar  months and from all relocated  stores,  as
well as merchandise sales originated by circuitcity.com. Circuit City expects to
include  international  segment  sales in  consolidated  comparable  store sales
beginning with the second quarter of next fiscal year.


For the second quarter ended August 31, 2004,  total sales increased 8.9 percent
to  $2.35  billion  from  $2.16  billion  in the same  period  last  year,  with
comparable store merchandise  sales increasing 2.9 percent.  For the six months,
total sales  increased  7.9 percent to $4.41  billion from $4.09  billion in the
first  half of  last  fiscal  year,  with  comparable  store  merchandise  sales
increasing 4.5 percent.

"We believe  that the second  quarter  sales  results  reflect  improvements  in
store-level  execution and  congratulate our store operations team for its focus
on improving the shopping  experience for Circuit City  customers," said W. Alan
McCollough,  Circuit City's chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We
also continue to generate strong growth in Web-originated sales. We believe that
softer  sales in  August,  compared  with the first two  months of the  quarter,
reflect a generally  softer retail  climate in that month and the shift of Labor
Day weekend into September, or our third quarter, from August of last year." The
company  estimates  that the Labor Day  weekend  shift  reduced  second  quarter
comparable store sales by slightly more than one percentage point.

Sales by Merchandise  Category.  The percent of merchandise sales represented by
each major product category for the quarters and six-month  periods ended August
31, 2004 and 2003,  are shown below.  InterTAN sales have been included in sales
by merchandise  category since  completion of the acquisition in May, but had no
material impact on the percentages for the second quarter or six months.

</TABLE>

In the video  category,  Circuit City produced a single-digit  comparable  store
sales increase,  led by sales of new technology  televisions and digital imaging
products.  Video sales  reflect  triple-digit  comparable  store sales growth in
plasma  and  LCD  televisions  and  double-digit  growth  in  sales  of  digital
televisions  and  digital  imaging  products.   Double-digit  declines  in  tube
television  and DVD player sales and a single-digit  decline in camcorder  sales
partly offset the growth in other products.

Comparable  store  sales  in  the  audio  category  were  relatively  unchanged.
Double-digit comparable store sales growth in portable audio products, driven by
digital audio products such as MP3 players,  and  single-digit  growth in mobile
audio  products,   driven  by  satellite  radio,  were  offset  by  double-digit
comparable store sales declines in home audio products.

A single-digit  comparable  store sales increase in the  information  technology
category  reflects  single-digit  comparable store sales growth in both personal
computer hardware and accessories.  In personal computer hardware,  double-digit
comparable  store sales growth in notebooks  was partly  offset by  double-digit
declines in desktop  computers and  single-digit  declines in printers.  Monitor
sales were relatively unchanged from the prior year.

Comparable store sales in the entertainment  category were relatively  unchanged
reflecting a double-digit  decline in video game products offset by single-digit
comparable store sales growth in music software. Comparable store sales of video
software were relatively unchanged.

Domestic Segment
For the second  quarter,  total sales for the  domestic  segment  increased  3.4
percent to $2.23 billion from $2.16  billion in the same period last year,  with
comparable store  merchandise  sales  increasing 2.9 percent.  For the first six
months,  total sales for the  domestic  segment  increased  4.5 percent to $4.27
billion from $4.09 billion in the same period last year, with  comparable  store
merchandise sales increasing 4.5 percent.

Credit Revenues.  The domestic segment generates credit revenues from an ongoing
arrangement under which Chase Card Services offers  private-label and co-branded
credit cards to Circuit City customers.  The domestic  segment's credit revenues
from that arrangement amounted to $6.6 million in this year's second quarter and
are included in total sales. Prior to this year's second quarter,  private-label
and co-branded  credit cards were made available  through  Circuit City's wholly
owned  subsidiary,   First  North  American  National  Bank.  Private-label  and
co-branded  finance  income was reported as finance  income on the  consolidated
statements of operations  in all prior  periods and,  thus,  was not included in
total sales.

"We are pleased  with the early  results  from our  arrangement  with Chase Card
Services," said McCollough.  "The second quarter credit revenues were consistent
with our expectations for annual revenues under this relationship."

Store  Revitalization.  During the quarter,  the domestic segment  continued its
store  revitalization  program as it opened its sixth Circuit City Superstore in
the Richmond,  Va.,  market and its twelfth  Superstore  in the Houston,  Texas,
market and relocated a total of nine  Superstores.  The company  expects to open
another 18 Superstores,  relocate an additional 12 Superstores and fully remodel
one Superstore in the third quarter.

International Segment
Circuit City's total sales for the second quarter include  international segment
sales of $118.0  million;  total sales for the six months include  international
segment  sales of $139.7  million.  The  international  segment  consists of the
operations  of  InterTAN,  Inc.,  which  Circuit  City  acquired  in  May  2004.
International  segment  sales will not be included in the  company's  comparable
store sales until the second  quarter of next fiscal year. For the quarter ended
August 31, 2004,  InterTAN sales increased 17.1 percent,  from $100.7 million in
the same  period  last year and  InterTAN  comparable  store  merchandise  sales
increased 10.0 percent. For the six months ended August 31, 2004, InterTAN sales
increased  15.7  percent  from  $189.2  million in the same period last year and
InterTAN comparable store merchandise sales increased 7.0 percent. The effect of
fluctuations  in foreign  currency  exchange rates  accounted for  approximately
three  percentage  points of InterTAN's  second quarter total sales increase and
approximately five percentage points of the six-month increase. Comparable store
sales  declined 4.7 percent for the quarter ended August 31, 2003,  and declined
6.0 percent for the six months ended August 31, 2003.

Stock Buyback
During the second quarter,  Circuit City  repurchased  stock in the open market,
consistent with the board's $400 million authorization. Through August 31, 2004,
the company had repurchased and retired  approximately 20.3 million shares under
this authorization at a cost of $225.0 million.  Of this total,  repurchases and
retirements  during the second quarter totaled  approximately 5.3 million shares
at a cost of $69.6 million.
