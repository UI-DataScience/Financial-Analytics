                 Horizon Financial Services Corporation Reports
                Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year End 2004 Results,
           Announces Annual Meeting Date, And Increases Cash Dividend
                          For First Quarter Fiscal 2005

Oskaloosa, Iowa -- Horizon Financial Services Corporation, Nasdaq OTC BB (HZFS),
the parent  company of Horizon  Federal  Savings Bank,  reported net earnings of
$383,000 or $0.49 per share, fully diluted, for the quarter ended June 30, 2004,
compared to $314,000 or $0.41 per share,  fully  diluted,  for the quarter ended
June 30, 2003, a net  earnings  increase of 21.7%.  The increase in net earnings
for the quarter compared to the same quarter one year earlier is attributable to
several factors.  Net interest income improved by $138,000 from $962,000 for the
quarter ended June 30, 2003 to  $1,101,000  for the quarter ended June 30, 2004.
The  Company's  net interest  margin,  which is net interest  income  divided by
average  interest-earning  assets, was 4.72% for the quarter ended June 30, 2004
compared to 4.36% for the same period ended 2003. For the quarter ended June 30,
2004 there was an  increase  in  non-interest  expense  of $66,000 to  $692,000,
compared to $626,000 for the quarter  ended June 30, 2003,  primarily the result
of  increases  of  $22,000  in  office   property  and  equipment,   $14,000  in
advertising,   and  $108,000  in  compensation   and  benefits.   The  increased
compensation  expense is mainly a result of hiring and training  our  additional
staff for our new Pleasant Hill, Iowa,  office that will open in August of 2004,
but is enhanced  by  increased  employee  insurance  costs and a $35,500  credit
adjustment of pension  expense posted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Some
non-interest  expense  increases were offset by a substantial  decrease in other
expense of $68,000 primarily comprised of reduced employee education costs, loss
on disposal of fixed assets,  and a reduction in audit and accounting expense in
the quarter ended June 30, 2004. An overall  increase in non-interest  income of
$23,000,  comprised  primarily of an increase in fees,  commissions  and service
charges of $32,000,  contributed  to the increase in earnings for quarters being
compared.  Provisions for losses on loans  increased by $30,000 from $60,000 for
the quarter ended June 30, 2003 to $90,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2004.

The Company also reported  results for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.  The
Company  reported net earnings of $1,331,000 or $1.72 per share,  fully diluted,
for the  twelve  months  ended  June  30,  2004,  compared  to net  earnings  of
$1,139,000 or $1.48 per share,  fully diluted,  for the twelve months ended June
30,  2003,  an increase of 16.8%.  The increase in income for the fiscal year is
primarily  attributable  to increased  net  interest  income of $397,000 for the
fiscal year ended 2004 as compared to 2003 and increased  non-interest income of
$340,000,  as a result of a  $162,000  securities  impairment  loss on an equity
security  in the 2003  fiscal  year and a $155,000  increase in gains on sale of
securities  in 2004.  Fees,  commissions  and  service  charges  also  increased
$62,000.  Provision for loan losses  increased  $64,000 to $300,000 for the year
ended June 30,  2004  compared  to  $236,000  for the year ended June 30,  2003.
Non-interest  expense increased  $433,000 during the fiscal year to $2.9 million
from $2.4 million  mainly due to increased  compensation  expense of $261,000 as

the Company has added  employees  to open our new bank office in Pleasant  Hill,
Iowa. Office property and equipment  expense  increased  $113,000 for the fiscal
year ended 2004 over the prior year primarily attributable to increased property
taxes, depreciation, technology equipment maintenance, and office building rent.
Net interest  margin for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 was 4.61%  compared
to 4.31% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003. "I am very pleased that income
for the fiscal year remained very strong and sufficient to produce an annualized
12.15% return on equity," stated Robert W. DeCook, Chief Executive Officer.

At June 30, 2004,  Horizon  Financial  Services  Corporation had total assets of
$99.0 million and stockholders'  equity of $11.5 million, or $14.86 per share of
common stock  outstanding  compared to assets of $91.3 million and stockholders'
equity of $10.4 million or $13.95 per share at June 30, 2003.  Horizon Financial
Services Corporation and its subsidiary, Horizon Federal Savings Bank, provide a
wide range of  financial  products  and services  through  three  offices in two
counties in southeast Iowa. In addition, the Company will open a new bank office
in Pleasant Hill, Iowa, a suburb of Des Moines, near the end of August, 2004.

The annual  meeting  record date is September 3, 2004 and the annual  meeting of
shareholders  will be held  October  28,  2004,  at the home  office of  Horizon
Federal Savings Bank, 301 1st Avenue East, Oskaloosa, Iowa, at 3:00p.m.

Horizon Financial Services  Corporation also announced that the Corporation will
pay a cash  dividend  of 6.25  cents  per share  for the  first  quarter  ending
September  30,  2004.  The  dividend  will be payable on  September  10, 2004 to
shareholders  of record on September 3, 2004. The 6.25 cent cash dividend is one
quarter of a cent higher than the previous quarter.
