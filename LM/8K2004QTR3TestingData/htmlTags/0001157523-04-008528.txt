                   Somanetics Reports Record Net Revenues and
           Earnings Per Share of $0.05 for the Third Quarter of 2004

    TROY, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 15, 2004--Somanetics
Corporation (Nasdaq:SMTS):

    --  Net income increased to a record $539,722, or $0.05 per
        diluted share.

    --  Record net revenues of $3.1 million were led by a 44 percent
        increase in U.S. sales.

    --  Gross margins increased to 86 percent.

    Somanetics Corporation (Nasdaq:SMTS) reported record net revenues
of $3,076,373 for the third quarter ended August 31, 2004, a 34
percent increase from $2,303,880 in the same period of 2003. For the
nine months ended August 31, 2004, net revenues increased 36 percent
to $8,779,614 from $6,458,268.
    U.S. net revenues climbed 44 percent in the third quarter to
$2,600,458 from $1,808,485 in the same period of 2003. International
net revenues were $475,915 compared with $495,395 in the third quarter
of 2003. For the nine-month period, U.S. net revenues increased 40
percent to $7,390,347 and international net revenues increased 17
percent to $1,389,267.
    Somanetics reported record third quarter net income of $539,722,
or $0.05 per diluted share, compared with net income of $75,454, or
$0.01 per diluted share, in the same period of 2003. For the
nine-month period, Somanetics reported net income of $1,242,197, or
$0.11 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $249,368, or
$0.03 per diluted share, in the same period of 2003.
    Gross margins increased to 86 percent in the third quarter from 77
percent in the same period of 2003 and 83 percent in the second
quarter of 2004. For the nine-month period, gross margins were 83
percent, compared with 76 percent in the first nine months of 2003.
    At August 31, 2004, the Company's cash balance was $6.3 million.
For the nine-month period, net increase in cash was $4.1 million and
net cash provided by operations was $1.9 million.
    "A strong U.S. performance led to record net revenues and net
income for the quarter," said Bruce Barrett, Somanetics' president and
CEO. "International results this quarter reflected purchasing
seasonality by our distributors; the third quarter of 2003 featured
unusually high demand by Tyco Healthcare."

    Recent Highlights

    During the quarter, Somanetics completed its initiative to double
the size of the U.S. direct sales team, and the sales team was
supplemented with the addition of independent representatives in some
western markets.
    During the third quarter, Somanetics achieved an important
milestone when the South Korean government approved reimbursement for
use of the INVOS System. The next step is to work with government
officials to determine which patients will be covered and the level of
reimbursement.
    Somanetics and Fresenius Medical Care Extracorporeal Alliance
(Fresenius), a division of Fresenius Medical Care North America, plan
to formalize their business relationship. Fresenius provides the INVOS
technology to its cardiovascular perfusion customers. Fresenius'
clinical staff uses its expertise to demonstrate the benefits of the
INVOS System and to educate the cardiac surgery team and hospital
administrators about the importance of monitoring cerebral oxygen
levels during open heart surgery.
    "We are excited about this relationship because it is proving to
be an effective sales model in accounts where Fresenius provides
perfusion services," Barrett said.

    Outlook

    "As a result of our third quarter achievements, we are raising our
fiscal 2004 earnings per share guidance from $0.13 to $0.15 per
diluted common share to $0.15 to $0.17 per diluted common share,"
Barrett said. "We expect fourth quarter revenue will be in the range
of $3.5 to $4 million."
    During the fourth quarter, Somanetics will attend a number of
regional perfusion society meetings and the American Society of
Anesthesiologists' annual meeting, which is expected to feature more
than a dozen papers about the use of cerebral oximetry.
    In October, a manuscript by Scott Goldman, MD, chairman of the
department of surgery at Pennsylvania-based Lankenau Hospital, a
member of the Main Line Health hospital system, will be published in
the Heart Surgery Forum. The article reviews the results of a study
performed by Dr. Goldman that showed a statistically significant
reduction in permanent stroke among cardiac surgery patients monitored
with the INVOS Cerebral Oximeter.
    Dr. Goldman's manuscript follows a recent publication of Seminars
in Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia, which increased awareness
of cerebral oximetry through articles focused on the topic of
monitoring the nervous system during cardiac and vascular surgery.
    "Dr. Goldman's study is the first involving enough patients to
generate statistically significant results, including reductions in
permanent stroke, and the first to be published in manuscript form,"
said Barrett. "We hope this data will help persuade cardiac teams to
view cerebral oximetry as an important ingredient of an overall stroke
mitigation strategy."

    About Somanetics

    Somanetics develops and markets two medical devices that offer
solutions to help meet critical medical needs. The INVOS(R) Cerebral
Oximeter holds a unique position in U.S. hospitals as the only
noninvasive and continuous monitor of changes in regional brain blood
oxygen saturation that is commercially available. The INVOS Cerebral
Oximeter guides the surgical team to identify regional brain blood
oxygen imbalances and help take corrective action to prevent
neurological injuries related to surgery and reduce the cost of care.
The CorRestore(R) System is a cardiac implant for use in cardiac
repair and reconstruction, including an operation called Surgical
Ventricular Restoration, SVR, a treatment for patients with certain
types of severe congestive heart failure. Somanetics' web site is
