             DYNATRONICS ANNOUNCES RECORD-BREAKING YEAR-END RESULTS
             ------------------------------------------------------

         Salt Lake City, Utah (August 26, 2004) - Dynatronics Corporation
(NASDAQ: DYNT) today announced record results for its fiscal year ended June 30,
2004. Sales for the year jumped 22 percent to a new company high of $20.6
million, compared to $16.9 million in fiscal 2003. Net income for the year ended
June 30, 2004 also reached an all-time record of $970,272 ($.11 per share),
compared to $24,799 ($.00 per share) in fiscal 2003.

         Sales for the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2004, increased 29 percent
to $5.0 million, compared to $3.9 million for the same period in 2003. Net
income for the quarter rose to $245,213 ($.03 per share), compared to a net
fourth quarter loss in 2003 of $156,226 ($.02 per share).

         "Fiscal 2004 was a banner year for Dynatronics," stated Kelvyn H.
Cullimore Jr., company president. "The strong results reflect the popularity of
our new Solaris products that use advanced technology light therapy to relieve
pain."

         In June 2004, Dynatronics introduced a fifth unit to the Solaris family
- - the Solaris 701 - which combines ultrasound therapy with light therapy in a
single device. The company now provides one of the most complete lines of light
therapy products in the United States.

         "Light therapy is a proven winner," remarked Larry K. Beardall,
Dynatronics' executive vice president of marketing and sales. "With hundreds of
clinical research studies supporting its efficacy, light therapy is becoming an
important tool for medical practitioners. Thousands of people around the country
are already benefiting from this technology."

         Another important development was the June 2004 FDA clearance of
Dynatronics' newest light probe: the Dynatron 890. This probe, which began
shipping to customers last week, uses a laser diode that produces greater output
than the superluminous diodes in the current Dynatron 880.

         The success of this fiscal year is attributable to strategic research
and development initiatives begun over two years ago. Those initiatives continue
to be a cornerstone of Dynatronics' growth strategy, with several new products,
including additional light probes, slated for development and introduction in
fiscal 2005. These new product introductions are expected to spur organic growth
and help the company maintain its position as an innovative leader in the
industry.

         "With the success of this past year, we plan to continue our strategic
research and development focus in order to bring new products to the market in
coming years. It is this cycle of new product introductions that will provide
both top and bottom line growth in the future," added Cullimore.

         Dynatronics has scheduled a conference call for investors today at 1
p.m. EDT (11 a.m. MDT). Those wishing to participate should call 800-861-4084
and use passcode 9921511#.
