     o   FISCAL 2005 ORGANIC EARNINGS GROWTH A SOLID 9% - 13%


         ST. LOUIS, MO. - AUGUST 31, 2004 - ENGINEERED SUPPORT SYSTEMS, INC.
(Nasdaq: EASI) reported record third quarter net income from continuing
operations of $20.5 million, or $.73 per diluted share, for the period ended
July 31, 2004, compared to $12.4 million, or $.48 per diluted share, for the
same period last year. Excluding an after-tax charge of $0.8 million (or
$.03 per diluted share) related to losses realized on the sale of idled
manufacturing facilities, net earnings from continuing operations for the
quarter totaled $21.3 million, or $.76 per diluted share. Net revenues for
the quarter advanced 43% to a record $222.0 million on the strength of
recent acquisitions and exceptional organic growth, according to GERALD A.
POTTHOFF, VICE CHAIRMAN, CEO AND PRESIDENT.

Third quarter operating income from continuing operations of a record $34.7
million was 66% above the $20.9 million for the same quarter in the prior
year. As a percentage of net revenues, operating income from continuing
operations was 15.6% for the current quarter as compared to 13.4% for the
third quarter of fiscal 2003. Earnings before interest, income taxes,
depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) from continuing operations for the
current quarter totaled $37.5 million, or 16.9% of net revenues, compared to
$23.2 million in the prior year.

Quarterly net revenues increased primarily due to outstanding organic
revenue growth combined with the inclusion of the results of the Company's
most recent acquisitions -- Engineered Environments, Inc. (EEi) and Pivotal
Power Inc. (Pivotal Power), each acquired within the past twelve months. EEi
and Pivotal generated combined net revenues of $5.5 million during the third
quarter of 2004. Excluding the impact of these two acquisitions, net
revenues increased an impressive $60.8 million, or 39%, quarter over
quarter.



                                     2


Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter climbed 65% to a
record $20.5 million (9.2% of net revenues) compared to $12.4 million (8.0%
of net revenues) last year. The benefit of recent acquisitions as noted
above, combined with incremental profit contributions from existing business
units in each of the Company's business segments, led to the significant
advancement in reported results for the quarter.

For the first nine months of 2004, net income from continuing operations
totaled $54.6 million, or $1.96 per diluted share, compared to $29.3
million, or $1.15 per diluted share in 2003. Net revenues for the first nine
months of 2004 were $627.3 million compared to $402.4 million for the same
period in the prior year, a year-over-year increase of 56%.

Potthoff commented, "We just posted the most successful quarterly results in
the Company's history and are poised to finish up 2004 on a high note.
Organic revenue growth has been outstanding in all areas of the Company,
partly related to business opportunities emerging from ongoing U.S. military
operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, but, as importantly, many as a result of
the wide range of capabilities that we can now offer the military and
intelligence communities. The breadth of our capabilities represents the
backbone of our business and will serve our customers, employees and
shareholders well over the long haul."

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

For the third quarter, the Support Systems segment reported net revenues of
$134.9 million compared to $92.1 million (prior to the elimination of
inter-segment revenues in each period) for the same period in the prior
year, a 46% increase. The improved results reflect the inclusion of net
revenues from EEi and Pivotal Power during the third quarter coupled with
overall higher revenues at existing business units. Net organic revenue
growth for the Support Systems segment during the current quarter totaled
$37.3 million, an impressive 41%. The programs with the largest revenue
gains during the quarter included the Manportable Surveillance and Target
Acquisition Radar (MSTAR), which is serving a wide range of defense
applications including base perimeter security, M1000 Heavy Equipment
Transporters which are being refurbished after their recent battlefield
deployment, as well as a variety of other military support equipment.

Quarterly operating income for the Support Systems segment climbed to $25.6
million (19.0% of segment revenues) compared to $12.8 million last year.
Incremental revenues and related gross profit contributions, cost savings
realized under the Company's facility rationalization initiatives and the
absorption of corporate overhead costs by the fast-growing Support Services
business segment led to the improved results for the Support Systems
segment.

Net revenues of the Support Services segment climbed to $96.1 million
compared to $65.6 million (prior to the elimination of inter-segment
revenues in each period) for the third quarter of 2003, due to the emergence
of significant internal growth opportunities in several business areas. In
particular, satellite telecommunications support for deployed forces
remained robust, several security system integration projects were ongoing
and work on vehicle uparmor kits commenced during the third quarter.

Quarterly operating income for the Support Services segment rose to $9.1
million (9.5% of segment revenues) compared to $8.1 million last year. As
expected, the segment's operating margin for the



                                     3


current period improved significantly from that reported for the preceding
quarter of 2004 (1.9% of segment revenues for the second quarter). This
reflects a more favorable contract mix in the current quarter, in particular
a greater amount of production work on the Deployable Power Generation and
Distribution System (DPDGS) program as well as the ramp up of the
fabrication of vehicle uparmor kits. (The Support Services segment results
for the second quarter of 2004 also included non-cash amortization charges
totaling $2.2 million for customer-related intangible assets as a result of
the final valuation of the TAMSCO business which was completed during that
period.)

ENTERED ORDERS AND BACKLOG

Third quarter entered orders were $203 million bringing total entered orders
for the year to $748 million compared to $455 million at the same time last
year. The Company's trailing twelve month book-to-bill ratio currently sits
at 1.22 to 1. Strong order flow is expected for the remainder of the year to
achieve a 2004 entered orders target of $900 million supporting another
record year in 2005. At July 31, 2004, total contract backlog, including
unfunded options on existing contracts, was $1.3 billion. It should be noted
that the majority of the Company's multi-year services-related contracts are
not reflected in its reported unfunded backlog amounts.

REAFFRMED 2004 FORECAST; OUTLOOK FOR 2005

As stated in its press release dated August 20, 2004, the Company continues
to expect net revenues of approximately $840 million for 2004 generating
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.65 to $2.70 for
the year. This net earnings figure excludes any realized losses from the
sale of idled facilities as noted above. It does include the after-tax
impact of $3.1 million of non-recurring severance and related benefit costs
incurred and recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004. Of this amount,
approximately $2.6 million, or $.09 per diluted share, represents a non-cash
charge associated with the extension of the exercise period of vested
non-qualified stock options. The recording of this non-cash charge is
consistent with the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 44, "Accounting
for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation" (FIN 44), but in no
way changes the economic substance of the Company's existing financial
obligations.

Based upon its initial forecasts for 2005, Engineered Support expects net
revenues of between $910 million and $920 million - organic growth 8% to 10%
above 2004 levels -- yielding diluted earnings per share from continuing
operations of $2.95 to $3.00 - an increase of 9% to 13% compared to 2004.
These forecasted results exclude any financial impact related to potential
acquisitions, several of which the Company is actively pursuing.

"Clearly, 2004 has been an outstanding year of business growth for
Engineered Support. The impact of acquisitions, accelerated contract
deliveries and heightened customer demand have all combined to drive our
financials to record levels. Armed with our solid market positioning and
extensive capabilities to support an evolving military force waging a Global
War on Terror, our Company's central vision statement `The Military Doesn't
Leave Home Without Us' has never rang more true. As prospects emerge for the
prolonged involvement of U.S. and allied forces in unstable regions around
the globe, including the current areas of conflict, we continue to see a
robust market for the types of sustainment products and logistics services
that we offer. Along these lines, we are currently pursuing several
significant, multi-year new business opportunities in a wide range of


                                     4


applications. We look forward to discussing many of these opportunities more
fully during our conference call later this morning," concluded Potthoff.

In conjunction with this release, Engineered Support Systems will host a
conference call, which will be simulcast over the Internet. Michael F.
Shanahan, Sr., Chairman, Gerald A. Potthoff, Vice Chairman, CEO and
President, and Gary C. Gerhardt, Vice Chairman and CFO, will host the call,
