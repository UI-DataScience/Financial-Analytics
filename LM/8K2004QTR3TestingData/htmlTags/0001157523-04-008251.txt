Esterline 3Q EPS $.33 from Continuing OPS; Earnings $7.0 Million on
$150.6 Million Sales

    BELLEVUE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 2, 2004--Esterline
Corporation (NYSE:ESL) (www.esterline.com), a leading specialty
manufacturer serving aerospace/defense markets, today reported fiscal
2004 third quarter (ended July 30) income from continuing operations
of $7.0 million, or $.33 per diluted share, on $150.6 million sales.
Comparable earnings a year ago were $8.4 million, or $.40 per diluted
share, including a foreign currency gain of approximately $2.0 million
net of tax, or $.09 per share, on sales of $140.5 million.
    Robert W. Cremin, Esterline CEO said that he continues to be
encouraged by steady improvements in commercial aerospace markets.
"Increases in the world airlines' scheduled available seat miles,
departures, and flight hours are having a positive impact on our
business," Cremin said.
    Esterline's defense business also remains solid. Revenue activity
in the company's combustibles and countermeasure operations was
particularly strong; however, Cremin advised that the product mix was
skewed toward lower margin components.
    Cremin further indicated that expenses and production
inefficiencies associated with acquisition integration activity also
impacted the quarter.  He noted that, "...in connection with a
previous acquisition, we closed two plants in our Avionics & Controls
segment during the quarter, and moved the operations into a single new
facility. The new plant will enhance operating efficiencies going
forward, but due to zoning and other similar regulatory issues, the
move took longer and proved more disruptive than first anticipated."
    Responding to the practicality of offsetting these third quarter
events by fiscal year end, Cremin said the company is reducing its
full-year guidance to the range of $1.40 to $1.50 from its previous
guidance of $1.50 to $1.60. Cremin emphasized, though, that
fundamentally nothing has changed. "These kinds of timing issues have
their way of smoothing themselves out in a few quarters," he said.
"Our solid backlog and order book are good indicators that longer term
we remain firmly on track. Orders received in the third quarter
totaled $151.9 million compared with $147.4 million a year ago.
Year-to-date orders are up 5% to $463.7 million from $441.5 million a
year ago. Backlog at July 30, 2004, was $331.1 million compared with
$321.2 million at the end of the prior year period, and $329.9 million
at the end of last quarter.
    Year-to-date income from continuing operations was $18.1 million,
or $.84 per diluted share, on sales of $433.4 million. The results
include a previously reported first quarter $1.9 million tax benefit
and a $2.9 million after-tax severance expense. For the first nine
months of fiscal 2003, income from continuing operations was $20.3
million, or $.97 per share, including the previously noted $.09 per
share foreign currency gain, on sales of $402.1 million.
    The company also reported $0.6 million in net income, or $.03 per
diluted share, in the third quarter from a discontinued operation, W.
A. Whitney. In July 2002, Esterline discontinued its Automation
segment to focus on its core aerospace/defense business. On Tuesday,
August 31, Esterline signed a definitive agreement for the sale of the
Whitney operation. An after-tax gain of approximately $6 million is
expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter.
    Including discontinued operations, the company reported net
earnings in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 of $7.6 million, or $.36
per diluted share, compared with $8.4 million, or $.40 per diluted
share, in the prior year period. Year-to-date net earnings were $19.4
million, or $.90 per diluted share, compared with $14.5 million, or
$.69 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. The year-ago period
included a loss from discontinued operations of $5.8 million, or
($.28) per diluted share and the previously noted foreign currency
gain.
    Subsequent to the quarter close, Esterline finalized the
acquisition of Leach Holding Corporation for approximately $145
million in cash. Leach is a leading producer of high-performance
electromechanical relays, solid-state switching devices and advanced
power distribution assemblies primarily for aerospace applications.
The transaction brings more than 1,000 new employees to Esterline and
is expected to add nearly $120 million to Esterline's current
annualized revenue base of $600 million. Cremin noted that,
"...following a reasonable period of integration, the Leach business
is expected to contribute significant positive results."
