                                TO PROFITABILITY

               -    LOWER PRODUCTION COSTS AND EXPENSES OFFSET LOWER SALES
                    IN FISCAL 2004.

               -    DEBT IS REDUCED 64 PERCENT IN 2004.

ST. LOUIS, August 26, 2004 ---- Allied Healthcare Products, Inc. (NASDAQ: AHPI)
reported today that it earned a net income of $860,000, or 10 cents per diluted
share, during its fourth quarter ended June 30, 2004, compared to a loss of
$106,000, or a negative 1 cent per diluted share, for the quarter ended June 30,
2003.

         Sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 totaled $15.3 million
versus $14.3 million for the fourth quarter of the previous year, an increase of
7.0 percent. Gross Profit, as a percentage of sales, improved to 30.3% in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, from 22.6% in the fourth quarter of 2003.
Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2004 were lower by 6.6 percent than
they were in the fourth quarter of 2003.

         For the 2004 fiscal year ending June 30, 2004, Allied returned to
profitability despite sales that declined about 3 percent or $1.7 million from
the previous year.

         Allied earned a net income of $1.9 million, or 23 cents per diluted
share, for the 2004 fiscal year compared with a loss of $158,000, or negative 2
cents per diluted share, for fiscal 2003.

         Lower production costs and operating expenses in 2004 more than offset
the year's sales decline. Allied cut production costs with a number of
automation projects and increased in-house production of parts. Operating
expenses were reduced about $ 0.8 million for 2004, primarily through staff
reductions.

         Debt was reduced $6.4 million during fiscal 2004, from $10 million to
$3.6 million.

         "Throughout fiscal 2004, strong operating results and inventory
management helped us increase cash flow, improve margins and strengthen our
balance sheet," said Earl R. Refsland, president and chief executive officer.
"Sluggish sales have held us back, so building sales remains our top priority."

          Allied Healthcare Products, Inc. is a leading manufacturer of
respiratory care products, medical gas equipment and emergency medical products
used in a wide range of hospital and alternate care settings.
