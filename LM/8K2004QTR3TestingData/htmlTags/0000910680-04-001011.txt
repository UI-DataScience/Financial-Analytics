                     SILVERSTAR HOLDINGS REPORTS RESULTS FOR
                            YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2004

                 PROFIT OF $0.12 PER SHARE VERSUS $0.01 IN 2003
                    REFLECTS IMPROVEMENT IN OPERATING RESULTS

BOCA RATON,  FL- September 23, 2004 - Silverstar  Holdings,  Ltd.  (Nasdaq:SSTR)
today  reported net income of $0.12 per share for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2004.

The Company  generated  revenues of  $2,367,463  for the year with net income of
$1,002,523  or $0.12 per share.  Included  in net income was a non-cash  foreign
currency gain related to its South African assets of $1,287,291. Interest income
for the year was $603,352.

For fiscal 2003,  the Company earned net income of $69,348 or $0.01 per share on
revenues of  $3,141,448.  Included in net income was a foreign  currency gain of
$1,763,115. Interest income for the year was $638,011.

Clive Kabatznik,  Chief Executive Officer of Silverstar Holdings, said: "The net
income  for  fiscal  2004  reflects  not only the  increase  in the value of our
remaining South African assets,  but also reflects a return to profitability for
our operating subsidiary, Fantasy Sports, Inc."

"During  fiscal  2004,  we  focused on  operational  profitability  through  the
reduction of expenses and the  jettisoning of  unprofitable  revenue lines. As a
result,  Fantasy  Sports  achieved  profitability  for the fiscal  year,  and we
anticipate this subsidiary to generate improved  operating profits over the next
twelve months."

"Magnolia  Broadband  continues to make excellent progress towards producing and
selling  innovative  wireless  chip  sets  for the  mobile  cell  phone  market.
Magnolia's proposed product offerings have generated extremely positive industry
feedback,  as well as financial backing from major venture  capitalists.  We are
optimistic that this investment will generate value for Silverstar in the medium
term. "

Mr.  Kabatznik  concluded,  "Over the past year,  we have  evaluated a number of
strategic options to enhance  shareholder value. We continue to seek appropriate
opportunities  to enhance our revenues and income,  both organically and through
acquisitions."
