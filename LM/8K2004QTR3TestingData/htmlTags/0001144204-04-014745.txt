                      21ST CENTURY HOLDING COMPANY REPORTS
                            LOSSES FOR HURRICANE IVAN
                              AND FORWARD GUIDANCE

         PLANTATION, FLORIDA, SEPTEMBER 17, 2004 - EDWARD J. (TED) LAWSON,
PRESIDENT & CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF 21ST CENTURY HOLDING COMPANY (NASDAQ:
TCHC), comments about Federated National Insurance Company, a subsidiary of 21st
Century, "First and foremost we would like to assure all of our policyholders
that were effected by Hurricane Frances that our adjusters are in the stricken
area and working hard to help take care of them. Our claim lines are open 24
hours a day, 7 days a week. Our offices are staffed and we are responding to our
policyholders needs."

         Mr. Lawson continued, "Even though we've had damage from Hurricane
Ivan, because of our limited exposure in the panhandle our modeling now suggests
it will be manageable. At this time we are not changing our 2004 earnings per
share guidance of $0.50 to $1.50 per share or our 2005 guidance of approximately
$4.00 per share. Now after 3 major hurricanes, one of them, Frances, so large it
affected the entire state, and the other two, catastrophic category 4 storms,
we're still going to be strong and profitable. Even though the results are
tentative at this time, I personally think that's pretty impressive. Again, this
year's story is about hurricanes, but next year will be about growth and
profitability. "

         Safe harbor statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995: Statements in this press release that are not historical fact are
forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those
discussed herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, words such
as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "intend," "could," "would,"
"estimate," or "continue" or the other negative variations thereof or comparable
terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The risks and
uncertainties include, without limitation, uncertainties related to estimates,
assumptions and projections generally; inflation and other changes in economic
conditions (including changes in interest rates and financial markets); pricing
competition and other initiatives by competitors; ability to obtain regulatory
approval for applications to underwrite in an additional jurisdiction or for
requested rate changes, and the timing thereof; legislative and regulatory
developments; the outcome of litigation pending against the Company and any
settlement thereof; risks related to the nature of the Company's business;
dependence on investment income and the composition of the Company's investment
portfolio; the adequacy of the Company's liability for loss and loss adjustment
expense; insurance agents; claims experience; limited experience in the
insurance industry; ratings by industry services; catastrophe losses; reliance
on key personnel; weather conditions (including the severity and frequency of
storms, hurricanes, tornadoes and hail); changes in driving patterns and loss
trends; acts of war and terrorist activities; court decisions and trends in
litigation, and health care and auto repair costs; and other matters described
from time to time by the Company in releases and publications, and in periodic
reports and other documents filed with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission. In addition, investors should be aware that generally accepted
accounting principles prescribe when a company may reserve for particular risks,
including litigation exposures. Accordingly, results for a given reporting
period could be significantly affected if and when a reserve is established for
a major contingency. Reported results may therefore appear to be volatile in
certain accounting periods.
