<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3><B>PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS, INC. ANNOUNCES<BR>
FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 3, 2004</B></FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=3>Edison, NJ- AUGUST 23, 2004
- - PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS, INC. (OTC Bulletin Board: PHFR) (&#147;PFI&#148;
or the &#147;Company&#148;) announced today that it had consolidated net sales
of $36.2 million for the six months ended July 3, 2004 compared with
consolidated net sales of $33.8 million for the comparable period of the prior
year, an increase of 7.3%. The increase is primarily due to the inclusion of the
net sales of Konsyl Pharmaceuticals Inc., which was acquired by PFI on May 15,
2003. Konsyl&#146;s net sales were $5.3 million in the current six-month period
as compared to $1.3 million in the prior period. Net sales for PFI without
Konsyl decreased $1.5 million or 4.7% to $31.0 million from the prior year. This
decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower prices and increased price
competition in the Private Label Over-the-Counter market, decreased production
for certain contract manufacturing customers, and higher sales discounts and
allowances. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales on a consolidated
basis was 86.1% for the six months ended July 3, 2004 as compared to 84.3% in
the prior period. Konsyl&#146;s cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was
51.8% for the current period. PFI&#146;s cost of sales (excluding Konsyl) as a
percentage of net sales increased to 92.0% for the current period from 85.2% for
the comparable period in the prior fiscal year due to increased competition in
the Over-the-Counter market, decreased production from certain contract
manufacturing customers, increased sales discounts and allowances due to higher
retailer rebate programs and chargebacks from our private label customers and a
shift in product mix in both the Private Label and Contract Manufacturing
businesses to lower margin products. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Selling, general and administrative expenses were $7.7 million
or 21.2% of net sales for the six months ended July 3, 2004 as compared to $5.3
million or 15.7% of net sales in the prior year period. The increase of $2.4
million is primarily due to Konsyl&#146;s results being included as of May 16,
2003. The remaining increase reflects higher distribution expenses, professional
fees, insurance expenses and personnel expenses. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Company incurred a net loss of $2.8 million or $.03 per
share for the six months ended July 3, 2004 as compared to a net loss of
$915,000 or $.01 per share in the prior period. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The Company continues to strengthen it management team with the
appointment of Brian Bradley to the new position of Executive Vice President of
Sales &amp; Marketing for PFI effective August 2, 2004. Mr. Bradley will be
responsible for the entire Sales &amp; Marketing areas. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>Mr. Bradley brings over 20 years of sales, marketing
and management experience to PFI. Most recently he was President &amp; Chief
Executive Officer of USA Labs, an upscale manufacturer of personal care and
household consumer products. From 1995 to 2003, Brian advanced from Vice
President of Sales to President and Chief Customer Officer at Lander Co., Inc.,
a premier custom health &amp; beauty care manufacturing company. Prior to that, he
served two years as Sales Director at Schering Plough and eight years in field
sales at Wyeth Pharmaceuticals.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&#147;Brian&#146;s experience spans the National Brand, Private
Label, Value Brand and Exclusive Brand segments in the OTC and HBC products
categories. His profound understanding of the challenges and opportunities
within the OTC markets will be of immediate value in PFI realizing our
objectives and strategic goals&#148; said Michael A. Zeher, President and Chief
Operating Officer of PFI. &#147;His strong relationships in the trade will
significantly improve PFI&#146;s position with major customers&#148; continued
Zeher. </FONT></P>
