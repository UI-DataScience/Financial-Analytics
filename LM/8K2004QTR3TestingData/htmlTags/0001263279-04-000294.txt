For Immediate Release


                     DELTA PETROLEUM CORPORATION ANNOUNCES
       300% INCREASE IN FY2004 NET INCOME ON REVENUE OF $36.4 MILLION

                   EBITDAX INCREASES 128% TO $21.6 MILLION

     DENVER, Colorado (September 13, 2004) -- Delta Petroleum Corporation
(NASDAQ: DPTR); (FRANKFURT STOCK EXCHANGE: DPE), an independent energy
exploration and development company, today reported its operating results for
the quarter and fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.

     For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004, total revenue from continuing
operations increased 76% to $36.4 million, compared with $20.7 million in the
previous fiscal year.  Net income rose 302% to $5 million, or $0.17 per
diluted share, versus net income of $1.3 million, or $0.05 per diluted share,
in FY2003.  EBITDAX (see reconciliation table at the end of this release)
increased 128%  to $21.6 million in FY2004, compared with $9.5 million in the
previous fiscal year.

     The increases in revenue and net income were primarily due to a 40%
increase in production and somewhat higher oil and natural gas prices.
Production from continuing operations in FY2004 reached 7.23 Bcfe (billion
cubic feet equivalent).  This compared with total production from continuing
operations of 5.16 Bcfe for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003.  Production
increases reflect acquisitions and drilling development activities but do not
include any significant contribution from properties that were acquired in the
Alpine Resources transaction which closed on June 29, 2004.

     The average price realized for oil in FY2004 approximated $33.09 per
barrel (Bbl) onshore and $22.11 per Bbl offshore, compared with $28.82 per Bbl
onshore and $20.21 per Bbl offshore in the previous fiscal year.  The average
price realized for natural gas approximated $5.27 per thousand cubic feet
(Mcf) in FY2004, versus $4.71 per Mcf in FY2003.  The Company recognized a
modest loss on hedging activities that averaged $0.14 per Mcf equivalent in
FY2004.

     "We are very pleased to report record results in virtually every category
of our operations   revenue, income from continuing operations, net income and
EBITDAX -- for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004," commented Roger A.
Parker, President and Chief Executive Officer of Delta Petroleum Corporation.
"These results did not include any significant production and revenue
contributions from the Alpine Resources acquisition that occurred a few days
prior to the end of our fiscal year.  This acquisition should have a very
meaningful impact upon our Fiscal 2005 operating results."

     "Whereas the 83% increase in our proved reserves during Fiscal 2004 was
primarily due to acquisitions, a significant increase in drilling activities
since the end of the fiscal year should contribute substantially to production
and reserve increases in the current fiscal year," continued Parker.  "Our
most active drilling programs are located in Washington County, Colorado,
Fremont County, Wyoming; and will begin soon on a number of the properties
acquired from Alpine Resources in Texas."

     For the three months ended June 30, 2004, total revenue from continuing
operations increased 132% to $11.6 million, versus $5 million in the fourth
quarter of the previous fiscal year.  Net income rose to $586,000, versus a
net loss of $595,000 in FY2003.

                Total Reserves as of June 30, 2004 and Drilling
                     Activity Subsequent to June 30, 2004

     In its Form 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Delta will report total proved reserves of 168 Bcfe as of June 30, 2004, which
represented an 83% increase when compared with 92 Bcfe as of June 30, 2003.
The increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed during the most
recent fiscal year.  Drilling activity did not substantially impact proved
reserves, because most of the capital expenditures related to drilling did not
occur until late in the fiscal year.

     A significant increase in drilling activity since the end of FY2004 has
begun to produce results.  To date, the Company has drilled or recompleted 12
Niobrara formation wells and 3 "D" sand gas wells in Washington County,
Colorado, and management estimates that the new wells have added 6 Bcfe in
proved reserves since June 30, 2004.  The Company is currently drilling
approximately 12 wells per month on these properties.  We have also drilled
two successful wells on our Willow Creek Unit in the Piceance Basin in Western
Colorado and recently began drilling a 15,500' test well on our Howard Ranch
properties in the Wind River Basin in Wyoming.  In addition, drilling
development is continuing in our Deerlick Creek Field in the Black Warrior
Basin in Alabama.

     Delta Petroleum Corporation is an oil and gas exploration and development
Company based in Denver, Colorado. The Company has producing properties in 15
states and interests in one producing federal unit and four undeveloped units
located in federal waters offshore California near Santa Barbara. Its common
stock is traded on NASDAQ under the symbol "DPTR" and on the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange under the symbol "DPE."

safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995.  Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve
risks and uncertainty, including without limitation, the costs of exploring

exploration costs and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.
This reconciliation is provided in accordance with applicable rules adopted by
the Securities and Exchange Commission.  "EBITDAX" is not a measure of
performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America and should not be considered in isolation or construed as a
substitute for net income or other operations data or cash flow data prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States for purposes of analyzing our profitability or liquidity.  In addition,
not all funds depicted by "EBITDAX" are available for management's
discretionary use but are subject to contractual restrictions and functional
requirements to pay debt service, fund necessary capital expenditures and meet
other commitments as described in more detail in the Company's Form 10-K for
the year ended June 30, 2004 as filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.  "EBITDAX" as calculated above may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures reported by other companies.
