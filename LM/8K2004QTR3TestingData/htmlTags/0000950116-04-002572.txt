     TOLL BROTHERS' RECORD 3RD QTR 2004 NET INCOME UP 56% TO $106.0 MILLION
               RECORD 3RD QTR EPS INCREASES 46% TO $1.31 PER SHARE
                RECORD 3RD QTR REVENUES GROW 46% TO $1.0 BILLION
                RECORD 3RD QTR CONTRACTS RISE 69% TO $1.6 BILLION
              RECORD 3RD QTR-END BACKLOG IS UP 75% TO $4.3 BILLION


Huntingdon Valley, PA, August 25, 2004 -- Toll Brothers, Inc., (NYSE:TOL)
(www.tollbrothers.com), the nation's leading builder of luxury homes, today
reported that its third quarter ended July 31, 2004 was the best quarter in its
history for net income, earnings per share, revenues, contracts and backlog. In
addition, unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company had an interest
signed contracts of $79.1 million in the third quarter of FY 2004.

Robert I. Toll, chairman and chief executive officer, stated: "Buyer appetite
for new luxury homes has remained tremendous throughout 2004 and we are enjoying
very strong demand across all our product lines. Therefore, we believe that FY
2004 will be our twelfth consecutive year of record earnings.

"Based on our current backlog, which affords revenue visibility over the next
nine to twelve months, and the pace of current demand, we project FY 2005
deliveries of between 7,700 and 8,000 homes with an average delivered price in
excess of $600,000. Therefore, we believe we'll achieve at least 30% net income
growth (25% earnings per share growth) in FY 2005. Based on our projections of
community growth in the coming year, assuming continuing strong demand, we
believe that 20% revenue and net income growth should be achievable in FY 2006.

"We continue to demonstrate our ability to grow dramatically in a very difficult
economy: Since 2000, despite an economic recession, dramatic job losses, a
severe stock market slump, and global political turmoil, we have doubled our
revenues and net income. While much of this can be attributed to the tremendous
hard work of our associates, we also believe it reflects the strength of the
luxury market, the brand name we have built, the growing number of affluent U.S.
households and the industry's environment of greater stability and reduced
cyclicality.

"Geographic and product diversification, access to lower-cost capital, a
versatile and abundant home mortgage market and improving demographics are
promoting strong and steady demand across many price points for those builders
who can control land and persevere through the increasingly difficult regulatory
approval process. This evolution in our industry favors the large, publicly
traded home building companies with the capital and expertise to control sites
and gain market share. This helps explain the growth of many of the public home
building companies during these difficult economic times.

                                     *more*
<PAGE>
"Two recent studies, one from Harvard University and the other from the
Homeownership Alliance, project that demand for new housing should range from
1.85 million up to 2.17 million new single and multi-family units annually over
the next ten years. Yet our industry's average annual production peaked in the
1970's at 1.77 million units and has never reached that sustained pace again
because of increasing regulatory land approval constraints that restrict supply.
In this environment, we envision a growing shortage of home sites as demand
increases. In anticipation, we now control more than 61,000 home sites in
affluent lot constrained urban and suburban markets. With this supply, we
believe we are well positioned for continued growth in the coming years."

Toll Brothers' financial highlights for the period ended July 31, 2004
