     American Greetings Announces Improved Results and Initiates Dividend

     - Company reports second quarter EPS of 10 cents versus net loss of
       15 cents in prior period

     - Licensing income remains strong

     - Forecast for cash flow increased for the year by 25% to $250 million

     - Company initiates quarterly cash dividend of 6 cents per share

    CLEVELAND, Sept. 29 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- American Greetings
Corporation (NYSE: AM) today announced its financial results for the second
fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2004. Despite flat net sales in the second
quarter, the Corporation exceeded its prior year earnings per share results
due primarily to increased licensing income, reduced supply chain costs and
lower interest expense.  The Corporation's Board of Directors authorized the
initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of 6 cents per share.

    Second Quarter
    As a result of the letter of agreement announced on July 30th to sell the
Magnivision subsidiary, the Corporation has classified its Magnivision
subsidiary as a discontinued operation.   The Corporation has provided
financial results on continuing operations as well as net results of
discontinued operations (the assets held for sale). The Corporation reported
net income from continuing operations of $5.9 million, or 9 cents per share,
on net sales of $391.9 million, for the fiscal 2005 second quarter ended
August 31, 2004 (all per-share amounts assume dilution). This compares to a
reported net loss from continuing operations of $10.6 million, or 16 cents per
share, on net sales of $390.9 million, for the year earlier period.
Discontinued operations contributed approximately $1 million of net income or
1 cent per share to both the second quarter of fiscal 2005 as well as the
second quarter of fiscal 2004.
    Net sales were flat compared to the prior period as incremental revenue
from acquisitions in the AG Interactive segment and favorable foreign exchange
movements were offset by lower revenues in both the retail segment and the
fixtures business.  Pretax income increased $27.2 million from a loss of
$17.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 to $9.6 million of income
in the second quarter of fiscal 2005.

    Management Comments
    Zev Weiss, Chief Executive Officer said, "In the second quarter, we were
able to generate much improved performance over last year for both earnings
and cash flow.  The earnings improvement was due primarily to increased income
from licensing, reduced implementation costs related to our ongoing supply
chain transformation and lower interest expense because of our prepayment of
debt.  We were also very pleased by our cash flow results which were driven by
increased earnings and a continued focus on improving our balance sheet."

    Third Quarter and Full Year Estimates
    "For the third fiscal quarter, we are projecting our earnings per share to
be between 67 cents and 72 cents," Weiss said. Last year, the Corporation
reported earnings per share of 60 cents for the third quarter.
    "Our initial fiscal year 2005 earnings estimate of $1.63 to $1.68 per
share was adjusted last quarter to earnings of $1.46 to $1.51 per share to
take into account the costs and benefits from our tender offer," Weiss
continued. "We are not changing the adjusted EPS estimate. However, because
our cash flow was so strong in our first half, we are raising the estimate for
fiscal 2005 cash flow from operating and investing activities by 25% from
$200 million to $250 million."

    Dividend Initiated
    The Corporation's Board of Directors has authorized the initiation of a
quarterly cash dividend of 6 cents per share for shareholders of record at the
close of business on October 19, 2004, payable on October 29, 2004. Weiss
said, "We previously stated that we would announce our plans on ways to
enhance shareholder value in the second fiscal half.  Now, we have taken the
first step in returning capital to shareholders by initiating a dividend."

    Conference call on the Web
    American Greetings will broadcast its conference call live on the Internet
at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time today. The conference call will be accessible
through the Investor Relations section of the American Greetings Web site
at http://corporate.americangreetings.com .  A replay of the call will be
