National Semiconductor Reports $117.7 Million Profit for First Quarter,
29% Revenue Growth Year-to-Year and Record Gross Margin

o    Q1, FY05 earnings are 31 cents per share, up from 8 cents in Q1, FY04

o    Gross margin hit new all-time high of 55%, compared to 47% a year ago

o    Revenues were $548 million, compared to $424.8 million last year

o    Company provides cautious outlook for Q2; sales may decline 8-10% from Q1

SANTA  CLARA,  Calif.,  Sept.  9,  2004  -  National  Semiconductor  Corporation
(NYSE:NSM)  today  reported  a GAAP  profit of $117.7  million,  or 31 cents per
share,  on revenues of $548 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2005,  which
ended August 29, 2004.  National's  first quarter  sales were 29 percent  higher
than the first quarter of fiscal 2004, when the company reported sales of $424.8
million and earnings of 8 cents per share. Sequentially,  National's Q1 revenues
were 4 percent  lower than the fourth  quarter of fiscal 2004,  when the company
recorded revenues of $571 million and earnings of 24 cents per share. National's
fourth quarter 2004 results  included a $30 million pre-tax special charge for a
litigation matter.

In the first  quarter of fiscal  2005,  National  achieved a new record in gross
margin of 55 percent,  up from 54.4 percent in the prior quarter.  For the first
quarter of fiscal 2004, National's gross margin was 47 percent.

"National's  business  over the summer was  affected  by slower  orders  than we
originally anticipated,  particularly from our distribution channel," said Brian
L. Halla, National's chairman, president and CEO. "However, we continued to show
positive  results from our analog  focus and we're  pleased that we were able to
increase gross margin in a seasonally slow quarter. As a result of our continued
focus on selling  higher-value,  higher  margin  analog  products,  we  provided
shareholders with a 28 percent return on invested capital (ROIC) in Q1."


BOOKINGS PATTERNS FOR Q1
National's  worldwide  bookings in Q1 were 5 percent higher than last year's Q1.
But on a sequential basis,  bookings declined 29 percent from the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2004.

The decline in bookings was  attributed to a combination  of factors,  including
seasonally slower demand, shorter lead times --- which prompted distributors and
OEM customers to reduce backlog  coverage --- and supply chain  corrections from
flat panel display customers and some wireless handset customers in Asia.

The   sequential   decline  in  revenues   for  Q1  was   directly   related  to
lower-than-anticipated  turns  orders,  which were  driven by these same  global
market  developments.  Turns orders are orders requested for delivery within the
same quarter.

From a geographic market perspective,  Q1 bookings declined  sequentially in all
regions. Bookings in Europe and Japan were generally stronger than in the United
States and Asia Pacific.  Weekly bookings  improved slightly during the month of
August compared to July. Billings exceeded bookings in the first quarter.
<PAGE>

GUIDANCE FOR Q2, FY2005
National  expects  distributors  and some customers to continue  adjusting order
backlog and inventories in Q2. As a result, the Company anticipates revenues may
decline 8 to 10  percent  sequentially  during  Q2.  This  revenue  range may be
accompanied by gross margin of  approximately  51 percent.  Operating  expenses,
meanwhile, are expected to be comparable to Q1.

"As we work through these inventory adjustments, National will continue to drive
a proven business model that focuses on high-value analog products," Halla said.
"This slowdown won't distract us from pursuing National's  long-term  objectives
to create the best returns for our shareholders."

SPECIAL NOTE
This release contains forward-looking  statements dependent on a number of risks
and  uncertainties  pursuant  to the  safe  harbor  provisions  of  the  Private
Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995. These factors  include,  but are not
restricted to, new orders  received and shipped  during the first  quarter,  the
degree  of  factory  utilization,  the  successful  start  up of  production  in
National's  Suzhou  assembly  and  test  facility,  the sale of  inventories  at
existing prices,  and the ramp up of recently  introduced  products.  Other risk
factors are included in the Company's  10-K for the year ended May 30, 2004 (see
Outlook and Risk Factors  sections of  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of
Financial Conditions and Results of Operations).
