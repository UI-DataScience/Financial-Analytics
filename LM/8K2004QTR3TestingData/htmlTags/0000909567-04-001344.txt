<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Nortel Networks Provides Status Update</B><BR>
<I>Provides Details on Work Plan to Reduce Costs</I>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">TORONTO &#151; Nortel Networks* Corporation &#091;NYSE/TSX: NT&#093; and its principal
operating subsidiary, Nortel Networks Limited (&#147;NNL&#148;), today provided a status
update pursuant to the alternative information guidelines of the Ontario
Securities Commission. These guidelines contemplate that the Company and NNL
will normally provide bi-weekly updates on their affairs until such time as
they are current with their filing obligations under Canadian securities laws.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company and NNL reported that there have been no material developments in
the matters reported in their status updates of June&nbsp;2, 2004, June&nbsp;29, 2004,
July&nbsp;13, 2004, July&nbsp;27, 2004, August&nbsp;10, 2004, August&nbsp;19, 2004, September&nbsp;2,
2004 and September&nbsp;16, 2004, with the exception of the matters described below.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Work Plan</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Nortel Networks and NNL today announced an update to their work plan previously
announced on August&nbsp;19, 2004, including details concerning anticipated
workforce reductions, the timing for completion and associated updates on
estimated cost and savings impacts. The work plan involves focused workforce
reductions, a voluntary retirement program, real estate optimization and other
cost containment actions such as reductions in information services costs,
outsourced services and other discretionary spending. The Company currently
expects the workforce reduction notifications to be completed by June&nbsp;30, 2005
and the real estate actions to be completed by the end of 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;The decisions made to reduce our employee community and refine operational
efficiencies have been undertaken in a very considered way,&#148; said Bill Owens,
president and chief executive officer, Nortel Networks. &#147;Our workforce actions
are focused to disproportionately protect customer and sales facing roles as
well as continue our focus on new innovative solutions. Our overall objective
is to grow the business and to ensure that we have the appropriate levels of
investment in key growth businesses and markets. The work plan outlined today
will allow us to trim our cost structure by streamlining our business to drive
more efficient operations. This plan demonstrates our commitment to &#145;costs,
cash and revenues&#146; as strategic imperatives in managing our business and
driving growth.&#148;

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U><I>Workforce</I></U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s work plan now includes targeted workforce reductions of
approximately 3,250 employees. Approximately two-thirds of the employees are
expected to be notified by December&nbsp;31, 2004 with the remainder expected to be
notified by June&nbsp;30, 2005. These focused headcount reductions are intended to
result in ongoing cost reductions in research and development expenses,
selling, general and administrative expenses, and cost of sales. These actions
are subject to the completion of required jurisdictional consultation and
regulatory approvals. The anticipated approximate regional impacts of the
reductions are set out below.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U><I>Real Estate</I></U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The work plan also includes the reduction of approximately 2&nbsp;million square
feet of occupied space as a result of the workforce reductions and improved
space utilization through consolidation of locations. The Company expects the
real estate actions to be completed by the end of 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U><I>Costs</I></U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company now estimates charges to the income statement associated with its
overall work plan in the aggregate of approximately US$450&nbsp;million comprised of
approximately US$220&nbsp;million with respect to the workforce reductions and
approximately US$230&nbsp;million with respect to the real estate actions. No
charges are expected to be recorded with respect to the other cost containment
actions. Approximately 35&nbsp;percent of the aggregate income statement charges are
expected to be incurred in 2004 with the remainder in 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The associated cash costs of the work plan of approximately US$430&nbsp;million are
split approximately equally between the workforce reductions and real estate
actions. Approximately 10&nbsp;percent of these cash costs are expected to be
incurred in 2004 and approximately 40&nbsp;percent are expected to be incurred in
2005. The remaining 50&nbsp;percent of the cash costs relates to the real estate
actions and are expected be incurred in 2006 through to 2022 for ongoing lease
costs related to impacted real estate facilities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In addition to the above, the Company also expects to incur capital cash costs
of approximately US$50&nbsp;million in 2005 for facility improvements related to the
real estate actions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Overall costs of the work plan are higher than previous estimates principally
due to more extensive real estate actions which are expected to result in
increased longer term cost savings.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U><I>Cost Savings</I></U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company anticipates cost savings from the implementation of the work plan
of approximately US$500&nbsp;million in 2005, which are expected to increase on an
annualized basis beyond 2005 as the full impact of the work plan is realized.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Business Model</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Nortel Networks continues to expect to reduce its operating expenses to 35
percent of revenues or lower on an annualized basis in 2005. This expectation
takes into consideration the implementation of the work plan as outlined above
and incremental investments associated with the Company&#146;s previously announced
strategic plan including its focus on the government and defense customer
segments, marketing initiatives, and solutions that support secure, reliable,
converged networks.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>EDC Support Facility</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Nortel Networks also announced that NNL has obtained a new waiver from Export
Development Canada (&#147;EDC&#148;) under the EDC performance-related support facility
(the &#147;EDC Support Facility&#148;). It is a waiver of certain defaults related to
the delay by the Company and NNL in filing their respective 2003 Annual Reports
on Form 10-K, Q1 2004 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Q2 2004 Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q (collectively, the &#147;Reports&#148;), in each case with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;), the trustees under the
Company&#146;s and NNL&#146;s public debt indentures and EDC. The waiver also applies to
certain additional breaches under the EDC Support Facility relating to the
delayed filings and the previously announced restatement of the Company&#146;s and
NNL&#146;s financial results.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The new waiver from EDC will remain in effect until the earlier of certain
events including:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">NNL&#146;s prior waiver from EDC, previously announced on August&nbsp;20, 2004, was set
to expire on September&nbsp;30, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The EDC Support Facility provides up to US$750&nbsp;million in support, all
presently on an uncommitted basis. Once the Reports have been filed with the
SEC and the related breaches cured, the US$300&nbsp;million revolving small bond
sub-facility of the EDC Support Facility would again become committed support.
As of September&nbsp;29, 2004, there was approximately US$273&nbsp;million of outstanding
support utilized under the EDC Support Facility, approximately US$201&nbsp;million
of which was outstanding under the small bond sub-facility.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">If the Company and NNL fail to file the Reports within the waiver period, there
can be no assurance that NNL would receive any further waivers or any
extensions of the waiver beyond its scheduled expiry date. If the waiver
announced today expires prior to the filing of such Reports, EDC would have the
right at such time to require NNL to cash collateralize the support outstanding
under the EDC Support Facility and to exercise its rights against the
collateral under related security agreements. As previously announced, the
Company and NNL expect to file the Reports by the end of October&nbsp;2004.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have advised you that (i)&nbsp;the Company and NNC did not file their
Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 (the
&#147;Annual Reports&#148;) with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;) by March&nbsp;15, 2004, the date by which such filings
were required, and with the trustees under the Nortel Indentures and with
EDC under the EDC Facility by the date on which such filings were
required therein, (ii)&nbsp;the Company and NNC did not file their Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2004 (the &#147;First
Quarter Reports&#148;), with the SEC by May&nbsp;10, 2004, the date by which such
filings were required, and with the trustees under the Nortel Indentures
or with EDC under the EDC Facility by the date on which such filings were
required therein, (iii)&nbsp;the Company and NNC did not file their Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2004 (the &#147;Second
Quarter Reports&#148; and, together with the First Quarter Reports, the
&#147;Quarterly Reports&#148;) with the SEC by August&nbsp;9, 2004, the date by which
such filings were required, and with the trustees under the Nortel
Indentures or with EDC under the EDC Facility by the date on which such
filings were required therein; (such failures to timely file and deliver
the Annual Reports, the First Quarter Reports and the Second Quarter
Reports, the &#147;Delayed Filings&#148;); and (iv)&nbsp;the Company has announced that
it will need to restate its previously filed financial results for
certain prior periods (the &#147;Restatements&#148; and together with the Delayed
Filings, the &#147;Events&#148;) as a result of the work done to date by the
independent review undertaken by the Nortel Networks Audit Committee.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Delayed Filings would have resulted, absent the waivers
contained in the Letters, in the occurrence of an Event of Default and a
Specified Event of Default under the EDC Agreement pursuant to the
&#147;cross-default&#148; provision contained in Section&nbsp;6.1(f)(ii), and an Event
of Default under the provisions of Section&nbsp;6.1(d) due to failure or
potential failure to comply with certain information covenants contained
in the EDC Agreement. Section&nbsp;6.1(f)(ii) of the EDC Agreement defines
Event of Default and Specified Event of Default to include the occurrence
of any event that enables the holders of any Material Debt (which is
defined to include each series of the Company&#146;s outstanding debt
securities) to declare such Material Debt due and payable prior to its
scheduled maturity (with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of
time or both).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;6.1(d) of the EDC Agreement defines an Event of Default to
include the failure to observe or perform any covenant or agreement
contained in any Facility Document, including a failure to deliver the
Annual Reports and the Quarterly Reports when required by Sections&nbsp;5.1(a)
and (b), respectively, of the EDC Agreement, and a failure to deliver the
officer&#146;s certificates required by Section&nbsp;5.1(c) of the EDC Agreement,
if any such failure continues for thirty days after notice thereof is
provided by EDC to the Company. In addition, as a result of the
circumstances giving rise to the Restatements, (x)&nbsp;the Company may be in
violation of Section&nbsp;5.7 of the EDC Agreement and (y)&nbsp;the

Agreement may have been incorrect when made or when deemed made.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company requests that EDC waive the occurrence of any Event of
Default or Specified Event of Default resulting from (i)&nbsp;the Delayed
Filings to the extent that such Event of Default or Specified Event of
Default arises under Sections&nbsp;5.1(a), 5.1(b), 6.1(d), or 6.1(f)(ii) of

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waivers contained herein will terminate on the Termination Date.
The &#147;Termination Date&#148; means the earliest to occur of (A)&nbsp;the date on

Quarter Reports and the Second Quarter Reports with the SEC; (B)&nbsp;11:59 pm
Eastern Time on October&nbsp;31, 2004; or (C)&nbsp;for greater certainty, but
without in any way extending the limited waiver contained herein, the
date on which any Material Debt becomes due before its stated maturity.

date hereof no Default, Event of Default, or Specified Event of Default,
other than those specifically waived herein, has occurred and is
continuing under the EDC Agreement.

(i)&nbsp;waives any notice requirement under Section&nbsp;6.1 (d)&nbsp;of the EDC
Agreement with respect to any Event of Default that would otherwise
result from the Events but that is waived herein, (ii)&nbsp;agrees that the
proviso to the last sentence of Section&nbsp;5.7 of the EDC Agreement shall
not apply as long as the waivers contained herein are in effect, and
(iii)&nbsp;agrees that, notwithstanding the provisions of Section&nbsp;2.1(a) of
the EDC Agreement, until such time as the waivers contained herein have
terminated and no Default or Event of Default exists under the EDC
Agreement, any Support (including without limitation any Support under
the Small Bonds Facility) provided by EDC under the EDC Agreement and
under any EDC Support Agreement shall be provided on an uncommitted basis
and at the sole discretion of EDC, subject to such conditions precedent
as EDC may require, including without limitation those applicable to the
Receivables Bonding Facility and the General Support Facility.

Agreement are and shall continue to be in full force and effect and are
hereby in all respects ratified and confirmed. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, the execution, delivery and effectiveness of
