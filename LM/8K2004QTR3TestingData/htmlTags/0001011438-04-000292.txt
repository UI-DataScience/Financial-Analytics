INN OF THE MOUNTAIN GODS RESORT AND CASINO
ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS

Mescalero, New Mexico--(BUSINESS WIRE) Sept. 9, 2004--Inn of the Mountain Gods
Resort and Casino ("IMGRC"), a business enterprise of the Mescalero Apache Tribe
(the "Tribe"), reported today that net revenue for its fiscal quarter ended July
31, 2004 was $22.1 million, an increase of $4.3 million, or 24.2%, from $17.8
million for the prior year first fiscal quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter
ended July 31, 2004 was $8.6 million, an increase of $1.5 million, or 21.1%,
from $7.1 million for the prior year period.

The increase in net revenue was primarily attributable to a growth in gaming
revenue during the period, which was 12.8% higher than last year's first fiscal
quarter, as well as a continuing increase in revenue from retail operations
located at the Travel Center, which opened in May 2003. For the quarter ended
July 31, 2004, the average gross slot win per unit per day was $157 (on a
weighted average number of slot machines of 1,181) versus last year's first
quarter of $166 (on a weighted average number of slot machines of 1,000). The
average table game win per unit per day for the period was $638 (on a weighted
average number of table games of 38) versus last year's first quarter of $565
(on the same weighted average number of table games). The increase in retail
revenue reflects year over year increases in the sales from refueling stations
and smoke shop which offer favorable product pricing relative to other
competitors and to the operation of our convenience store.

Michael French, Chief Operating Officer of IMGRC, in commenting on the
performance stated: "We were very pleased with the increases in revenue in the
first quarter especially since we are now on a comparable basis with last year.
We are also encouraged by the year over year improvement in operating margins in
our food and beverage, retail and recreational segments. The momentum that we
are building is beneficial as we approach the opening of our new resort
facilities." Mr. French went onto to say, "Our focus continues to be on the
on-time opening of the new resort and the effective transition of the old casino
operations."

Construction of IMGRC's new resort and casino is on schedule. Construction costs
incurred on the new resort's fixed price contract through July 31, 2004 were
$113 million leaving the remaining costs to be incurred of $22 million prior to
the opening in April 2005. In addition, there are previously announced scope
changes totaling $5 million relating to the build out of additional guest rooms,
meeting rooms and a fitness center and indoor swimming pool which will be
completed by the opening in April 2005. IMGRC has been informed that funds
relative to an application filed with the federal government for cost
reimbursement for school construction is expected to be received by the Tribe
today. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the bonds issued by
IMGRC, $10 million of these funds will be contributed by the Tribe to the
construction reserve account for construction costs for the new resort.

ABOUT INN OF THE MOUNTAIN GODS RESORT AND CASINO

IMGRC is a business enterprise of the Tribe, a federally recognized Indian tribe
with an approximately 725-square mile reservation situated in the Sacramento

Ski Apache and a new resort project, currently under construction which, upon
completion, will include a 273-room hotel, a new 38,000 square foot casino

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

In this press release, IMGRC makes references to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization and further adjusted to exclude (i) pre-opening costs and expenses
related to construction of IMGRC's new resort and casino, (ii) revenue sharing
and regulatory fees in excess of those payable under the Tribe's new compact and
(iii) other income. IMGRC is an instrumentality of a sovereign Indian tribe and
is not subject to federal or state income tax. IMGRC cautions investors that
amounts presented in accordance with its definition of adjusted EBITDA may not
be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other issuers, because not all
issuers and analysts calculate adjusted EBITDA in the same manner.

Adjusted EBITDA provide an additional way to view IMGRC's operations and, when
viewed with both the GAAP results and reconciliation to net income, IMGRC
believes provides a more complete understanding of its business than could be
obtained absent this disclosure. Adjusted EBITDA is presented solely as a
supplemental disclosure because (i) IMGRC believes it enhances an overall
understanding of IMGRC's past and current financial performance; (ii) IMGRC
believes it is a useful tool for investors to assess the operating performance
of the business in comparison to other operators within the gaming industry
because adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items that may not be indicative of
IMGRC's operating results; (iii) measures that are comparable to adjusted EBITDA
are often used as an important basis for the valuation of gaming companies; and
(iv) IMGRC adjusted EBITDA internally to evaluate the performance of its
operating personnel and also as a benchmark to evaluate its operating
performance in comparison to its competitors.

The use of adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations. Adjusted EBITDA should be
considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, any GAAP
financial measure including net income (as an indicator of IMGRC's performance)
or cash flows provided by operating activities (as an indicator of IMGRC's
liquidity), nor should it be considered as an indicator of IMGRC's overall
financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA eliminate certain substantial recurring
items from net income, such as depreciation and amortization and interest
expense. Each of these items has been incurred in the past, will continue to be
incurred in the future and should be considered in the overall evaluation of
IMGRC's results. IMGRC compensates for these limitations by providing the
relevant disclosure of depreciation and amortization, interest expense and other
items excluded in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA both in its reconciliation
to the GAAP financial measure of net income and in its consolidated financial
statements, all of which should be considered when evaluating its results. IMGRC
strongly encourages investors to review its financial information in its
entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure. A reconciliation of
adjusted EBITDA to net income is included in the selected financial information
that accompanies this press release.

CONFERENCE CALL

IMGRC will discuss its first quarter results during a conference call on
September 10, 2004, at 11:00 a.m. (EST). The call can be accessed via telephone
by dialing (913) 981-5559 and providing the confirmation code 953431. Interested
parties should call at least ten minutes prior to the start of the conference
call to register.

(2)  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Tribe and the State of New
     Mexico settled their outstanding disputes over the computation and payment
     of revenue sharing and regulatory fees. Pursuant to the settlement
     agreement, during the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Tribe signed a
     gaming compact calling for the Tribe to pay the State of New Mexico revenue
     sharing fees of 8.0% of the "net win" from gaming machines and regulatory
     fees of $100,000 per year. Adjusted EBITDA adjusts results for the fiscal
     quarter ending July 31, 2003 to reflect revenue sharing and regulatory fees
     at the levels in the new compact.
