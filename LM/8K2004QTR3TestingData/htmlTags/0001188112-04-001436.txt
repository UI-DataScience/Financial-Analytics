THE MIIX GROUP

NEWS RELEASE

                 THE MIIX GROUP ANNOUNCES COURT PLACES INSURANCE
                          SUBSIDIARY IN REHABILITATION


LAWRENCEVILLE, NJ, SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 - The MIIX Group, Incorporated (OTC: MIIX)
announced today that the Superior Court of New Jersey entered an Order on
September 28, 2004, placing MIIX Insurance Company ("MIIX Insurance"), a
subsidiary of The MIIX Group, Inc., into rehabilitation and naming the
Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance
("Department") as Rehabilitator with immediate and exclusive control over the
business and property of MIIX Insurance. The Order provides that The MIIX Group
and New Jersey State Medical Underwriters, Inc. will continue to provide
administrative services to MIIX Insurance pursuant to the current Management
Services Agreement until terminated by the Department after appropriate notice.
The Order does not stay payment of claims for any litigation currently pending
against MIIX Insurance or its insureds and does not bar claimants from filing
new actions against MIIX Insurance insureds. The Order, however, prohibits
persons from filing any new action or new claim directly against MIIX Insurance
without the permission of the Court.

In addition, all directors and officers of MIIX Insurance and of its two
subsidiaries, Lawrenceville Holdings, Inc. and MIIX Insurance Company of New
York, resigned from their positions, effective September 28, 2004.

Forward-Looking Statement

This news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the
Company's expectations concerning future events and are subject to certain risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those reflected in the forward-looking statements. In particular, the Court's
action in placing an insurance subsidiary into rehabilitation will adversely
affect the Company's ability to manage its runoff and to restructure its
operations or sell its assets and to continue as a going concern. These and
other uncertainties and other factors are detailed from time to time in the
Company's filings with the appropriate securities commissions.
