ITEM 2.02.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

         On September 7, 2004, Lindsay Manufacturing Co. (the "Company") issued
a press release updating its outlook for fiscal 2004 ended August 31, 2004. A
copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.

         The information contained in this Current Report under Item 2.02,
including the exhibit referenced in Item 9.01 below, is being "furnished"
pursuant to "Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition" of Form
8-K and, as such, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section
18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject
to the liabilities of that Section. The information in Item 2.02 of this Current
Report shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or
other document pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as
shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

ITEM 2.06.  MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS.

         The Company will report a charge against earnings of approximately
$850,000 (pretax) in the quarter ended August 31, 2004 resulting from the
insolvency and liquidation of a Kansas irrigation equipment dealer in which the
Company held a minority interest.

         On August 31, 2004, the Company concluded that it will incur bad debt
expense of approximately $600,000 (pretax) on trade receivables due to it from
the dealership. This impairment represents the amount of trade receivables in
excess of bad debt reserves previously established by the Company. On August 30,
2004, assets of the dealership were sold at auction and the proceeds were
applied in part to the Company's trade receivables and, in part, to the
dealership's obligations under bank loans. Results of the auction were available
on August 31, 2004, at which time the Company determined the magnitude of the
impairment charge on its trade receivables. The impairment charge on trade
receivables will not result in future cash expenditures by the Company

         In addition to the impairment of these trade receivables, the Company
expects to make cash payments of approximately $250,000 (pretax) on its
guarantee of certain bank loans relating to the dealership.

         The Company did not recognize an impairment charge on its minority
interest in the dealership since it had previously eliminated its investment in
the dealership to reflect the Company's allocable share of losses incurred by
the dealership.

ITEM 9.01.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.

         99.1     Press Release, dated September 7, 2004, issued by the Company.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELASE
TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 2004

            LINDSAY MANUFACTURING CO. UPDATES OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2004

         CHARGE RELATED TO DEALER WILL IMPACT EPS BY APPROXIMATELY $0.05
  FOURTH-QUARTER REVENUES REMAIN STRONG; FULL-YEAR REVENUES EXCEED EXPECTATIONS

OMAHA, NEB., SEPTEMBER 7, 2004--LINDSAY MANUFACTURING CO. (NYSE: LNN), a leading
manufacturer of center pivot, lateral move, and hose reel irrigation systems,
today updated its outlook for its fiscal year ending August 31, 2004.

The company announced today that, due to the insolvency and liquidation of a
Kansas dealership in which Lindsay held a minority interest, it will take a
charge during the quarter ending August 31, 2004, of approximately $0.05 per
share. The majority of this charge represents a bad debt expense relating to a
Lindsay trade receivable from this dealership. The remaining portion of the
charge represents Lindsay's expected obligation on its limited guarantee of bank
loans related to the dealership. Lindsay's equity investment in the dealership
had previously been eliminated due to its allocation of losses from the
dealership.

Prior to this charge, Lindsay's management had anticipated that full-year fiscal
2004 earnings per share would be slightly above $0.90 per share. The company
also noted that revenues through the fourth quarter remained strong and Lindsay
exceeded its goal of 14 to 16 percent organic revenue growth for fiscal 2004.

Lindsay anticipates releasing its fiscal 2004 fourth-quarter and full-year
earnings during the second full week of October.

ABOUT THE COMPANY
Lindsay manufactures and markets Zimmatic, Greenfield, and Perrot center pivot,
lateral move and hose reel irrigation systems and GrowSmart controls, all of
which are used by farmers to increase or stabilize crop production while
conserving water, energy, and labor. The company also produces large diameter
steel tubing and provides outsourced manufacturing and production services for
other companies. At May 31, 2004, Lindsay had approximately 11.8 million shares
outstanding, which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
LNN.
