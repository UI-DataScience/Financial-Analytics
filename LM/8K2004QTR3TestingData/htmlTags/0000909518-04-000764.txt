NOTE: This release may contain "forward-looking statements" under the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainties.
There can be no assurances that forward-looking statements will be achieved, and
actual results could differ materially from forecasts and estimates. Important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forecasts and
estimates are: risks associated with weaknesses in certain sectors of the global
economy generally, and in certain sectors of the telecommunications industry in
particular; risks associated with rapid technological changes in the
telecommunications industry; risks associated with making significant
investments in the expansion of our business and with increased expenditures;
risks associated with holding a large proportion of our assets in cash
equivalents and short-term investments and the reduction of prevailing interest
rates; risks associated with our products being dependent upon their ability to
operate on new hardware and operating systems of other companies; risks
associated with our dependence on sales of our Signalware products; risks
associated with future networks not utilizing signaling systems and protocols
which our products are designed to support; risks associated with the
development and acceptance of new products and product features; risks
associated with our dependence on a limited number of customers for a
significant percentage of our revenues; risks associated with our products
having long sales cycles and our limited ability to forecast the timing and
amount of product sales; risks associated with the integration of our products
with those of equipment manufacturers and application developers and our ability
to establish and maintain channel and marketing relationships with leading
equipment manufacturers and application developers; risks associated with our
reliance on a limited number of independent manufacturers to manufacture boards
for our products and on a limited number of suppliers for our board components;
risks associated with becoming subjected to, defending and resolving allegations
or claims of infringement of intellectual property rights; risks associated with
others infringing on our intellectual property rights and the inappropriate use
by others of our proprietary technology; risks associated with prevailing
economic conditions and financial trends in the public securities markets in
general, and in the decline in the stock prices of technology companies in
particular, including Ulticom; risks associated with the need for the Company to
attract and retain key personnel and risks associated with the increased
difficulty in relying on equity incentive programs to attract and retain
talented employees and with any associated increased employment costs. These
risks and uncertainties, as well as others, are discussed in greater detail in
the filings of Ulticom with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including
our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Form 10-Q.
All documents are available through the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering Analysis
and Retrieval system (EDGAR) at www.sec.gov or from Ulticom's web site at
