Margo Caribe, Inc. Reports Unaudited Operating Results for the Three Months and
Six Months Ended June 30, 2004.

Vega  Alta,  Puerto  Rico;  August  13,  2004  -  Margo  Caribe,  Inc.  and  its
subsidiaries (the "Company")  reported unaudited operating results for the three
months and six months ended June 30, 2004.

For  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2004,  the  Company  had a net  loss of
approximately $191,000,  compared to a net loss of approximately $77,000 for the
same period in the year 2003. These amounts  represent a diluted loss per common
share of $(0.09) and  $(0.04)  for the six months  ended June 30, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.  The net loss for the six months  ended June 30,  2004,  reflected
profits from the lawn & garden segment,  and the  landscaping  segment that were
offset by a net loss in the plants segment.

For the  second  quarter  ended June 30,  2004,  the  Company  had a net loss of
approximately  $212,000 or $(0.10) per share (diluted),  compared to net loss of
approximately  $122,000  or $(0.06) per share  (diluted)  for the same period in
2003.

The plants  segment's  net loss was  approximately  $388,000  for the six months
ended June 30, 2004,  compared to a net income of approximately  $12,000 for the
six months ended June 30, 2003. The plants segment's net loss was  approximately
$328,000 for the second  quarter ended June 30, 2004,  compared to a net loss of
approximately  $99,000 for the second  quarter ended June 30, 2003. The net loss
from the plants  segment  for the six months and second  quarter  ended June 30,
2004,  was  mainly  attributable  to a  decrease  in net sales of  approximately
$767,000 and  $308,000,  respectively.  The net loss from the plant  segment was
also impacted by a decrease in gross margin of  approximately  72.7% for the six
months ended June 30, 2004, and 113.2% for the quarter ended June 30, 2004.

The total net sales from the plants segment was approximately $1,443,000 for the
six months ended June 30, 2004 compared to approximately $2,210,000 in net sales
for the six  months  ended  June 30,  2003.  The total net sales from the plants
segment was  approximately  $645,000 for the second  quarter ended June 30, 2004
compared to  approximately  $953,000 in net sales for the second  quarter  ended
June 30, 2003. The gross margin from the plants segment was  approximately  8.1%
for the six months ended June 30, 2004,  compared to approximately 29.6% for the
six months  ended June 30, 2003.  The gross  margin from the plants  segment was
approximately  -4.5% for the second  quarter  ended June 30,  2004,  compared to
approximately 33.9% for the second quarter ended June 30, 2003.

Offsetting  the loss from the  plants  segment  for the six  months  and  second
quarter  ended June 30, 2004,  were  commissions  and equity in earnings from an
investment in an unconsolidated  joint venture (Salinas Holdings) for the amount
of approximately $132,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2004 and $57,000 for
the second quarter ended June 30, 2004.

The  landscaping  segment's  net income was  approximately  $113,000 for the six
months ended June 30, 2004, compared to a net loss of approximately $172,000 for
the six months ended June 30, 2003.  The  landscaping  segment's  net income was
approximately  $86,000 for the second quarter ended June 30, 2004, compared to a
net loss of  approximately  $76,000 for the second  quarter ended June 30, 2003.
The 2004 net  income of the  landscaping  segment  includes  the  collection  of
$75,000,  approximately,  from an account  receivable  that had been  previously
written down.  Gross revenues from the  landscaping  segment were  approximately
$973,000  for the six months  ended June 30,  2004,  compared  to  approximately
$689,000  for the six  months  ended  June 30,  2003.  Gross  revenues  from the
landscaping  segment were  approximately  $477,000 for the second  quarter ended
June 30, 2004,  compared to approximately  $285,000 for the second quarter ended
June 30, 2003. The gross margin from the landscaping  segment was  approximately
33.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2004,  compared to  approximately  13.8%
for the six months  ended June 30, 2003.  The gross margin from the  landscaping
segment was  approximately  30.7% for the second  quarter  ended June 30,  2004,
compared to approximately 14.7% for the second quarter ended June 30, 2003.

The lawn & garden  segment's  net income was  approximately  $85,000 for the six
months ended June 30, 2004,  compared to a net income of  approximately  $82,000
for the six months ended June 30, 2003.  The lawn & garden  segment's net income
was approximately  $29,000 for the second quarter ended June 30, 2004,  compared
to a net income of  approximately  $53,000 for the second quarter ended June 30,
2003. Net sales from the lawn & garden segment were approximately $1,722,000 for
the six months ended June 30, 2004, compared to approximately $1,752,000 for the
six months  ended June 30, 2003.  Net sales from the lawn & garden  segment were
approximately  $829,000 for the second quarter ended June 30, 2004,  compared to
approximately  $917,000 for the second  quarter  ended June 30, 2003.  The gross
margin from the lawn & garden segment was approximately 50.8% for the six months
ended June 30, 2004,  compared to  approximately  43.9% for the six months ended
June 30, 2003. The gross margin from the lawn & garden segment was approximately
49.4% for the second  quarter  ended June 30,  2004,  compared to  approximately
44.1% for the second quarter ended June 30, 2003.

Chairman of the Board, President and CEO Highlights

The Chairman of the Board,  President and CEO,  Michael J. Spector,  stated that
results went more or less according to plan with continued  growth and improving
margins  resulting in return to  profitability in the landscaping  segment.  The
lawn and garden  segment  showed an increase in gross  margins  versus the prior
year, even though the Company has experienced higher costs of transportation and
raw  materials  due to the  higher  cost of oil.  The  plant  segment,  however,
continued  to show  losses  with  declining  sales due a lack of plant  material
available  for sale as a result of the  closing  of the  Company's  Barranquitas
facility  last year.  Increased  plant segment sales and profits are expected to
begin during the fourth  quarter as new plant  material  becomes  available  for
sale.

During  the  second  quarter,  public  hearings  were held with  respect  to the
requested  zoning  variances  related the proposed  housing  project in Arecibo,
Puerto  Rico.  There was very little  opposition  to our  project.  Accordingly,
although no assurance can be given, the Company remains optimistic to it will be
able to obtain.

The unconsolidated  joint venture (Salinas Holdings,  Inc.) continues to perform
well.  Sales were  adversely  impacted  during the second  quarter  due to heavy
rains.  The weather has improved and sales, as well as large orders have already
been received for delivery during the third quarter.

Margo  Caribe,  Inc. and its  subsidiaries  (collectively,  the  "Company")  are
actively  pursuing  orders for a number of new product  lines that the Company's
represents,  in Puerto Rico.  During this year the Company  became the exclusive
agent for La Pierre Bleue Belge, S.A., a stone company, located in Belgium, that
produces adoquines  (cobblestones) and tiles for streets,  as well as for public
and private areas. La Pierre Bleue Belge, S.A. is the only producer in the world
that  manufactures blue stones and adoquines that are found in many of the older
towns and cities in Puerto Rico.  The Company  intends to market these stones to
several of the  Municipalties  in Puerto Rico, as well as to various  architects
and developers.

The Company is in the business of growing,  distributing and installing tropical
plants  and  trees.  The  Company  is  also  engaged  in the  manufacturing  and
distribution  of its own line ("Rain  Forest") of planting media and aggregates,
the  distribution  of lawn and garden  products  and also  provides  landscaping
design and installation  services. In addition,  the Company has a participation
in a joint venture in a sod and tree farm in Salinas,  Puerto Rico. Furthermore,
beginning in 2003, the Company acts as sales representative for several consumer
goods brands in Puerto Rico and Mexico.
