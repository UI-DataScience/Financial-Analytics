                      FRED'S REPORTS SECOND quarter RESULTS


MEMPHIS, Tenn. (August 26, 2004) - Fred's Inc. (NASDAQ/NM:  FRED) today reported
financial  results for the second fiscal quarter and six-month period ended July
31, 2004.

     Net income for the second quarter of 2004 totaled $3.1 million or $0.08 per
diluted share versus $4.4 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the year-earlier
period.  For the first half of 2004,  net income was $10.5  million or $0.27 per
diluted share compared with $12.2 million or $0.31 per diluted share in the same
period last year.

     Retail sales by Company stores for the second quarter of 2004 increased 13%
and total sales for the quarter also rose 13% to $340.9  million  versus  $302.3
million in the same  period  last  year.  On a  comparable  store  basis,  sales
increased  4.2% for the  quarter.  For the first half of 2004,  retail  sales by
Company  stores  increased 12% and total sales for the period rose 11% to $682.3
million  compared with $613.0  million in the  year-earlier  period.  Comparable
store sales for the first six months of 2004 increased 3.2% over the same period
last year.

     Commenting on the results, Michael J. Hayes, Chief Executive Officer, said,
"We were  optimistic  about the good start to the quarter we had in May, only to
be  disappointed  in the  results  for  June and  July - with  apparel  and home
furnishings being the two key sales areas hit the hardest.  The impact of softer
sales,  a shift in our sales mix, and  increased  markdowns,  combined  with the
run-up in transportation expenses due to higher diesel fuel costs, trimmed three
cents from planned  earnings per share - as discussed in our July sales release.
The  unanticipated  factor was a sharp  increase in our quarterly LIFO inflation
index, which resulted in an additional one-cent reduction in earnings per share.

     "As we head into the  third  and  fourth  quarters,  we do so with  guarded
optimism,"  Hayes  added.  "We are seeing  some  strength  in the soft lines and
domestics,  but  continue  to  experience  negative  comparable  sales  in  home
furnishings.  Also,  markdowns will probably remain over plan for the balance of
the year as we continue  to bring  inventory  back in line and as our  customers
remain   focused  on  promotional   opportunities.   We  believe  the  continued
improvement in inventory and store fundamentals will pay off for us as consumers
become more confident in their spending with the approach of the holiday season.
Also, our store expansion program remains on track to add 85 to 90 new stores to
our chain in 2004,  with 46 of those  already  opened in the first  half of this
year"

     Fred's gross profit for the second quarter was $94.0 million  compared with
$84.9 million in the prior-year period,  representing an increase of 11% for the
period.  Gross margin for the quarter was 27.6% versus 28.1% last year, with the
decline  reflecting a change in product mix toward basic products,  markdowns on
promotional  products,  the impact of  reinstating  double  coupon on Saturdays,
pharmacy LIFO inflation  index  increase,  and increased  freight  costs.  Gross
profit for the first six months of 2004  increased  10% to $190.8  million  from
$172.9 million in the first half of 2003. Gross margin for the 2004 year-to-date
period was 28.0% versus 28.2% in the same period last year.

     Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2004
increased to 26.1% of sales versus 25.9% of sales in the year-earlier period. On
a  year-to-date  basis in 2004,  selling,  general and  administrative  expenses
increased  to 25.6% of sales  compared  with 25.2% of sales in the first half of
2003. The increase in the expenses for the quarter and  year-to-date  period was
attributable to higher store expenses  relative to sales,  insurance  costs, and
utilities and fuel related increases.

     Operating  income  for the  second  quarter  of 2004  declined  26% to $5.0
million from $6.7 million in the year-earlier period.  Operating income was 1.5%
of sales in the second quarter of 2004 compared with 2.2% of sales in the second
quarter of 2003.  Operating  income for the first half of 2004  declined  12% to
$16.5 million from $18.7 million in the prior-year period.  Operating income for
the  first  half of 2004 was 2.4% of sales  compared  with  3.0% of sales in the
first six months of last year.
