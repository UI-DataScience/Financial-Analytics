Item 2.02.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

         On August 26,  2004,  VA Software  Corporation  ("VA  Software"  or the
"Company")  issued a press  release  regarding  its  financial  results  for the
quarter  and fiscal  year ended July 31,  2004.  A copy of the press  release is
furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and a copy of the financial  statements
included  in the press  release  are filed  separately  as Exhibit  99.2 to this
report.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

         To  supplement  its  consolidated  financial  statements  presented  in
accordance with GAAP, VA Software uses non-GAAP  measures of operating  results,
net income and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP
to exclude certain expenses.  These non-GAAP adjustments are provided to enhance
the user's overall  understanding of the Company's current financial performance
and its  prospects  for the  future.  Specifically,  the  Company  believes  the
non-GAAP results provide useful  information to both management and investors by
excluding  certain  expenses  that it believes  are not  indicative  of its core
operating results.  In addition,  because the Company has historically  reported
non-GAAP  results to the  investment  community,  it believes  the  inclusion of
non-GAAP numbers provides consistency in its financial reporting. Further, these
non-GAAP results are one of the primary indicators the Company's management uses
for  planning  and  forecasting  in future  periods.  The  presentation  of this
additional  information  is not  meant to be  considered  in  isolation  or as a
substitute  for  results  prepared  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States.

                     VA SOFTWARE REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND
                            FISCAL YEAR 2004 RESULTS

 Fourth quarter software revenue grows by 92% year-over-year and total fiscal
      year 2004 company revenue increases 21% compared to fiscal year 2003

FREMONT,  CA--August 26, 2004--VA Software Corporation (Nasdaq:  LNUX), provider
of  the  award-winning   SourceForge(R)  Global  Development   Platform(TM)  for
optimizing  distributed  development,  and parent  company of OSTG,  the leading
online  network of news and  information  sites for IT managers and  development
professionals,  today  announced  financial  results for its fourth  quarter and
fiscal year 2004, ended July 31, 2004.

Total fourth quarter  fiscal 2004 revenue grew 12% to $7.3 million,  compared to
fourth  quarter  fiscal 2003 total  revenue of $6.6  million.  Revenue  from the
software  business  increased 92% to $1.6 million in fourth  quarter fiscal 2004
from $0.8  million in fourth  quarter  fiscal 2003.  Total  revenue for the year
ended July 31, 2004 was $29.3 million,  up 21% compared to $24.2 million for the
year ended July 31, 2003.  Revenue from the software  business  increased 71% to
$5.0  million for the year ended July 31, 2004  compared to $2.9 million for the
year end July 31, 2003.

On a GAAP basis,  the fourth quarter  fiscal 2004 net loss was $0.9 million,  or
$0.01 per share,  compared to last year's  fourth  quarter  fiscal 2003 GAAP net
loss of $2.4 million,  or $0.04 per share.  The fourth  quarter fiscal 2004 GAAP
net loss includes a $12,000 restructuring credit classified in cost of sales due
to the release of remaining  warranty  reserve  associated with the pre-existing
hardware business and a $3,000 charge for amortization of intangible assets. For
the year ended July 31, 2004, the company's  GAAP net loss was $7.6 million,  or
$0.13 per share,  compared to $13.8  million,  or $0.25 per share,  for the year
July 31, 2003.

As specified in the attached reconciliation of net loss as reported to pro forma
net loss, the fourth quarter fiscal 2004 net loss before  non-recurring  charges
was $0.9 million,  or $0.01 per share,  compared to last year's  fourth  quarter
fiscal 2003 net loss before non-recurring  charges of $2.1 million, or $0.04 per
share.  For the year  ended July 31,  2004,  the net loss  before  non-recurring
charges was $6.0  million,  or $0.10 per share,  compared to $12.0  million,  or
$0.22 per share,  for the year ended July 31, 2003. Cash and investments  remain
strong at $45.5 million as of July 31, 2004.

"Our  financial  results  for the fourth  quarter  and for the year  reflect our
emphasis on execution.  Software  revenue  increased to $1.6 million  during the
fourth quarter driven by the addition of 11 new accounts as well as purchases by
our  installed  base.  We enter  fiscal year 2005  having  sold our  SourceForge
solution to 97  customers,"  said Ali Jenab,  President  and CEO.  "We have also
positioned our online business,  OSTG for growth in fiscal year 2005. OSTG, with
its focused  emphasis on providing  up-to-the-minute  news about Linux and other
open source  technologies  to the IT  community,  is poised to capitalize on the
growing  interest  in  open  source  solutions.  In  addition,  OSTG's  recently
announced  strategic  reltationships  with IDG and Yahoo!  expand  OSTG's  reach
beyond our historical advertisers."

Recent Highlights

o    Customers.  During the fourth  quarter of fiscal 2004, VA Software added 11
     new SourceForge  Enterprise Edition accounts,  including Acxiom,  Bank One,
     Bowman  Systems,  First American,  Sony Pictures  Imageworks and the US Air
     Force, among others, to its installed base. In addition, existing customers
     including  Pfizer,   Hewlett  Packard,   Fleet  Numerical  Meteorology  and
     Oceanography  Center,  TNO and Los  Alamos  National  Laboratory  purchased
     additional SourceForge licenses and services.

o    SourceForge  Enterprise Edition 4.1. SourceForge Enterprise Edition 4.1 was
     released  in June.  The latest  release is built on a  platform-independent
     Java 2 Enterprise  Edition(TM)(J2EE)  architecture and includes an open API
     and  complementary  software  development kit. These  enhancements  make it
     easier  to  integrate  with  a  wide  range  of  third-party  applications,
     authentication  systems,   databases,   software  configuration  management
     systems and in-house  tools.  A  significantly  enhanced and more intuitive
     user  interface  is also a key new  feature  of this  release.  SourceForge
     Enterprise  Edition  4.1  allows  customers  to  lower  development  costs,
     increase  development  efficiency,  and improve development  visibility and
     control beyond the results provided by earlier releases of the product.

o    OSTG.  Formerly known as OSDN, OSTG (Open Source  Technology  Group) is the
     leading  network  of  news  and  information  sites  for  IT  managers  and
     development  professionals.  During  the fourth  quarter,  in  addition  to
     announcing its new name, OSTG relaunched  several of its IT-focused  sites.
     The name change to OSTG reflects the company's  long-term  strategy to meet
     the evolving information needs of its growing audience,  and address market
     trends driving the rapid adoption of Open Source  technologies for business
     and the desktop. For the tenth-consecutive  quarter,  based on composition,
     OSTG has been named the number one network for delivering visitors who look
     for technology  news online and for  delivering  visitors who make software
     purchases online,  according to the  Nielsen//NetRatings  @Plan Summer 2004
     Report.

     OSTG continues to experience rapid traffic growth and increased advertising
     revenue while  maintaining its commitment to a  community-based  technology
     audience   working   with  a   range   of   platforms   and   technologies.
     SourceForge.net(R), the world's largest repository of Open Source software,
     continues  to break new  records  with over  900,000  registered  users and
     86,000  projects.  Two  Microsoft  projects  released  under the  company's
     "Shared Source  Initiative" are in the top 10% of active projects hosted on
     SourceForge.net.  The network as a whole  serves more than 250 million page
     views,  and 16 million unique visitors  monthly.* This ranks OSTG among the
     top  technology  networks  both in  terms  of size  and  purchasing  power.
     Advertisers   and  sponsors  of  the  network   include   Microsoft,   IBM,
     Hewlett-Packard,  Intel, Red Hat, Legato, AMD, Sun Microsystems,  Interland
     and Rackspace.

o    OSTG   Strategic   Relationships.    OSTG   announced   several   strategic
     relationships  designed to expand its reach beyond historical  advertisers.
     On August 5, 2004,  OSTG  announced a marketing  and sales  agreement  with
     International  Data Group (IDG),  where IDG's Global Solutions' sales force
     will sell  advertising  on OSTG's  network  of sites  giving  international
     technology  advertisers  more  media  options  and  exposing  them  to  the
     fast-growing  global open source  community.  On August 17, OSTG  announced
     that it would  expand  its site and Web  search  capabilities  with  Yahoo!
     Search  Technology and add  contextually-relevant  paid  advertising to its
     sites using Overture Services' Content Match product.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted
accounting  principles,  or GAAP, VA Software uses non-GAAP  financial  results.
Non-GAAP net income and earnings per share  exclude  amortization  of intangible
assets and deferred  stock  compensation,  impairment  of  goodwill,  intangible

<PAGE>

assets and other long-term assets,  remeasurement of warrant liability,  as well
as restructuring costs and other special charges. These non-GAAP adjustments are
provided  to  enhance  the user's  overall  understanding  of current  financial
performance and prospects for the future. Specifically, VA believes the non-GAAP
results provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding
certain  non-recurring  expenses  that VA believes  are not  indicative  of core
operating results.  In addition,  because VA has historically  reported non-GAAP
results to the  investment  community,  VA believes  the  inclusion  of non-GAAP
numbers provides  consistency in financial  reporting.  Further,  these non-GAAP
results are one of the  primary  indicators  management  uses for  planning  and
forecasting in future periods. The method VA uses to produce non-GAAP results is
not  computed  according  to GAAP,  is likely to differ from the methods used by
other companies and should not be regarded as a substitute for results  prepared
in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in the United
States.
