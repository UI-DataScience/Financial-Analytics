FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
- ---------------------


           DONALDSON COMPANY ANNOUNCES RECORD FULL-YEAR SALES AND EPS

     EPS UP 12 PERCENT TO $1.18 MARKING 15TH CONSECUTIVE RECORD YEAR. RECORD
      $1.4 BILLION SALES; STRONG BACKLOGS SUPPORT OUTLOOK FOR DOUBLE-DIGIT
                      EARNINGS GROWTH AGAIN IN FISCAL 2005

         MINNEAPOLIS, August 31, 2004 -- Donaldson Company, Inc. (NYSE: DCI),
today reported diluted earnings per share of $0.29 for the fourth fiscal quarter
ended July 31, 2004, unchanged from last year. Net income was $26.2 million,
compared to $27.1 million last year. Sales were a record $384.0 million, up from
$330.3 million last year.
         For the year, diluted earnings per share were a record $1.18, compared
to $1.05 last year. Net income totaled a record $106.3 million, compared to
$95.3 million last year. Record sales of $1.415 billion compared to $1.218
billion last year.
            "Our fourth quarter was marked by three substantial expense
adjustments," said Bill Cook, Donaldson's president and chief executive officer.
"The cumulative impact of these unusual expenses in the quarter was $11.6
million or $0.08 per share. Obviously, these expenses had a significant impact
on our quarterly results and kept a very good fourth quarter from being another
net income record; however, we felt that it was fiscally prudent to make these
adjustments now given the facts as we see them."
         The adjustments in the fourth quarter that reduced pre-tax income by
$11.6 million are as follows:

o        On August 12, the U.S. Federal District Court ruled that damages
         against Donaldson in the previously disclosed patent infringement
         lawsuit brought by Engineered Products Company, Inc. should be
         approximately $16 million. While we intend to vigorously challenge the
         judgment and will appeal the decision to the Federal Circuit Court of
         Appeals, we increased our reserve for this matter by $5.0 million.

o        As a result of ongoing discussions on a specific warranty-related
         matter, we increased our warranty reserve by $3.0 million.

o        During our year-end closing process, we identified an adjustment of
         $3.6 million relating to a fiscal 2003 transaction between several
         Ultrafilter entities.

          "Coupled with strong sales growth again this quarter, our results
would have been very strong without the matters discussed above," said Cook. "We
began recovering last quarter's steel price increases and worked hard to bring
our operating expense run-rate back down to prior year levels. Net of the
matters discussed above, the fourth quarter numbers show a solid gross margin
and operating expenses below the target level we discussed during the third
quarter webcast."
         "The good news is that broad strength across most of our end markets
and our ability to capitalize on it drove record earnings in fiscal 2004. We
have transitioned from three years of weak conditions in many of our end markets
to rapid demand acceleration this year, and the Donaldson people responded by
ramping up operations quickly to capture the opportunity."

         Factors contributing to the quarter include:

o        Strong Engine Products results.

         >>       North American truck build rates again increased significantly
                  and off-road equipment markets strengthened.

         >>       Equipment utilization improved in both the truck and off-road
                  markets, spurring aftermarket parts sales growth.

         >>       North American regulations at both federal and state levels
                  continue to create strong demand for our diesel truck emission
                  control products.

         >>       Finally, our European and Asian businesses experienced strong
                  demand for both truck and off-road equipment filters.

o        Continued solid demand for disk drive filters. Our disk drive filter
         business remained strong, delivering another quarter of over 20 percent
         sales growth as demand for computer hard drives remained high.

o        Improving conditions for gas turbine. Gas turbine grew sales for the
         first time in eight quarters.

         "Despite the operating leverage realized from higher production
volumes, gross margin was down from last year due to the impact of the
aforementioned expense adjustments and steel price increases," said Cook. "We
began recovering a significant portion of last quarter's steel price increases
during the quarter, but saw another round of steel price increases which will
require additional price recovery from our customers."

INCOME STATEMENT DISCUSSION
         The impact of foreign currency translation during the fourth quarter,
led by the Euro, increased sales by $9.4 million and net earnings by $0.7
million. For the year, currency translation increased sales by $70.0 million and
net earnings by $4.7 million. Worldwide sales, excluding the impact of currency
translation, increased 13.4 percent during the quarter and 10.4 percent for the
year.
         Excluding the impact of currency translation, fourth quarter sales
outside the U.S. increased 9.3 percent, primarily reflecting strong sales growth
in Asia. For the year, excluding the impact of currency translation, sales
outside the U.S. increased 11.1 percent.
         Gross margin of 31.3 percent for the quarter compared to 32.5 percent
last year. For the year, gross margin was 31.8 percent, compared to 32.1 percent
last year. Steel price increases offset the operating leverage gained from
higher production volumes. We recovered a significant portion of the third
quarter's steel price increases this quarter, but another round of steel price
increases experienced in the fourth quarter will require additional price
recovery from our customers. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by $2.3
million from the intercompany

matter discussed above. There were no plant rationalization costs in the quarter
versus $0.02 last year. For the year, plant rationalization costs were $0.05 per
share, unchanged from last year.
         Fourth quarter operating expenses were 22.6 percent of sales, up from
21.2 percent last year. For the year, operating expenses as a percent of sales
were 22.2 percent, up from 21.3 percent last year. Included in fourth quarter
operating expenses were the following adjustments: a $5.0 million increase to
our reserve for the patent infringement judgment; a $3.0 million increase to our
warranty reserve; and $1.3 million from the intercompany matter discussed above.
         Fourth quarter interest expense was $1.3 million, flat with last year.
For the year, interest expense was $5.0 million versus $5.9 million last year.
Other income was $2.5 million in the quarter, up from $1.3 million last year,
driven by a small foreign exchange gain versus a loss last year and higher
interest income. For the year, other income was $5.2 million, compared to $4.7
million last year.
         The tax rates of 24.2 percent for the quarter and 25.0 percent for the
year compare to prior year tax rates of 27.0 percent for both the quarter and
the year. The decrease in the quarter reflects the increased contribution from
our international operations. We expect the tax rate to return to approximately
27 percent in fiscal 2005.
         During the quarter, we repurchased 281,000 shares for $7.6 million as
part of our ongoing share repurchase plan. For the year, 1,071,000 shares, or
1.2 percent of outstanding shares, were repurchased for a total of $29.8
million.

BACKLOG
         The 90-day backlog, reflecting continued strong demand in the upcoming
quarter, was $209 million, up 14 percent, or $26 million, relative to last year.
In Engine Products, the 90-day backlog increased 13 percent over last year. In
Industrial Products, the 90-day backlog increased 15 percent. Notably, the
worldwide industrial air filtration 90-day backlog increased 32 percent.
         Total backlog was $376 million, up 20 percent, or $62 million, relative
to last year. In Engine Products, total backlog increased 28 percent from last
year. In Industrial Products, total backlog increased 7 percent from fiscal
2003.

OUTLOOK
         ENGINE PRODUCTS: Overall, Donaldson expects low-teens sales growth for
Engine Products in fiscal 2005.

o        The company expects continued growth in North American heavy-duty truck
         build rates in fiscal 2005. Order rates and backlogs for diesel
         emission products continue to ramp up. Business conditions remain
         strong in Europe and Asia.
o        Off-road sales are expected to remain strong in Asia and North America
         as conditions in construction and agriculture equipment markets have
         brightened.
o        Both North American and international aftermarket sales are expected to
         continue growing as increasing equipment utilization spurs replacement
         filter sales. Diesel

         emission retrofit sales in North America are anticipated to continue
         increasing as the company's technology solution gains acceptance.

         INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS: Donaldson expects improving conditions for its
industrial businesses to generate low-teens sales growth in fiscal 2005.

o        Global business conditions for gas turbine are expected to be stable.
         Full-year sales are expected to be unchanged compared to fiscal 2004.

o        Industrial filtration solutions sales are expected to be strong in
         fiscal 2005. American and European industrial air and compressed air
         filtration markets are expected to continue improving near-term, as
         order trends are stronger than last year's levels. Business conditions
         in Asia remain strong. Industrial hydraulic order trends continue to be
         favorable.

o        Special applications products showed continued strength in orders and
         backlogs for disk drive filters and membranes, although disk drive's
         growth rate is expected to be lower following fiscal 2004's strong
         recovery.

         Commenting on fiscal 2005's outlook, Cook said, "Despite the difficult
comparisons we will face this year, the strong business trends from 2004 are
still present as we enter 2005 and should provide the opportunity for continued
top-line growth. We expect that increasing commodity prices, especially steel,
will be mostly offset by price increases and improving manufacturing
efficiencies from continued strong volume. We will continue to focus on
operating expense controls and expect that the charges that hampered 2004 will
not repeat in 2005."
         "We are increasingly persuaded that investors are acknowledging our
demonstrated commitment to increasing shareholder value. Through our 15
consecutive record years, Donaldson's earnings have compounded at better than 15
percent, and that operating success has been translated into a 21 percent growth
rate in Donaldson's share price. We are committed to making 2005 the 16th year
in that string."

</TABLE>

Although free cash flow, EBITDA, net sales excluding foreign currency
translation and net earnings excluding foreign currency translation are not
measures of financial performance under GAAP, the company believes they are
useful in understanding its financial results. Free cash flow is a commonly used
measure of a company's ability to generate cash in excess of its operating
needs. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of operating earnings less non-cash
expenses. Both net sales and net earnings excluding foreign currency translation
provide a comparable measure for understanding the operating results of the
company's foreign entities excluding the impact of foreign exchange. A
shortcoming of these financial measures is that they do not reflect the
company's actual results under GAAP. Management does not intend these items to
be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures.
