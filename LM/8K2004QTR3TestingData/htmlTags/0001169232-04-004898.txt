                       NATIONAL TECHNICAL SYSTEMS REPORTS
                  FISCAL 2005 SECOND QUARTER, SIX-MONTH RESULTS

CALABASAS, CA (September 13, 2004) . . . . National Technical Systems, Inc.
(Nasdaq:NTSC) (NTS), a leading provider of quality and conformance testing and
managed services for industries, including aerospace, defense,
telecommunications and information technology, today announced results for its
fiscal 2005 second quarter and six months ended July 31, 2004.

      According to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jack Lin, Ph.D., net
revenues for the fiscal 2005 second quarter were $27.1 million, with net income
of $242,000, or $0.03 per fully diluted share, compared to total net revenues of
$27.2 million, with net income $341,000, or $0.04 per fully diluted share for
the year-earlier period. For the first six months of fiscal 2005, total net
revenues were $54.4 million, with net income of $775,000, or $0.09 per basic
share and $0.08 per fully diluted share. Net revenues for the first six months
of fiscal 2004 were $54.0 million with net income of $668,000, or $0.08 per
basic share and $0.07 per fully diluted share.

      The income tax rates for the three months and six months of fiscal 2005
were lower than the income tax rates for the same periods in fiscal 2004 due to
the earnings associated with the Company's foreign subsidiary which
significantly increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 and are considered
to be permanently invested and consequently no provision for U.S. federal or
state income taxes are provided for this subsidiary.

      President and Chief Operating Officer William C. McGinnis commented,
"While we are disappointed that we did not see a continuation of top- and
bottom-line growth in this fiscal year's second quarter, we remain focused on
increasing revenues and profits and believe that we are well positioned to
recover from this interruption in the momentum we began generating last year. We
are continuing to concentrate on expanding our service offerings both
domestically and internationally, and are pursuing opportunites to cost
effectively increase our services in existing


                                      -1-
<PAGE>

markets in locations close to our customers, as well as to expand our services
into new growth markets. We believe that these investments will produce positive
results."

      During the first half of this fiscal year, NTS invested in expanding its
Detroit testing facility by increasing its airbag testing capabilities to
include rollover airbags to meet the demands of automotive manufacturers.
Rollover airbags are the latest innovation in passenger protection and require
intensive testing to verify performance. Since vehicle safety is an automotive
industry focus, NTS expects to see a number of innovations in this area, which
should lead to additional testing requirements.

      Another example of NTS's commitment to its expansion strategy was its
recent acquisition of a small testing laboratory in Calgary, Canada, which
enhances the Company's telecommunication certification and testing services and
augments its plans for increasing its capabilities in wireless product
certification and testing. The acquisition of this lab has also made it possible
for NTS to concurrently enter into a testing agreement with a large Canadian
telecommunication manufacturer. Strategically, this addition enables NTS to
offer convenient services to other companies located in Canada and the northern
United States.

      The Company's July 31, 2004 balance sheet remained strong, with cash of
$3.2 million, total assets of $64.9 million, shareholders equity of $29.8
million and a current ratio of 3.1:1. The fully diluted share counts used in
calculating earnings per share in the second quarter and first six months of
this fiscal year were 9,541,000 and 9,570,000 respectively, and the fully
diluted share counts used in the comparable periods of the prior fiscal year
were 9,235,000 and 9,105,000, respectively.

      Revenues from the Engineering & Evaluation segment for the fiscal 2005
second quarter and six months were $15.6 million and $31.3 million,
respectively, compared to $15.7 million and $29.9 million for the year-earlier
periods. Revenues in the segment in both periods were increased by revenues from
the acquisition of DTI Holdings, which was effective late in the fiscal 2004
fourth quarter, increases in the Company's space and automotive testing
businesses, and an improvement in the computer testing business in Japan. These
increases were offset in the 2005 second quarter and partially offset in the
first six months of 2005 by a decrease in passive fiber optic testing and a
decrease in defense related business at the Camden, AK facility, which included
revenues in the prior year from a major contract related to the war on
terrorism. The contract was completed during the second quarter of the prior
year.

      Engineering & Evaluation gross profit as a percentage of revenue in the
second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2005 was 25.7 percent and 26.2
percent, respectively, compared to 28.2 percent and 27.2 percent in the
respective periods in the prior fiscal year. The decline in gross profit margin
percentage in both periods was principally due to the effect of fixed costs and
competitive pricing pressures, combined with decreases in gross profit from the
Company's passive fiber optic testing business and at the Company's Camden
facility.

      Engineering & Evaluation operating income for the fiscal 2005 second
quarter and first six months was $393,000 and $1.2 million, respectively,
compared to $992,000 and $1.7 million for the year earlier periods. Operating
income in the segment was impacted in both periods by increases in selling,
general and administrative expenses, when compared to the same periods in


                                      -2-
<PAGE>

fiscal 2004. These increases were primarily due to one-time start-up costs
associated with the development of new test specifications for emerging wireless
technologies and the development of capabilities to perform testing on new DSL
services, and one-time costs incurred by the Company to prepare for Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that makes reporting on internal controls mandatory
for all SEC registrants, sales costs related to efforts to expand the Company
nationally and internationally and the addition of new sales and customer
service representatives. Selling, general and administrative expenses also
increased due to costs related to the improvement of the Company's internal IT
infrastructure and website.

      Revenues from Technical Solutions for the fiscal 2005 second quarter and
first six months were $11.5 million and $23.1 million, respectively, compared to
$11.6 million and $24.2 million for the year-earlier periods. Technical
Solutions revenues declined in both periods due to continued weakness in the IT
market staffing business.

      In the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2005, Technical
Solutions gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 16.2 percent and 15.7
percent, respectively, compared to 16.0 percent and 15.8 percent in the prior
fiscal year's respective periods. The modest year-to-year increase in gross
profit margin percentage in the fiscal 2005 second quarter was due to an
improvement in contract margins.

      Operating income for Technical Solutions in the fiscal 2005 second quarter
and six months was $203,000 and $322,000, respectively, when compared to $21,000
and $163,000 for the year earlier periods. The increase in Technical Solutions
operating income in both periods was primarily due to reductions in selling
costs associated with lower revenues and administrative cost reductions. The
increase in operating income in the first six months of fiscal 2005 was
partially offset by a decrease in gross profit for the segment.

      The Engineering & Evaluation segment is one of the largest independent
conformity assessment and management system registration organizations in the
U.S., with facilities throughout the U.S. and in Japan and Germany serving a
large variety of high technology industries, including aerospace, defense,
automotive, power products, electronics, computers and telecommunications. In
addition, this segment performs management registration and certification
services to ISO related standards.

      The Technical Solutions segment is a national provider of professional and
specialty staffing services including contract services, temporary and full time
placements, providing specialty solutions services to its customers specifically
in the area of IT, information systems, software engineering and construction
needs. Technical Solutions supplies professionals in support of customers who
need help-desk analysts and managers, relational database administrators and
developers, application and systems programmers, configuration and project
managers, engineering personnel and multiple levels of system operations
personnel.
