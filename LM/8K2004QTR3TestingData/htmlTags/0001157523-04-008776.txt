     MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 27, 2004--

          Conference Call Set for Tuesday, September 28 at 8:00 a.m. CT

     Ault Incorporated (Nasdaq:AULT) reported results for its first quarter
fiscal 2005 ended August 29, 2004. For the fiscal quarter, net sales were $13.1
million, up 21 percent from $10.8 million reported for the first quarter of
fiscal 2004. Company officials noted the increase is due to the continued
improvement in activity throughout North America and Korea.
     For the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recorded a net income
applicable to common stockholders of $117,000 or $0.02 per diluted share,
compared to a net loss applicable to common stockholders of $(960,000), or
$(0.21) per diluted share for the same period last fiscal year.
     Frederick M. Green, Ault president and chief executive officer, commented,
"It has been our goal to return to profitability and we have achieved it. This
accomplishment is the result of several expense reduction initiatives taken over
the last three years. We are now in a position to pursue other strategies that
will grow our revenue in niche markets. We will also continue our expense
reduction efforts in order to remain competitive in the global marketplace. Our
goal is to remain profitable and to achieve revenue gains throughout fiscal 2005
and beyond."
