Item 2.02.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

On September 23, 2004, we announced our financial position and results of
operations as of and for our second quarter, ended August 28, 2004. The press
release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by
reference.

The announcement includes a non-GAAP financial measure, "Adjusted EBITDA."

Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) from operations excluding the
impact of income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, LIFO
adjustments, charges or credits for store closing and impairment, inventory
write-downs related to closed stores, stock-based compensation expense, debt
modifications and retirements, litigation proceeds, litigation expense,
expense of the defense against litigation related to prior managements'
business practices and the defense of prior management, sales of assets and
investments, and non-recurring items. We reference this non-GAAP financial
measure frequently in our decision-making because it provides supplemental
information that facilitates internal comparisons to historical operating
performance of prior periods and external comparisons to competitors'
historical operating performance. In addition, incentive compensation is based
on Adjusted EBITDA and we base our forward-looking estimates on Adjusted
EBITDA to facilitate quantification of planned business activities and enhance
subsequent follow-up with comparisons of actual to planned Adjusted EBITDA. We
include this non-GAAP financial measure in our earnings announcement in order
to provide transparency to investors and enable investors to compare our
operating performance with the operating performance of our competitors.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


                   RITE AID ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER RESULTS

               REPORTS SECOND QUARTER NET INCOME OF $9.8 MILLION
               COMPARED TO A LOSS OF $10.6 MILLION IN PRIOR YEAR

           ACHIEVES SECOND QUARTER ADJUSTED EBITDA OF $171.2 MILLION

        Completes Refinancing That Lowers Borrowing Costs, Reduces Debt

                         Confirms Fiscal 2005 Guidance

CAMP HILL, PA, September 23, 2004--Rite Aid Corporation (NYSE, PCX: RAD) today
announced financial results for its second quarter, ended August 28, 2004.

Revenues for the 13-week second quarter were $4.12 billion versus revenues of
$4.05 billion in the prior year second quarter. Revenues increased 1.8 percent.

Same store sales increased 2.0 percent during the second quarter as compared to
the year-ago like period, consisting of a 2.1 percent pharmacy same store sales
increase and a 1.8 percent increase in front-end same store sales. Prescription
sales accounted for 63.9 percent of total sales, and third party prescription
sales represented 93.3 percent of pharmacy sales.

Net income for the second quarter increased to $9.8 million or $.00 per diluted
share compared to last year's second quarter net loss of $10.6 million or a
$.04 loss per diluted share. The improvement was due primarily to an $18.3
million or 12.0 percent increase in adjusted EBITDA (which is reconciled to net
income on the attached table) and an $11.0 million reduction in LIFO expense
partially offset by a $13.9 million store closing and impairment charge which
compared to a $9.0 million store closing and impairment credit in the prior
year quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $171.2 million or 4.2 percent of revenues. This
compares to $152.9 million or 3.8 percent of revenues for the like period last
year.

"Our performance in the second quarter improved in line with our expectations,
with adjusted EBITDA up 12 per cent as compared to the same quarter last year,"
said Mary Sammons, Rite Aid president and CEO. "We remain very focused on our
initiatives to further grow our business the second half of the year."

In the second quarter, the company opened one new store, relocated 2 stores,
acquired two stores, remodeled 57 stores and closed 7 stores. Stores in
operation at the end of the quarter totaled 3,370.

Refinancing Lowers Borrowing Costs, Reduces Debt
- ------------------------------------------------

Rite Aid said today that it has completed a previously announced refinancing
that includes a new $1.4 billion senior secured credit facility and a $400
million three-year securitization facility. The new credit facility consists of
a $450 million term loan and a $950 million revolving credit facility that will
mature in September 2009. The new accounts receivable securitization facility
will mature in September 2007.

Proceeds of the new credit and securitization facilities and approximately $330
million of available cash on hand was used to repay the company's existing
$1.15 billion senior secured credit facility due April 2008 and to replace the
company's existing $700 million revolving credit facility. The new $950 million
revolving credit facility will be drawn down by approximately $60 million at
closing.

This refinancing lowers overall borrowing costs by approximately $27 million
annually and reduces debt by $634 million to approximately $3.2 billion. The
refinancing will result in a pre-tax charge of approximately $16 million at
closing, consisting of an $11.5 million prepayment penalty and a non-cash
charge of $4.5 million for the write-off of deferred debt issue cost.

"We continue to reduce debt and improve the financial flexibility of our
company," said Sammons. "With this new refinancing, we also have more capital
available to invest in our business as we continue to focus on growth."

Company Confirms Guidance for Fiscal 2005
- -----------------------------------------

Based on current trends, Rite Aid confirmed its' fiscal 2005 guidance for
sales, net income and adjusted EBITDA. The company said it expects sales to be
between $16.9 billion and $17.0 billion, with same store sales improving 2.75
percent to 3.25 percent. Net income for fiscal 2005 is expected to be between
$122 million and $150 million or between $.16 and $.22 per diluted share.
Adjusted EBITDA (which is reconciled to net income on the attached table) is
expected to be between $770 million and $800 million. Capital expenditures are
expected to be between $275 million and $325 million.
