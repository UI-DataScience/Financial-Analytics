FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Wednesday, September 15, 2004

                    FALCON PRODUCTS ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR
                    -------------------------------------
                          FISCAL 2004 THIRD QUARTER
                          -------------------------

         ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI, SEPTEMBER 15, 2004 -- Falcon Products, Inc.
(NYSE: FCP), a leading manufacturer of commercial furniture, today announced
net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 of $58.4 million, compared
with $62.3 million for the third quarter ended August 2, 2003.

         Excluding restructuring charges and other one time charges, the
Company's results would have been a net loss of $5.1 million or $0.52 per
share in the third quarter of 2004, compared with a net loss of $0.8
million, or $0.08 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2003, due to
lower volumes year-to-year and increased interest cost. The charges in the
third quarter of 2004 included a $9.5 million loss on early extinguishment
of debt ($6.5 million relates to the non cash expense of the fair value of
the warrants issued per the June 15, 2004 senior credit facility waiver) and
a $4.9 million restructuring charge related to the closure of manufacturing
facilities. The charges in the third quarter of 2003 included a $1.6 million
loss on early extinguishment of debt, a $1.8 million loss on curtailment of
the pension plan and a $4.3 million restructuring charge related to the
closure of the manufacturing facilities. The Company's reported results for
the third quarter of 2004 were a net loss of $19.5 million or $1.98 per
share, compared with a net loss of $5.6 million or $0.62 per share in the
third quarter of 2003.

         As a result of its third quarter operating performance, the Company
was not in compliance with financial covenants under its credit agreement as
of July 31, 2004 and is exploring various alternatives. Based upon
discussions with several potential lending institutions, the Company
believes it will be able to refinance its senior credit facility on

terms that will give the Company the ability to complete its planned operating
improvements and position itself to return to profitability.

         "Our focus on improving operational performance is showing
measurable results, but there are significant challenges that we are
aggressively addressing and intend to resolve. We are optimistic that we can
complete new financing in the near future," Franklin A. Jacobs, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, stated. "As our corporate team is working on this
challenge, we want to assure our customers that we're producing their
products to the high standards they expect and demand, and we're delivering
on time and on budget."

         Falcon Products, Inc. will conduct a conference call to discuss
fiscal 2004 third quarter results on September 20, 2004 at 10:00 a.m. EDT.
The call will be Web cast at www.companyboardroom.com and
www.falconproducts.com.
