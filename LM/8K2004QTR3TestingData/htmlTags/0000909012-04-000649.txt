PRESS RELEASE
For Immediate Distribution

                STEELCLOUD ANNOUNCES FISCAL THIRD QUARTER RESULTS

Dulles, VA (September 14, 2004) - SteelCloud Inc. (Nasdaq: SCLD), today
announced financial results for its 2004 fiscal third quarter, which ended July
31, 2004. Revenues for the quarter were $6,600,296 compared to $8,156,414
million in fiscal third quarter 2003. Revenues increased by $808,532 compared to
fiscal second quarter 2004. The Company recorded a net third quarter loss of
$1,076,927 compared to net earnings of $10,308 in the previous fiscal year third
quarter. Net loss per share was $.08 in fiscal third quarter 2004 compared to
earnings of $.01 per share in the previous fiscal year third quarter.

"Although Q3 revenues were up modestly from Q2, our fiscal year-to-date results
are disappointing," said Thomas P. Dunne, SteelCloud Chairman and CEO. "Third
quarter gross profits were adversely affected by new contract start-up costs. On
the positive side, however, recent fourth quarter order activity has increased
our working backlog by 50% - from $14 million at the beginning of the quarter to
$21 million - not including additional contract options for six million dollars,
which will bring total backlog to $27 million. New order activity has been
driven by several factors... economic turnaround, innovative engineering and
recent ISO 9001 certification. Starting in the fourth quarter the company will
experience growth in revenues, margins, and profitability. I am optimistic about
our current business model and future prospects."
