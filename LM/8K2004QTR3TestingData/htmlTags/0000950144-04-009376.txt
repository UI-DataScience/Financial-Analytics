FIRST ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR 2004
FINANCIAL RESULTS

NASHVILLE, TN, September 27, 2004 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- First Acceptance
Corporation (NYSE: FAC) today reported its financial results for the fourth
quarter and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.

KEY HIGHLIGHTS

         o        Successful completion on April 30, 2004 of the acquisition of
                  USAuto Holdings, Inc. ("USAuto") for $76 million in cash that
                  was raised in part by a rights offering to existing
                  shareholders and the issuance of 13,250,000 shares to the
                  shareholders of USAuto.

         o        From the date of acquisition to June 30, 2004 (two months),
                  the insurance operations produced revenues of $18.2 million
                  and income before tax of $3.3 million, reporting a combined
                  ratio of 74.8% (after adjusting expenses for ceding
                  commissions from reinsurer and fee income) which included a
                  loss ratio of 61.1% over the same period.

ACTUAL RESULTS

         The net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2004 (which includes
two months of insurance operations) was $6.1 million, or a net loss of $0.16 per
share on a fully-diluted basis, compared to a net loss of $0.8 million, or a net
loss of $0.04 on a fully-diluted basis, for the same period of fiscal 2003.
Total revenues grew from $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 to $18.4
million in the fourth quarter of 2004 as a result of the inclusion of USAuto's
non-standard automobile insurance operations. Total expenses for the 2004 period
include $3.3 million of severance costs and $7.6 million in stock-based
compensation to terminated employees. Total weighted average diluted shares
increased from 20.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 to 38.2 million in the
fourth quarter of 2004 as a result of the rights offering and USAuto
acquisition.

         The net loss for the year ended June 30, 2004 was $3.8 million, or a
net loss of $0.15 per share on a fully-diluted basis, compared to a net loss of
$1.9 million, or a net loss of $0.09 on a fully-diluted basis, for fiscal 2003.
Total weighted average diluted shares increased from 20.4 million in fiscal 2003
to 25.0 million in fiscal 2004 as a result of the rights offering and USAuto
acquisition.

PRO FORMA RESULTS

         On a pro forma basis, for the year ended June 30, 2004 (assuming that
the acquisition of USAuto took place on July 1, 2002), total revenues were
$100.3 million, compared to $80.4 million for fiscal 2003. On a pro forma basis,
net income increased 27%, from $9.1 million in fiscal 2003 to $11.6 million in
fiscal 2004, and, on a fully-diluted basis, net income per share increased 26%,
from $0.19 in fiscal 2003 to $0.24 in fiscal 2004.

INSURANCE OPERATIONS

         o        KEY RATIOS - The Company's loss ratio was 61.1% for the period
                  from April 30, 2004 (the date of the USAuto acquisition) to
                  June 30, 2004. On a pro forma basis, for the year ended June
                  30, 2004, the Company's loss ratio improved to 63.4% from
                  67.5% for fiscal 2003 and the combined ratio improved to 79.2%
                  from 80.6% over the same period.

         o        OFFICE EXPANSION - During the three months ended June 30,
                  2004, the Company opened 13 new offices in four states,
                  bringing the total number to 139 offices in seven states. This
                  increase compares to two new offices opened during the same
                  period last year. During the year ended June 30, 2004, the
                  Company opened 30 new offices compared to 17 during the same
                  period last year, and 13 during the same period in 2002. The
                  30 new offices opened in fiscal 2004 were profit neutral in
                  fiscal 2004, but are expected to be accretive during fiscal
                  2005. Between June 30, 2004 and August 31, 2004, the Company
                  opened an additional seven offices, bringing the total number
                  of offices to 146.

         o        PREMIUM GROWTH - On a pro forma basis, for the three months
                  ended June 30, 2004, net premiums earned increased by 43% to
                  $17.5 million, as compared to $12.2 million for the same
                  period last year. The increase was driven by an increase in
                  the percentage of reinsurance assumed on business written in
                  Alabama (increased from 15% to 50% effective February 2004) in
                  addition to a 6% increase in the number of average policies in
                  force.

                  On a pro forma basis, for the year ended June 30, 2004, net
                  premiums earned increased by 50% to $57.7 million, as compared
                  to $38.4 million for fiscal 2003. The increase was due to the
                  previous-mentioned increase in the percentage of reinsurance
                  assumed on business written in Alabama and a 5% increase in
                  average policies in force.

         o        REINSURANCE - During the quarter and year ended June 30, 2004,
                  the Company ceded approximately 50% of its earned premiums.
                  Based on the increase in available statutory capital and
                  surplus as a result of the USAuto acquisition, the Company
                  elected not to renew its quota share reinsurance treaty
                  effective September 1, 2004. For the year ended June 30, 2004,
                  ceded premiums earned by the reinsurer were $44.4 million.

REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS

         During the three months ended June 30, 2004, the Company sold one
property of 1.3 acres in San Antonio, Texas for net sales proceeds of $26,000,
which was equal to its carrying value. For the year ended June 30, 2004, a total
of ten properties, totaling $4.6 million in sales proceeds, were sold, producing
a gain of $4.1 million.

                                       2

<PAGE>


         On July 7, 2004, the property and deed for 41 acres the Company owned
in Arlington, Texas was taken by the City of Arlington upon foreclosure of a tax
lien with no recourse to the Company. An accrual of $433,000 for potential
liability for taxes will be reversed in the first fiscal quarter of 2005.

         The Company has six parcels of land remaining to be sold in the San
Antonio area, totaling 310 acres, with a book value of $1.1 million at June 30,
2004.

CASH AND INVESTED ASSETS

         The Company completed a rights offering of its common stock on April
30, 2004, which produced net proceeds of approximately $49.4 million. Prior to
the transaction, the Company had unrestricted cash totaling $58.9 million,
resulting in total cash available for the USAuto acquisition of $108.3 million.
Of this amount, $76.0 million was paid for the purchase of USAuto, $2.9 million
was used to reduce USAuto's debt, and $3.1 million was paid for costs related to
the acquisition. After the acquisition, the Company contributed $5.0 million to
the statutory capital and surplus of its two insurance subsidiaries, USAuto
Insurance Company Inc. and Village Auto Insurance Company Inc., to support
additional premium writings. The remaining net unrestricted cash of $21.3
million is available for general corporate purposes and to provide support for
increased premium writings of the insurance operations.

         Proceeds from the Company's rights offering and cash flows from
insurance operations for the two months ended June 30, 2004 have contributed to
higher invested assets. On July 1, 2004, the Company engaged Hyperion Capital
Management, Inc. to manage its insurance and corporate investment portfolios,
which total approximately $60 million in investable assets.

ABOUT FIRST ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION

         First Acceptance Corporation began its operations as Liberte Investors,
Inc. in 1986. Its insurance subsidiary, USAuto, which began operations in 1995,
provides non-standard private passenger automobile insurance primarily through
employee-agents in 146 retail offices in seven states. The Company's insurance
company subsidiaries are licensed to do business in 22 states.

(1)      Actual results reflect USAuto's insurance operations since the date of
         acquisition (April 30, 2004).

(2)      Pro forma results give effect to the USAuto acquisition and related
         transactions, including the rights offering and the application of the
         proceeds therefrom, as if they had been consummated on July 1, 2002.
         The pro forma results also give effect to the elimination of certain
         expenses that have been discontinued directly as a result of the
         acquisition, such as the compensation expense of terminated employees.
