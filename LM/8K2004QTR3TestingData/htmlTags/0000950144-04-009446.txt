          OXFORD INDUSTRIES ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 2005 RESULTS
      REITERATES COMFORT WITH FULL-YEAR EARNINGS GUIDANCE OF $2.70 TO $2.85
          FIRST QUARTER EPS OF $0.36 INCLUDES $0.13 OF NON-CASH CHARGES
            TOMMY BAHAMA AND BEN SHERMAN SEE CONTINUED STRONG RESULTS

ATLANTA, GA. - Oxford Industries, Inc. (NYSE:OXM) announced today financial
results for the first quarter ended August 27, 2004. The Company reported that,
for the quarter, net sales increased 9% to $265 million from $242 million in the
first quarter of fiscal 2004.

Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter decreased to $0.36 from $0.42
in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. The Company noted that earnings per share
were affected by the write-off of $1.8 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, in
deferred financing fees to amend its revolving credit agreement. The Company's
most recent guidance assumed this charge would be approximately $0.05 per share.
Additionally, the Company noted that $0.06 per share of non-cash intangible
asset amortization costs associated with the Tommy Bahama and Ben Sherman
acquisitions were included in operating expenses in the first quarter.

J. Hicks Lanier, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Oxford Industries,
Inc., commented, "While the challenging retail environment had an impact on
results in our historical businesses, we were very pleased with the performance
of our branded businesses and continue to be optimistic with respect to our
full-year outlook. Tommy Bahama continues to be very well received by the
markets and to have excellent opportunities for continued growth. The Ben
Sherman business, which was added to our Menswear Group following its
acquisition on July 30th, delivered strong results for the quarter, particularly
in its US operations. We believe that Ben Sherman, along with Tommy Bahama, will
continue to fuel our results as we go forward."

The Tommy Bahama Group contributed $93.5 million in sales in the first quarter,
an increase of 48% over last year when results from its operations were included
for an eleven week period. Sales growth resulted from increased wholesale
penetration and revenues from eleven more retail stores than were open during
the year-ago quarter. Operating income for this segment was $11.9 million for
the quarter, an increase of 71% over the eleven-week first quarter last year.

The Menswear Group reported first quarter sales of $118.7 million compared to
sales of $115.8 million last year. Ben Sherman, which was included for only one
month during the first quarter following its July 30th acquisition, contributed
approximately $17 million in sales. The Company noted that last year's first
quarter included the last of the initial fixture fill of Lands' End product for
Sears retail stores and the last remnants of the discontinued Izod Club Golf
business, neither of which anniversaried this year. First quarter operating
income in this segment was $8.9 million, a decrease of 6% from the same period
last year. The decline in profitability was the result of de-leveraging on a
sales decline in its historical business, which was partially offset by higher
operating profitability in the recently acquired Ben Sherman business.

First quarter sales for the Womenswear Group declined to $52.5 million from
$63.0 million last year. The Company attributed the sales decline to continued
lower shipments of women's apparel to WalMart, whose sales in this product
category have been sluggish for the past several months. Lower than expected
comparable store sales trends at several major customers led to the deferral of
some orders from the first quarter. Continuing margin pressure and the sales
shortfall resulted in an operating loss of $1.0 million for the first quarter
compared to operating income of $3.2 million in the year ago quarter.

The Company commented that, despite some near term challenges in its historical
business, it continues to be comfortable with a full year range of diluted
earnings per share of $2.70 to $2.85 on sales of approximately $1.285 billion to
$1.325 billion.

For the second quarter, ending on November 26, 2004, the Company continues to
anticipate sales in a range from $305 million to $315 million and earnings per
share of $0.48 to $0.52.

Mr. Lanier continued, "We have a variety of strong opportunities for growth
during the remainder of the year and believe that we are positioned for a strong
second half. We expect to deliver record financial results for the year driven
by the contributions of Tommy Bahama and Ben Sherman and supported by new
initiatives in a number of our historical businesses. We look forward to
continuing to deliver superior returns and drive value to our shareholders."

The Company will hold a conference call with senior management to discuss the
financial results at 4:30 p.m. ET today. A live Webcast of the conference call
will be available on the Company's Web site at www.oxfordinc.com. Please visit
