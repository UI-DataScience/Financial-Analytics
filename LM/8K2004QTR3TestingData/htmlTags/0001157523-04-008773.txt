(a) As previously announced, Jaco Electronics reported on September 21
    that it sold its contract manufacturing subsidiary, Nexus Custom
    Electronics, Inc. As a result, the operations of Nexus Custom
    Electronics are classified as discontinued as of July 1, 2003 (the
    beginning of Jaco's 2004 fiscal year).

     Commenting on the results, Jaco's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
Joel Girsky, stated, "We achieved an 11% rise in net sales during the fiscal
2004 fourth quarter and a strong improvement in gross margins during the period.
The fiscal fourth quarter gross profit margins reflect both favorable market
conditions and a higher margin product mix. During fiscal 2004, sales from our
core semiconductor offerings represented approximately 53% of Jaco's net sales
while flat panel display (FPD) sales grew from 10% of total net sales in fiscal
2003, to 21% in fiscal 2004. Our FPD sales rose over 150% in fiscal 2004 to
$51.8 million.
     "In anticipation of the continued explosive growth of our FPD unit, we
accelerated the sale of our non-core contract manufacturing subsidiary, Nexus
Custom Electronics, announced last week. Under the sale agreement, we remain a
key electronic components supplier to Nexus for a minimum five-year period. Of
equal importance, we received $9.25 million of sales proceeds in cash with $2.75
million scheduled and yet to be received, as well as an extra $1 million
earn-out provision. With these sales proceeds, we will initially pay down our
bank line, which was already reduced by $1.9 million from the level at the end
of our fiscal third quarter.
     "We continue to enhance our ability to design, integrate and customize
unique flat panel displays for a broad range of industries and applications
including electronic voting machines, the gaming and transportation industries,
and touch-screen applications for the fast food industry. We plan to vertically
integrate our FPD capabilities and will start construction shortly on an
in-house, state-of-the-art, 20,000 square foot FPD operation. When completed, we
will offer customers a one-stop source for their FPD supply and integration
needs. We believe the 'value-add' component of our FPD operation, which includes
design, engineering and integration capabilities, is a competitive advantage,
and we intend to leverage both our broad line card and in-depth experience to
expand Jaco's market share.
     "Looking ahead, we plan to accelerate our investment in the Far East, and
may explore distribution-related acquisitions in that region that meet our
disciplined criteria. With the Nexus divestiture, Jaco is now a pure-play,
vertically integrated designer and distributor of FPD products and a distributor
of a wide range of electronic components with a broad national presence and
expanding international capabilities. We remain focused on bottom-line results
and the realization of the full potential from our focused operating base."
     Jaco is a leading distributor of electronic components to industrial OEMs
and contract manufacturers. Jaco distributes products such as semiconductors,
capacitors, resistors, electromechanical devices, flat panel displays and power
supplies, which are used in the manufacture and assembly of electronic products,
including: telecommunications equipment, computers and office equipment, medical
devices and instrumentation, industrial equipment and controls,
military/aerospace systems and automotive and consumer electronics.
     Jaco has two distribution centers and 16 strategically located sales
offices throughout the United States. Jaco provides a variety of value-added
services including automated inventory management services, assembling stock
items for customers into pre-packaged kits, integrating and assembling various
custom components with flat panel displays to customer specifications. The
Company's core customer base consists primarily of small and medium-sized
manufacturers that produce electronic equipment used in a wide variety of
industries.

     "Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995: This press release provides historical information and includes
forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and
uncertainties, including, but not limited to, our dependence on a limited number
of distributors for our products, that most of our distributor agreements are
cancelable upon short notice, the impact of downturns in our industry and the
general economy, the market for our products is very competitive, the impact of
disruptions in air or sea transportation and possible future legislative or
regulatory changes on our business, volatility in electronic components' pricing
may reduce our profit margins, the level of costs or difficulties incurred in
connection with integrating the operations of businesses we acquire, the
financial strength of our customers and suppliers, and other risks disclosed
from time to time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The
forward-looking statements in this press release involve assumptions, risks and
uncertainties that could cause our actual results or performance, including
margins, SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues and earnings per diluted
share, to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking
statements. We believe that all forward-looking statements made by us have a
reasonable basis, but we cannot assure you that management's expectations,
beliefs or projections as expressed in the forward-looking statements will
actually occur or prove to be correct. As a result, our actual results may
differ materially from the information set forth herein.
