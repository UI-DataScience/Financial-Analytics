FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

                COUNTRYWIDE REPORTS AUGUST 2004 OPERATIONAL DATA
                  - SERVICING PORTFOLIO REACHES $765 BILLION -
        - PIPELINE OF APPLICATIONS-IN-PROCESS INCREASES TO $50 BILLION -
                     - AUGUST FUNDINGS RISE TO $31 BILLION -

CALABASAS, CA (September 10, 2004) - Countrywide Financial Corporation (NYSE:
CFC), a diversified financial services provider, released operational data for
the month ended August 31, 2004. Highlights included the following:

      -     Loan fundings were $31 billion for the month, an increase of 5
            percent from the prior month. This represents a 24 percent decline
            from August 2003 as a result of a substantially lower level of
            industry-wide refinance activity. Year-to-date funding volume now
            totals $237 billion.

      -     Monthly purchase activity rose for the sixth consecutive month to
            $18 billion, an increase of 1 percent over last month and 42 percent
            more than August 2003. Year-to-date purchase volume now stands at
            $113 billion, approaching 2003's full year level of $130 billion.

      -     Demand for adjustable-rate, home equity and subprime loans remained
            robust.

            -     Adjustable-rate fundings reached a record $18 billion, 83
                  percent greater than August 2003, and accounted for 59 percent
                  of total monthly loan volume. Adjustable-rate volume grew by 7
                  percent over July 2004, driving year-to-date volume to $118
                  billion.

            -     Home equity fundings reached a new monthly record of $3.1
                  billion, 8 percent more than the previous month and 80 percent
                  higher than August 2003. Year-to-date home equity production
                  surpassed $18 billion, and exceeded the volume achieved in
                  calendar 2003.

            -     Subprime volume grew for the month to $4.3 billion, advancing
                  13 percent from last month and increasing 158 percent over
                  August 2003. Year-to-date subprime volume totaled $25 billion,
                  exceeding total subprime volume produced in calendar 2003.

      -     The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield declined during the month of August
            2004, as compared to a rising trend in August 2003. As a result,
            average daily application activity during August 2004 rose by 2
            percent over July 2004 and was 13 percent more than August 2003. And
            while the pipeline of applications-in-process at August 31, 2004 was
            down 7 percent from August 31, 2003, it was 4 percent greater than
            July 2004.

      -     The servicing portfolio reached $765 billion for the month,
            surpassing the August 2003 level by $173 billion, or 29 percent, and
            has increased by $120 billion since the beginning of 2004.

      -     August securities trading volume of $241 billion decreased by 6
            percent from the level achieved in August 2003 primarily due to
            lower mortgage origination activity industry-wide. Year-to-date
            trading volume totaled $2.1 trillion, 2 percent greater than the
            $2.0 trillion achieved for the same 8-month period of 2003.

      -     Total assets at Countrywide Bank rose to $31 billion, 8 percent
            higher than July 2004 and double the level of August 2003.

      -     Net earned premiums at Balboa were $64 million, down 3 percent from
            August 2003 as a result of lower activity in Balboa Life & Casualty,
            and year-to-date reached $514 million.

      -     Sub-servicing volume at Global Home Loans totaled $109 billion, a 17
            percent increase from August 2003.

"Countrywide's well-balanced business model continues to produce strong
operational results amidst a transitional environment," said Stanford L.
Kurland, President and Chief Operating Officer. "Compared to a year ago, the
total mortgage origination market is smaller as a result of lower refinance
volume. This impact has been mitigated by Countrywide's dramatic growth in
purchase fundings and record volumes of adjustable-rate, home equity and
subprime loans. On the servicing side, our portfolio grew $18 billion from July
2004 to reach a new high of $765 billion, as we set our sights on becoming the
industry's #1 servicer. The Company's servicing portfolio has grown 19 percent
since the beginning of the year and 29 percent over the last twelve months.
Countrywide's diversification efforts were led by Countrywide Bank. The Bank's
assets have doubled over the last year to $31 billion, on track with our growth
plan."
