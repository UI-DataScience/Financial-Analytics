                                  Contact: Christopher J. Walls, General Counsel
                                  OptiCare Health Systems, Inc.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

      OPTICARE RESTATES ITS 2002 AND 2003 AND FIRST QUARTER 2004 FINANCIAL
         STATEMENTS, FILES ITS FORM 10-Q FOR THE SECOND QUARTER 2004 AND
                  REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2004 FINANCIAL RESULTS

WATERBURY, Conn., September 2, 2004 -- OptiCare Health Systems, Inc. (Amex: OPT)
announced today that it has completed its previously announced review of its
classification of long term debt in its previously reported financial statements
for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003 and its previously announced
review of its accounting for inventory during the quarter ended March 31, 2004
and has restated its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002
and 2003 and for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. The company also filed its
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2004.

In connection with the restatement of its 2002 and 2003 financial statements,
the company reclassified approximately $9.7 million and approximately $1.6
million owed under its loan agreement with its senior lender as of December 31,
2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively, from a long term liability to a
current liability. The restated financial statements reported current portions
of long-term debt of approximately $10.8 million and approximately $2.8 million
as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively, and long term debt
of approximately $1.8 million and approximately $1.0 million as of December 31,
2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. The company concluded that the amounts
outstanding pursuant to certain provisions contained in the credit facility
should have been classified as current liabilities rather than long-term debt,
pursuant to the provisions of consensus 95-22 issued by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board's Emerging Issues Task Force. There was no change in the net
income or loss available to common stockholders as originally reported for such
periods as a result of this restatement.

In connection with the restatement of its first quarter 2004 financial
statements, the company determined that at March 31, 2004 its inventory was
overstated by approximately $0.7 million and an inventory liability was
understated by approximately $0.3 million. The effect of these changes resulted
in an approximate $0.2 million reduction to revenue and an approximate $0.8
million increase to cost of goods sold, which resulted in a net income reduction
of approximately

<PAGE>

$1.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. As a result, the restated
financial statements reported a net loss to common stockholders for the quarter
ended March 31, 2004 of approximately $1.1 million opposed to approximately $0.2
million as originally reported and net loss per common share for the quarter
ended March 31, 2004 of $0.04 opposed to $0.01 as originally reported. The
company concluded that the overstatement of inventory resulted primarily from
mathematical errors in the calculation of inventory.

The company also announced today that it reported total net revenues for the six
months ended June 30, 2004 of approximately $60.3 million, down from
approximately $63.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003 and total net
revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2004 of approximately $30.8
million, down from approximately $32.0 million for the three months ended June
30, 2003. The company also reported loss from continuing operations for the six
months ended June 30, 2004 of approximately $1.0 million, down from
approximately $2.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003; loss from
continuing operations for the three months ended June 30, 2004 of approximately
$0.1 million, down from approximately $2.2 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2003; net loss to common stockholders for the six months ended June 30,
2004 of approximately $2.3 million, which is equal to the net loss to common
stockholders of approximately $2.3 million for the six months ended June 30,
2003; and net loss to common stockholders for the three months ended June 30,
2004 of approximately $1.1 million, down from approximately $2.3 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2003.

Additionally, the company stated that on August 27, 2004, the company amended
the terms of its loan agreement with its senior lender to remove the condition
precedent that there is no material adverse effect or material adverse change
with respect to the company from the lender's obligation to advance funds to the
company and to remove the occurrence of a material adverse effect or material
adverse change with respect to the company from the definition of events of
default under the loan agreement. In connection with this amendment, the
company's major stockholder, Palisade Concentrated Equity Partnership, L.P.,
guaranteed an additional $1,000,000 of the company's obligations under the loan
agreement.
