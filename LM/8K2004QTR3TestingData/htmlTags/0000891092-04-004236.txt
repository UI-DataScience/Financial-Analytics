    Nordson Corporation Announces Record Third-Quarter Sales, Net Income And
                  Earnings Per Share; EPS Increases 81 Percent

    WESTLAKE, Ohio, Aug. 25 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Nordson Corporation
(Nasdaq: NDSN) today announced record sales, net income and earnings per share
for its third quarter, which ended August 1, 2004.  Net income grew to
$17.3 million, which nearly doubles the $8.7 million earned in the prior year.
Diluted earnings per share were $.47 compared with $.26 for the third quarter
of 2003, an increase of 81 percent.
    Worldwide sales for the third quarter reached a record $198 million, a
19 percent increase over sales of $166 million for the same period of 2003.
Volume gains were 16 percent, with the remainder of the increase traced to
currency effects associated with a weaker U.S. dollar.
    Third-quarter sales volume for the company's advanced technology segment
grew 26 percent, the finishing segment increased 14 percent, and the adhesive
dispensing segment climbed 13 percent.
    On a geographic basis, third-quarter volume was up 9 percent in the United
States, 46 percent in the Americas, 13 percent in Europe, 7 percent in Japan
and 40 percent in the Asia-Pacific region.
    Backlog at the end of the third quarter was approximately $115 million, up
$48 million from the beginning of the fiscal year calculated at constant
exchange rates.
    For the first three quarters of 2004, sales were $565 million, an
18 percent increase over the same period of the prior year.  Sales volume
increased 12 percent with favorable currency effects accounting for the
balance.  Earnings per share on a diluted basis were $1.20, also a record,
compared with $.65 for the same period last year.
    "The acceleration of business activity in our adhesive and finishing
businesses, combined with the continued strength in our advanced technology
sectors resulted in double-digit sales growth across all segments in the third
quarter.  These factors, combined with expanding margins, produced an
exceptional bottom-line for the period," said Edward P. Campbell, chairman and
chief executive officer.  "We are encouraged by this trend and look forward to
the fourth quarter being another period of record revenue and excellent
bottom-line results," he added.

    Nordson will broadcast its third-quarter conference call on the investor
relations page of the company's Web site, www.nordson.com , on Wednesday,
August 25, 2004, at 2:00 p.m. EDT.  For persons unable to listen to the live
