ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

         In accordance with General Instruction B.2. of Form 8-K, the following
information and the exhibits referenced therein is being furnished pursuant to
Item 2.02 of Form 8-K and is not deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is not subject to the
liabilities of that section and is not deemed incorporated by reference in any
filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended.

         On February 11, 2004, Webster County Coal, LLC's ("Webster County
Coal") Dotiki mine was temporarily idled for a period of twenty-seven calendar
days following the occurrence of a mine fire that originated with a diesel
supply tractor (the "Dotiki Fire Incident"). As a result of the firefighting
efforts of the Mine Safety and Health Administration, the Kentucky Department of
Mines and Minerals, and Webster County Coal personnel, Dotiki successfully
extinguished the fire and totally isolated the affected area of the mine behind
permanent barriers. Initial production resumed on March 8, 2004. As previously
advised, Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. (the "Partnership") has commercial
property insurance that provides coverage for damage to property destroyed,
interruption of business operations, including profit recovery, and expenditures
incurred to minimize the period and total cost of disruption to operations.

         On September 10, 2004, the Partnership filed a third and final proof of
loss with the applicable insurance underwriters reflecting a settlement (the
"Settlement") of all expenses, losses and claims incurred by Webster County Coal
and other affiliates arising from or in connection with the Dotiki Fire Incident
(the "Insurance Claim") in the aggregate amount of $27.0 million, inclusive of a
$1.0 million self-retention, a $2.5 million deductible (collectively, the
"Insurance Deductibles") and 10% co-insurance (the "Co-Insurance"). The
Insurance Deductibles and Co-Insurance have been allocated on a pro-rata basis
to each of the three areas of insurance recoveries discussed below. Previously,
Webster County Coal had received two partial advance payments of $4.5 million
and $3.6 million, respectively, net of the Insurance Deductibles and
Co-Insurance. The accounting for these two net partial advance payments in the
aggregate amount of $8.1 million and the final net payment of $13.05 million,
exclusive of the Insurance Deductible and Co-Insurance, are subject to the
accounting methodology described below. Specifically, the Partnership has
evaluated and accounted for the insurance recoveries in the following areas:

         1.       Expenses incurred as a result of the fire - The Partnership
                  incurred extra expenses, expediting expenses, and other costs
                  associated with extinguishing the fire in an aggregate amount
                  of approximately $7.1 million. With application of $5.6
                  million of the insurance recovery proceeds, the Partnership
                  has recorded net expenses of approximately $1.5 million.

         2.       Damage to Dotiki mine property - The Partnership incurred
                  damage to Dotiki's mine property (exclusive of any amounts
                  relating to matters discussed in 1. above) of approximately
                  $1.2 million, which property had a net book value of



                                       2
<PAGE>

                  $138,000. This net book amount was written off in the first
                  quarter of 2004, and a corresponding amount was recorded in
                  the first quarter of 2004 as an estimated insurance recovery.
                  Based on discussions with the underwriters culminating in the
                  Settlement, the Partnership will also record a net gain of
                  approximately $785,000, reflecting the amount that the
                  allocated insurance proceeds will exceed the net book value of
                  the damaged property.

         3.       Dotiki mine business interruption costs and extra expense -
                  Based on the negotiations with the underwriters leading to the
                  Settlement, the Partnership has recorded a net gain of
                  approximately $14.4 million for the recovery of business
                  interruption costs and extra expenses stemming from the Dotiki
                  Fire Incident.

         Pursuant to the accounting methodology described above, the Partnership
(a) has recorded, as an offset to operating expenses, approximately $2.9
million, $0.2 million, and $2.8 million, during the first, second, and third
quarters of 2004, respectively, and (b) in the third quarter of 2004, has
recorded a combined net gain of approximately $15.2 million for damage to
property destroyed, interruption of business operations (including profit
recovery), and extra expenses incurred to minimize the period and total cost of
disruption to operations.

         On September 13, 2004, the Partnership announced via press release the
final settlement of the Insurance Claim. A copy of the Partnership's press
release is hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

ALLIANCE RESOURCE PARTNERS, L.P.
REPORTS SETTLEMENT OF DOTIKI MINE FIRE INSURANCE CLAIM; AND RAISES 2004 GUIDANCE

TULSA, Oklahoma, September 13, 2004 - Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ:
ARLP) today reported that a final settlement has been concluded with its
insurance underwriters concerning the expenses and losses attributable to the
mine fire that occurred earlier this year at the Partnership's Dotiki mine,
operated by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Webster County Coal, LLC. (See ARLP
Press Releases, dated February 12, March 1, March 8, March 25, April 23 and July
22, 2004.)

The settlement covers all expenses, losses and claims incurred by Webster County
Coal and other affiliates in an aggregate amount of $27.0 million. This
settlement amount provides for reimbursement of expenses and costs associated
with extinguishing the fire, damage to Dotiki mine property, interruption of
business operations (including profit recovery) and extra expenses incurred to
minimize the impact to the Partnership's operations stemming from the Dotiki
mine fire. The net settlement amount of approximately $21.1 million reflects a
$1.0 million self-retention amount, a $2.5 million deductible, and 10%
co-insurance of approximately $2.4 million. The Partnership has previously
received $8.1 million as partial advance payments of this settlement amount and
expects to receive the final net payment of approximately $13.0 million in early
October, 2004.

"I am extremely pleased that we were able to reach an equitable and expedited
resolution of the Dotiki mine fire insurance claim," said Joseph W. Craft III,
President and Chief Executive Officer. "Through the dedicated efforts of
everyone involved, from the initial firefighting efforts to resolution of the
insurance claim itself, this settlement allows us to put the fire incident
behind us and focus on Dotiki's continuing bright future."

As previously reported, the Partnership recorded an offset to operating
expenses, as a recovery under its commercial insurance policies, of
approximately $2.9 million and $0.2 million in the first and second quarters of
2004, respectively. With the completion of the final settlement in the third
quarter of 2004, the Partnership will record an additional offset to operating
expenses of approximately $2.8 million and a gain of approximately $15.2 million
attributable to property damage, interruption of business operations (including
profit recovery), and extra expenses incurred to minimize the period and total
cost of disruption to the Partnership's operations as a result of the Dotiki
mine fire.

As a result of the $18 million impact of the final insurance settlement, the
limited partners' interest in net income for the third quarter of 2004 will
increase by approximately $17.6 million or $0.98 and $0.96 per basic and diluted
limited partner unit, respectively. In addition, the Partnership is



                                     -MORE-

increasing its estimate of net income for the year ending December 31, 2004 from
a range of $70.0 to $80.0 million to a range of $88.0 to $98.0 million.

Alliance Resource Partners is the nation's only publicly traded master limited
partnership involved in the production and marketing of coal. Alliance Resource
Partners currently operates mining complexes in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and
Maryland.
