            California Pizza Kitchen Reports Third Quarter
        Eighteen Month Comparable Store Sales Increase Of 8.7%

   Excluding Expected One-time Charges, Management Raises Guidance
               to $0.25 - $0.26 Per Fully Diluted Share

    LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 27, 2004--California Pizza Kitchen, Inc.
(Nasdaq:CPKI) announced today that revenues were approximately $106.1 million
for the third quarter ended September 26, 2004 versus $93.1 million in the third
quarter of 2003. Eighteen month comparable restaurant sales increased
approximately 8.7% compared to 2.8% in the third quarter a year ago. Twelve
month comparable sales increased 7.5% and 2.0% for the third quarter of 2004 and
2003, respectively.
    On its July 22, 2004 conference call, the Company forecasted an eighteen
month third quarter same store sales increase of approximately 4.5% to 5.5% with
a corresponding earnings per fully diluted share in the range of $0.22- $0.24.
In line with previously announced comments, however, several one-time charges
will be incurred during the quarter relating to three store closures, costs
associated with anticipated legal resolutions and accelerated depreciation for
store remodel candidates. The exact scope of these one-time charges will be
determined in the coming weeks and will be discussed at length on California
Pizza Kitchen Inc.'s upcoming third quarter conference call. Excluding these
charges, however, management is now comfortable increasing its earnings guidance
from continuing operations to $0.25 - $0.26 per fully diluted share.
    The Company intends to release its third quarter earnings on October 21,
2004 at approximately 4:00 p.m. EDT with a conference call to follow at
approximately 5:00 p.m. EDT. Management will specifically address full year and
fourth quarter guidance at that time. A webcast of the conference call can be
accessed at www.cpk.com.
