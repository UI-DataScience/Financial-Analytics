SECTION 2 - FINANCIAL INFORMATION

ITEM 2.02.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

            On August 31, 2004, the Registrant issued a press release announcing
its results for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2004. A copy of such press release
is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.

            The information being furnished hereunder discloses EBITDA (earnings
(loss) before interest (including preferred dividends), taxes, depreciation
(including impairments) and amortization), a non-GAAP financial measure within
the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The Registrant believes that EBITDA is a useful measure of
evaluating its financial performance because of its focus on the Registrant's
results from operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization. EBITDA is utilized for internal analysis of the Registrant. EBITDA
is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") and should not be considered in isolation or as an
alternative to other financial measures determined under GAAP. However, EBITDA
is commonly used by investors, financial analysts and rating agencies as an
alternative measure of evaluating, comparing and rating operating performance.
EBITDA presented by the Registrant may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures reported by other companies.

            The information in this Form 8-K, including exhibits, is being
furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of this report and shall not be deemed "filed"
for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it
be incorporated by reference into any registration statement filed by the
Registrant under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless specifically
identified therein as being incorporated therein by reference.



SECTION 9 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS

ITEM 9.01.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.

            (c)  Exhibits.

                 99.1       Press Release dated August 31, 2004.




                                   SIGNATURES
                                   ----------

            Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the
undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

PALWEB REPORTS RESULTS FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDING 2004
Tuesday August 31, 9:41 am ET

TULSA, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 31, 2004--PalWeb Corporation (OTCBB:PLWB -
News) announced today that its sales increased to $6,964,943 for fiscal year
ending May 31, 2004 compared to $1,280,945 for fiscal year 2003 for an increase
of $5,683,998, representing an increase of 443%. PalWeb also reported a net loss
to common shareholders for the year ended May 31, 2004 of ($3,121,098), or
($0.28) per share, versus ($4,115,018), or ($0.79) per share, for the same
period last year after deducting dividends to preferred shareholders of $660,171
in 2004 and $900,166 in 2003. PalWeb's EBITDA (earnings (loss) before interest
(including preferred dividends), taxes, depreciation (including impairments) and
amortization) for the year ended May 31, 2004 is ($1,128,505) versus
($2,239,427) for the same period last year. The EBITDA for fiscal 2004 includes
one-time relocation costs of $222,196.

"We are focusing on establishing our physical capacities to meet expected demand
and bringing operating costs inline with company established goals," said Warren
Kruger, President and CEO of PalWeb Corporation. "The bulk of our increase in
sales during 2004 was a result of the acquisition of Greystone and increased
orders from our existing customer base. The acquisition of Greystone Plastics
and the production consolidation into our Iowa plant will contribute to our
efforts while expanding the Company's product line to meet new inquiries for our
unique line of recycled plastic pallets, including significant requests for
pallets by global corporations."

measure within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission. A reconciliation of EBITDA to net income (loss) available
to common shareholders before income taxes, the most directly comparable GAAP
financial measure, as well as additional information concerning EBITDA, are
included at the end of this release.

Forward-Looking Statements

This press release includes certain statements that may be deemed
"forward-looking statements" within the meaning of federal securities laws. All
statements, other than statements of historical facts, that address activities,
events or developments that PalWeb expects, believes or anticipates will or may
occur in the future, including decreased costs, the profitability of PalWeb,
potential sales of pallets or other possible business developments, are
forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to a number of
assumptions, risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements above could
be affected by any of the following factors: PalWeb's prospects could be
affected by changes in availability of raw materials, competition, rapid
