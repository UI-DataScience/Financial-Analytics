                 SMSC REPORTS SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2005 RESULTS

Hauppauge,  NY - September 20, 2004 - SMSC (Nasdaq:  SMSC) today  announced that
revenues for the second  quarter  ended August 31, 2004 were $50.2  million,  in
line with the Company's estimate announced on August 17, 2004, and approximately
4% higher than revenues of $48.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004.

Gross profit  percentage on total  revenues was 47.6% for the second  quarter of
fiscal 2005,  compared to 44.5% in the previous  year's  second  quarter.  Gross
profit  percentage on product  sales was 44.4% in this year's second  quarter as
compared to 44.2% a year ago.

Research and  development  expenses for the second  quarter were $11.2  million,
compared to $9.3  million in the  year-ago  quarter,  and  selling,  general and
administrative  expenses were $11.9  million,  compared to $10.0 million in last
year's  second  quarter.  The  year-over-year  increases in  operating  expenses
primarily reflect  investments in engineering and marketing personnel to support
future  revenue  growth,  litigation  costs and  tooling  costs for new  product
developments.

Operating  income in the  second  quarter  of fiscal  2005 was $0.6  million  as
compared to $1.9 million in the year-ago  period.  Second quarter net income was
$0.9 million, or $0.05 per share,  compared to $1.5 million, or $0.08 per share,
in the second quarter of fiscal 2004.

Cash and liquid investments at August 31, 2004 were $182.0 million,  an increase
of $12.3 million from $169.7 million at May 31, 2004. Tax refunds  totaling $6.9
million  contributed  to the  increase  in cash and  liquid  investments  in the
quarter.  Inventories  at August  31,  2004  totaled  $27.8  million  and remain
appropriate  relative to expected demand. The Company has no bank debt, and book
value per share was $14.47 as of August 31, 2004.

"As announced on August 17th,  SMSC's second quarter  revenues were below normal
seasonal  patterns  resulting  from a  general  slowdown  in orders  across  our
businesses,   particularly  in  PC  I/O  products,  as  ODMs  rebalanced  excess
inventories,"  said Steven J. Bilodeau,  Chairman and Chief  Executive  Officer.
"However,  based on current  customer  demand,  we expect third quarter  product
revenues to show sequential growth."

Mr. Bilodeau added,  "Looking at second quarter revenues  compared to last year,
networking and connectivity products produced strong growth of over 50% and 80%,
respectively.  In addition,  non-PC I/O revenues contributed 41% of total second
quarter  product sales, as SMSC continues to execute on its goal of diversifying
its product portfolio.

"During the second quarter,  SMSC introduced two 'industry  first' products with
its USB2.0 2-port hub for portable and integrated  applications,  as well as its
suite of integrated industrial-temperature embedded I/O controllers. Also, early
in September,  SMSC announced a comprehensive  line of USB2.0 hubs,  USB2.0 card
reader,  USB2.0 PHY,  mobile super I/O and embedded  ethernet  controllers for a
wide range of consumer and commercial connectivity solutions.  Our commitment to
driving product innovation,  as evidenced in these recent introductions,  should
serve  us well in our  diversification  goal as we  target  a  broader  range of
markets."

Business Outlook:

For the third  quarter of fiscal 2005,  SMSC expects  revenues to be between $54
million  and $57  million,  representing  a  sequential  increase in revenues of
approximately  11%, at the midpoint of that range.  Gross profit  percentage  is
expected to be between 45% and 46%,  reflective  of product mix and a slowing of
cost reductions due to tightened  supply  constraints.  Research and development
expenses  are  expected  to be between  $10.5  million  and $11.5  million,  and
selling,  general and  administrative  expenses  are  expected to be between $11
million and $12 million.  Amortization of acquired intangibles is expected to be
approximately  $0.3  million.  Due  to  higher  interest  income  caused  by the
increased  cash  balance  and a change  in the mix of  taxable  and  non-taxable
investments,  interest income is expected to be approximately $0.7 million.  The
effective  tax rate is  estimated  to be between  26% and 27%,  and the  Company
expects third quarter net income to be between $0.10 and $0.14 per share.

Forward Looking Statements:

Except for historical  information  contained  herein,  the matters discussed in
this  announcement are  forward-looking  statements about expected future events
and financial and operating results that involve risks and uncertainties.  These
include the timely development and market acceptance of new products; the impact
of competitive  products and pricing; the effect of changing economic conditions
in domestic  and  international  markets;  changes in customer  order  patterns,
including loss of key customers,  order  cancellations or reduced bookings;  and
excess or obsolete  inventory  and  variations  in  inventory  valuation,  among
others.  Such  statements  are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks
and  uncertainties  surrounding  future  expectations  and may not  reflect  the
potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers or divestitures.

SMSC  competes  in the  semiconductor  industry,  which  has  historically  been
characterized  by intense  competition,  rapid  technological  change,  cyclical
market patterns,  price erosion and periods of mismatched  supply and demand. In
addition,  sales of many of the Company's  products  depend  largely on sales of
personal computers and peripheral devices,  and reductions in the rate of growth
of the PC, consumer  electronics and embedded markets could adversely affect its
operating  results.  SMSC  conducts  business  outside the United  States and is
subject to tariff and import  regulations and currency  fluctuations,  which may
have an effect on its business. All forward-looking  statements speak only as of
the date  hereof and are based upon the  information  available  to SMSC at this
time. Such information is subject to change, and the Company may not necessarily
inform,  or be required to inform,  investors of such  changes.  These and other
risks and uncertainties, including potential liability resulting from pending or
future litigation, are detailed from time to time in the Company's reports filed
with the SEC.  Investors are advised to read the Company's Annual Report on Form
10-K and quarterly  reports on Form 10-Q filed with the  Securities and Exchange
Commission,  particularly those sections entitled "Other Factors That May Affect
Future  Operating  Results" for a more  complete  discussion  of these and other
risks and uncertainties.
