           Steelcase Reports Second Quarter Profit of $0.05 Per Share

    GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 23, 2004--Steelcase
Inc. (NYSE:SCS) today reported revenue totaling $651.0 million for its
second quarter ended August 27, 2004. Revenue for this quarter
increased 6.4 percent compared to $612.1 million in the prior year
quarter and was up 8.9 percent sequentially from the first quarter of
fiscal 2005. Revenue was in line with company estimates.
    Revenue included $21.0 million of sales from dealers consolidated
in fiscal 2005 and $8.3 million from the impact of the steel surcharge
implemented in North America during the first quarter. The second
quarter also benefited by $8.6 million from favorable currency
translation effects in the company's International segment compared to
last year.
    Steelcase reported net income of $7.3 million, or $0.05 per share,
for the second quarter of fiscal 2005, better than company estimates
of breakeven to $(0.05) per share. This compares to a net loss from
continuing operations of $(3.2) million, or $(0.02) per share in the
same quarter of the prior year. Prior year net income of $18.1 million
included a $21.3 million after-tax gain on discontinued operations
related to the sale of Attwood.
    Reported results included net restructuring charges totaling
$(1.4) million after-tax. These charges were favorable compared to
company estimates of $(3) to (7) million because of lower than
anticipated restructuring charges for activities completed during the
quarter, and a change in timing for other restructuring activities
from the second quarter to the second half of the year.
    The company improved gross margins by 2.6 percentage points to
30.0 percent compared to 27.4 percent in the same quarter last year.
Productivity gains, benefits of previous restructuring activities,
reduced restructuring costs and continued cost containment contributed
to better-than-expected gross margin performance.
    Steelcase also reduced operating expenses as a percent of sales to
27.3 percent from 27.7 percent in the prior year and 28.6 percent in
the first quarter. This improvement was related to continued cost
control, higher sales volume and, because some project spending
originally expected during the second quarter has shifted to the
second half of the year. Operating expenses increased in absolute
dollars compared to the prior year, because of newly consolidated
dealers, increased variable compensation accruals, and unfavorable
currency translation effects.
    All business segments improved profitability in the quarter
compared to the prior year. Steelcase reported net income of $1.6
million year-to-date.
    "I am pleased with the profitable growth the Steelcase team
delivered this quarter," said James P. Hackett, president and CEO. "We
are seeing benefits from our multi-year restructuring effort, improved
productivity from lean manufacturing initiatives, and top-line growth
from our larger customers and in key vertical markets."
    Steelcase increased cash balances by $34.2 million and lowered
debt by $2.2 million compared to the first quarter. Higher net income
and improved net working capital performance generated operating cash
flow in the second quarter.
    "Steelcase returned to profitability this quarter through
improvements in gross margins as well as continued operating expense
control," said James P. Keane, chief financial officer. "Because of
the sustained efforts of Steelcase employees, we delivered our highest
level of income from continuing operations in six quarters. At the
same time, we strengthened our balance sheet by increasing cash and
reducing debt during the quarter."

    Outlook

    North American order rates continue to increase, but at a slower
rate than the company experienced earlier in the year. This is
consistent with indications that the U.S. economic recovery slowed
during the summer. Major international markets are not yet showing
clear signs of meaningful recovery.
    Steelcase expects third quarter revenue to be up 4 to 8 percent
from the prior year, including approximately $25 million of revenue
from the newly consolidated dealers and $8 million from the impact of
the steel surcharge. On a sequential quarter basis, the company
expects third quarter revenue to be similar to the second quarter.
    The company expects third quarter performance to be negatively
impacted by competitive price pressures and broad increases in raw
materials prices. For example, steel prices continue to rise and the
increase in the cost of steel is expected to be more than the amount
the company's previously announced steel surcharge will recover.
    Steelcase expects to report earnings between breakeven and $0.05
per share including anticipated restructuring charges of $(1) to $(3)
million after-tax in the third quarter.
    Mr. Hackett concluded, "During the recovery, we have many more
opportunities to provide new and existing customers with a better work
experience. We are continuing to improve productivity within the
company while reducing excess capacity, which is helping to improve
gross margins. However, we are also facing new challenges such as
rising steel, energy and healthcare costs, and other factors that put
additional pressure on the economic recovery, and on our margins. I am
very proud of the commitment of all our people to respond to these
opportunities and challenges, and to help Steelcase sustain profitable
growth."

and financial discussion and analysis contained in this report that
are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These
statements discuss goals, intentions and expectations as to future
trends, plans, events, results of operations or financial condition,
or state other information relating to the company, based on current

"believe," "could," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "intend," "may,"
"possible," "potential," "predict," "project," or other similar words,
phrases or expressions. Although Steelcase believes these
forward-looking statements are reasonable, they are based upon a
number of assumptions concerning future conditions, any or all of
which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Forward-looking
statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to vary. Important factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking

economic conditions and uncertainty domestically and internationally;
delayed or lost sales and other impacts related to acts of terrorism,
acts of war or governmental action; changes in domestic or
international laws, rules and regulations, including the impact of
changed environmental laws, rules or regulations; major disruptions at
our key facilities or in the supply of any key raw materials,
components or finished goods; competitive pricing pressure; pricing
changes by the company, its competitors or suppliers; currency
fluctuations; changes in customer demand and order patterns; changes
in the financial stability of customers, dealers (including changes in
their ability to pay for product and services, dealer financing and
other amounts owed to the company) or suppliers; changes in
relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and dealers, the
mix of products sold and of customers purchasing (including large
project business); the success (including product performance and
customer acceptance) of new products, current product innovations and
platform simplification, and their impact on the company's
manufacturing processes; the company's ability to successfully: reduce
its costs, including actions such as workforce reduction, facility
rationalization, disposition of excess assets (including real estate)
at more than book value and/or related impairments, production
consolidation, reduction of business complexity, culling products and
global supply chain management; the company's ability to successfully
implement a surcharge relating to cost increases in steel; implement
technology initiatives; integrate acquired businesses; migrate to a
less vertically integrated manufacturing model; implement lean
manufacturing principles; initiate and manage alliances; manage
consolidated dealers; possible acquisitions or divestitures by the
company; changes in business strategies and decisions; and other risks
detailed in the company's Form 10-K for the year ended February 27,
2004 and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The factors identified above are believed to be important factors (but
not necessarily all of the important factors) that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those expressed in any
forward-looking statement. Unpredictable or unknown factors could also
have material adverse effects on the company. All forward-looking
statements included in this report are expressly qualified in their
entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements. Steelcase undertakes
no obligation to update, amend, or clarify forward-looking statements,
