FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


               SANDY SPRING BANCORP REVISES 2004 EARNINGS GUIDANCE

OLNEY, MARYLAND, September 29, 2004 --- Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc.
(Nasdaq:SASR), the parent company of Sandy Spring Bank, today announced that it
expects earnings for the full year 2004 will be at or below the low end of its
previously issued earnings guidance of $1.90 to $2.10 per fully diluted share.

The company now expects full year earnings to be in a range of $1.80 to $1.90
per share for 2004. This change in earnings expectations follows the company's
preliminary review of its third quarter results, which indicates weaker than
expected net interest margin for the quarter and for the balance of 2004.

Sandy Spring Bancorp is scheduled to announce its third quarter earnings on
October 14th, and intends to hold a Webcast to discuss quarterly results at
2:00 p.m. (ET) that day.
