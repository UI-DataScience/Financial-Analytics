                  GTECH ANNOUNCES STRONG SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
                  ---------------------------------------------

WEST GREENWICH,  RI - (September 21, 2004) - GTECH Holdings  Corporation  (NYSE:
GTK) today announced  second quarter  earnings for fiscal year 2005 ended August
28, 2004.

"It was yet another quarter of steady growth and  profitability for GTECH," said
GTECH  President and Chief  Executive  Officer W. Bruce Turner.  "Total revenues
grew  approximately  17  percent,  quarter-over-quarter,   driven  by  continued
improvements in same-store sales, the benefit of recent acquisitions, and strong
product sales. In addition to a solid financial performance, we had a successful
quarter across all three GTECH vertical markets - lottery, gaming solutions, and
commercial services."

"We are  pleased  with  the  continued  strength  of our core  business  and the
progress we have made in integrating our recent acquisitions," said GTECH Senior
Vice  President and Chief  Financial  Officer  Jaymin B. Patel.  "We are excited
about the  opportunities  we see in each of the markets we serve, and based upon
our current outlook, we are confident we can achieve our goals and objectives in
the current fiscal year and beyond."


Operating Results
- -----------------

Earnings  and  dividends  per share for the three and six month  periods  of the
prior year have been restated to reflect the 2-for-1 common stock split effected
in the form of a stock  dividend,  which was  distributed  on July 30, 2004,  to
shareholders of record as of July 1, 2004.

Revenues  for the second  quarter of fiscal 2005 were $323.5  million,  up 16.7%
over revenues of $277.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Net income
was $53.1 million,  or $0.40 per diluted share, up 9.5% over net income of $48.5
million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the same period last year.

Revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2005 were $603.7  million,  up 16.8%
over  revenues  of $516.8  million in the first six months of fiscal  2004.  Net
income was $106.7 million,  or $0.80 per diluted share, up 19.2% over net income
of $89.5 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, for the same period last year. Net
income  in the  first  six  months of  fiscal  2005  includes  a net,  one-time,
after-tax  gain of $6.4  million,  or  approximately  $0.05 per  diluted  share,
associated  with the sale of the Company's 50% interest in Gaming  Entertainment
(Delaware)  L.L.C.,  net of charges  associated with the early retirement of the
remainder of the Company's 2007 private placement notes.


Cash Flow and Investments
- -------------------------

During the first six months of fiscal 2005, the Company generated $171.8 million
of cash from  operations  which,  along with other  sources  of  liquidity,  was
principally  used to fund the  Spielo  Manufacturing  Incorporated  and  Leeward
Islands Lottery Holding  Company,  Inc.  acquisitions of $192.4 million,  and to
purchase  systems,  equipment  and other assets  relating to contracts of $113.0
million.  In addition,  the Company  repaid the  remaining  $90.0 million of its
7.87% Senior Notes;  repurchased  $82.8  million,  or 3,649,500  shares,  of the
Company's common stock; and paid cash dividends of $20.1 million.

At the end of the  fiscal  2005  second  quarter,  GTECH  had $15.0  million  of
borrowings under its $300 million credit facility.


Financial Outlook
- -----------------

The  Company  provided  guidance  for the full year and third  quarter of fiscal
2005.

For the fiscal year ending  February 26, 2005,  GTECH  expects  service  revenue
growth in the range of 5% to 7%, and product  sales in the range of $210 million
to $220 million.

The Company continues to expect service profit margins to be in the range of 40%
to 42%, and product sale profit margins to be in the range of 36% to 38%.

The  Company  expects  the  effective  tax rate for the fiscal year to be in the
range of 35% to 36%,  compared  to 37%  reported in the first half of the fiscal
year. It expects the most  significant  portion of the rate  reduction will take
affect in the third quarter.

Based upon the  results of the first  half of the  fiscal  year and the  current
outlook,  it continues to expect earnings per share for fiscal 2005 to be in the
range of $1.43 to $1.48 on a  fully-diluted  basis,  reflecting the  two-for-one
stock split that occurred on July 30, 2004.

For the third  quarter of fiscal 2005,  ending  November  27, 2004,  the Company
expects  service  revenue  growth in the range of 6% to 8%, and product sales in
the range of $55 million to $65 million.  The Company expects service margins in
the range of 38% to 40%,  and  product  margins  in the range of 37% to 39%.  It
expects  the  effective  tax  rate  for the  quarter  to be  approximately  33%.
Accordingly,  the Company expects earnings per share to be in the range of $0.33
to $0.36 per share for the quarter.  This  compares  with $0.35  reported in the
same period last year,  which included a one-time,  after-tax,  non-cash gain of
$3.3 million,  or $0.03 per diluted share,  associated with the consolidation of
the partnership that owns the Company's headquarters facility in Rhode Island.


Second Quarter Highlights
- -------------------------

In the second quarter,  GTECH  continued to strengthen its market  leadership in
the core lottery  business.  Internationally,  the Company was chosen to provide
5,000 additional  handheld lottery terminals to Organizacion  Nacional de Ciegos
Espanoles  (ONCE)  in  Spain,  following  a  previous  order of  7,000  handheld
terminals  also  awarded to GTECH by ONCE in the second  quarter.  In  addition,
Cogetech,  a joint  venture  in  which  GTECH  is the  technology  and  services
provider,  was named a successful applicant for a five-year license to operate a
gaming machine  network and central  system in Italy.  The Company also signed a
long-term  integrated  services  contract  to provide a complete  video  lottery
solution in Jamaica. In Mexico, GTECH's original contract award with Pronosticos
para la  Asistencia  Publica  was  reinstated  in August,  and the new  six-year
integrated  services  contract  was  ultimately  signed by both parties in early
September 2004.

Domestically,  GTECH  signed a three-year  contract  extension in Oregon and was
awarded a new Instant Ticket Vending Machine (ITVM) contract in Maine.

On the  commercial  services  side,  GTECH began  selling  prepaid  mobile phone
top-ups through its 200 lottery  terminals in Barbados in June 2004. The Company
also launched bill payment  services at approximately  700 terminals  throughout
Poland utilizing the PolCard network.

Also in the quarter, GTECH unveiled GamePoint(TM),  the Company's new all-in-one
instant and online lottery terminal solution.  The innovative GamePoint terminal
dispenses  both  instant and online  tickets,  combining  GTECH's  world-leading
online expertise and Interlott's instant ticket self-service leadership.

"In total, we secured between $220 million and $240 million in total incremental
future revenues this last quarter," continued Mr. Turner.

After the close of the quarter,  GTECH signed a  three-year  contract  extension
with the Minnesota  State Lottery to commence on February 10, 2008. In addition,
to advance its commercial  services strategy,  the Company recently announced it
had acquired  BillBird  S.A.,  the leading  provider of electronic  bill payment
services in Poland.


Other Business Developments
- ---------------------------

Sri Lanka
- ---------

GTECH's customer in Sri Lanka, the Mahapola Higher Education  Scholarship  Trust
Fund  (MTF),  was  recently  notified  by the  Supreme  Court of the  Democratic
Socialist  Republic of Sri Lanka that it may resume with the  implementation  of
its  lottery  games  in the  country.  In March  2004,  lawsuits  were  filed by
competitors   challenging   GTECH's   contract   award  and  thus   delayed  the
implementation  of the instant  ticket and online  games in Sri Lanka.  All such
lawsuits  have  been  settled,  without  any  payment  by  GTECH,  and have been
dismissed.

change and to satisfy the future  technological  demands of its customers;  (xi)

                   Bruce Turner Q2 FY05 Conference Call Script
                            Final - 20 September 2004


Hello,  everyone  ... and welcome to our  discussion  of GTECH's  second-quarter
results.


Slide #4
- --------

As you have seen in this  morning's  release,  it was another  quarter of steady
growth  and  profitability  for GTECH  despite  the  challenges  in  Brazil  and
difficult quarter-over-quarter comparisons.

Total revenues grew  approximately 17 percent,  quarter over quarter,  driven by
continued improvements in same store sales and strong product sales.

Gross profit margins were within the expected range at 41 percent ... despite an
increase in depreciation...

Our operating  expense  ratio was 13 percent,  down a point and a half from last
quarter ...

Earnings per share came in at 40 cents per share ...  which was slightly  higher
than expected ...

We recorded $75 million in cash from operations.

And we have been able to maintain one of the highest returns on invested capital
in the gaming  industry,  despite a significant  increase in the average capital
employed in the business.

In addition to a solid financial performance, we had a successful quarter across
all three GTECH vertical  markets:  lottery,  gaming  solutions,  and commercial
services.

Among the lottery  highlights  were two new orders for handheld  terminals  from
ONCE, the Spanish National Organization for the Blind. With these orders - for a
total of 12 thousand  additional  terminals - the ONCE network will total 19,000
units,  making  it the  largest  lottery  network  in  Spain.  Clearly,  Spain's
visually-impaired retailers are very pleased with the terminals' ease of use and
performance.

The second  quarter also saw the situation in Mexico  resolved in GTECH's favor.
As you may recall, GTECH's winning bid to supply a new online lottery system and
network to our customer  ---Pronosticos --- was declared non-compliant in April.
However,  after an  appeal,  the  Mexican  Comptroller  Ministry  reversed  that
decision  last month ... and we have  recently  signed a new  six-year  contract
valued at approximately $90 million dollars.

In August, we signed a three-year  contract  extension worth up to approximately
$25 million dollars with the Oregon Lottery. The deal calls for GTECH to replace
Oregon's  existing video lottery central system with our Enterprise Series Video
system. We will also be providing 2,000  internet-protocol - or IP--ready Altura
site  controllers,  which will link more than 10,000 VLTs to the central system.
This new  contract  will take effect in 2005,  marking  Oregon's  20th year as a
valued GTECH customer.

On the opposite  side of the country,  we recently  secured a contract  with the
state of Maine. Under the terms of the contract,  we will be supplying the Maine
Lottery with 150 Instant Ticket Vending Machines. This is our fourth consecutive
ITVM  contract win and serves as further  validation of how the  acquisition  of
Interlott has enhanced GTECH's ability to pursue and win new business.  In fact,
we have  been so  successful  in the  ITVM  space  since  the  acquisition  that
Interlott's production hit an all-time high in the month of July.

There was good news in our Gaming Solutions  business,  as well ... with a video
central system win in Italy through our joint venture,  Cogetech ... and a total
VLT system win in Jamaica.

The contract  with Italy is  significant  because,  although the Italian  gaming
market  ranks eighth in the world in terms of total  gaming  sales,  much of its
legalized gaming machine market remains  untapped.  Up to 65,000 gaming machines
will be deployed throughout Italy and connected to our Enterprise Series central
system.  The  Jamaican  VLT  contract  is the  second  one for which  GTECH is a
single-source vendor, providing all components. Initially, we will install about
125 video lottery  terminals,  with an option to expand from there. We expect to
generate  up to $60  million  dollars  in  revenues  from  the  contract  by its
conclusion in 2011.

All told,  we secured  between $220  million and $240  million  dollars in total
incremental future revenues this last quarter.

In the  Commercial  Services  vertical,  we  continued  to expand  our  services
successfully  in Latin America and Poland.  In June,  we began selling  pre-paid
mobile phone top-ups through our lottery terminals in Barbados. We also launched
bill payment services at approximately 700 terminals throughout Poland utilizing
the  PolCard  network.  And two weeks ago,  we  acquired  BillBird,  the leading
provider  of  electronic  bill  payments  in Poland,  with over 2,000  points of
access.  GTECH is now the leader in this emerging  industry in Poland ... and we
are well positioned to become a commercial  services market leader in one of the
most significant markets in Central and Eastern Europe.


Slide #5
- --------

When we look at the factors  that fueled our lottery  performance  in the second
quarter,  new games  continued  to be a key  driver.  In late May,  we  launched
HotTrax,  a new  monitor-based  lottery game, at select  locations here in Rhode
Island.  Since the launch,  we have seen total  sales of monitor  games at these
locations increase by an average of 24%.

Encouraged by this performance,  we are currently  developing a suite of monitor
games tied to popular  spectator sports that will add further  excitement to the
social space play experience.

At the same time, we are moving  forward  aggressively  to enhance our e-scratch
offerings. Starting this quarter and continuing for the next year or so, we will
introduce  four new  e-scratch  games every  quarter.  The games  scheduled  for
release in  October  include a  sports-themed  game ... a  Halloween  game ... a
casino  style  3-reel game that will allow for  multiple  line matches and bonus
rounds  ... and a  crossword-style  game.  We believe  that these will add a new
element of revenue-stimulating excitement and anticipation for players.

We also continue to develop ways to generate new revenue  through branded games,
instant-online games such as Extra and Bingo, and promotional on-line games tied
to major  events.  Earlier  this year,  we announced an agreement to develop and
distribute  lottery games based on Hasbro's  Monopoly and Battleship  games.  We
plan to release our first Monopoly-themed games into the traditional on-line and
on-line instant markets in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. Very soon, we
hope to be  announcing  another  branded  monitor  game to  complement  Keno and
HotTrax ... and we will bring you all the details as soon as they are available.

We have also  invested  in game  development  at Spielo  since  closing  on that
acquisition  in late April and we plan to release  three new video lottery games
in the New York market by the end of this  calendar  year.  The first release is
scheduled for installation this week.

In  addition  to  developing  new  games  for New York,  we are  developing  new
multi-line video games for the wide-area, racino and casino marketplaces. We are
also pursuing licensing  agreements with third-party  content developers ... and
we are  exploring  ways to  license  Spielo  content  in Class II and  Class III
markets.  As I have said  before,  it is our goal to become  the  number-one  or
number-two player in the markets in which we operate,  and we believe increasing
our investment in content development will help us attain that goal.

Convenience and self-service  are also important  factors in driving new lottery
sales. To that end, we recently introduced GamePoint,  an all-in-one instant and
online lottery  self-service  terminal  solution.  GamePoint extends the product
value inherent in Interlott's  instant  ticket vending by  incorporating  online
functionality and end-to-end connectivity. This product will allow us to upgrade
the existing 30,000 instant ticket vending machines in the marketplace today ...
as well as  helping  us  expand  into new  markets.  We plan to ship  the  first
GamePoint  machines to  Washington  in the  beginning  of 2005.  If the positive
industry  response we have received thus far is any  indication,  GamePoint will
help accelerate the already-fast growth in the ITVM/self-service space.

In addition to these developments, we are pursuing a number of new opportunities
in Lottery  and Gaming  Solutions.  We are  currently  waiting for a decision in
Thailand,  where we have bid on a new on-line  lottery system as part of a joint
venture with Loxley, a Thai  conglomerate.  We were one of only two companies to
make the short list after  technical  evaluations ... and a final decision could
be made within a matter of weeks.

We have also recently rebid for our lottery contract in Missouri,  and we expect
a decision from them some time in the third quarter.

In  Pennsylvania,  where  the state  government  recently  approved  legislation
allowing  video lottery  terminals at race tracks,  we have submitted a bid on a
VLT central system contract and we plan to pursue machine opportunities there as
well. We also have proposals  pending for video central  systems in Manitoba and
the Atlantic  Lottery  Corporation  in Canada ... and we are looking at upcoming
VLT opportunities in Louisiana and Maine.

Meanwhile,  we are  actively  pursuing  new  lottery  opportunities  in Finland,
Germany and New Zealand... a new multi-channel interactive gaming opportunity in
Ireland ... and several government  licensing  opportunities,  including on-line
systems for hunting and fishing permits in Illinois and Kansas.

Closer to home,  the Rhode  Island  Supreme  Court  recently  ruled the proposed
legislation allowing for a casino in West Warwick to be unconstitutional. On the
heels of this news,  we expect the owners of Lincoln Park and Newport  Grand Jai
Alai to pursue their plans to expand their lottery-run VLT operations. Under the
terms of our Master Agreement with the state of Rhode Island, GTECH will provide
the next 700 machines installed, plus 50% of any additional machines.

On the  operational  side of things,  the  integration  of our  acquisitions  is
proceeding  according  to  plan  and we are  beginning  to see  the  inter-group
benefits  of  Spielo  and  LILHCo,   particularly  between  lottery  and  gaming
solutions.

Now,  before I turn  things  over to  Jaymin,  I would  like to give you a brief
update on the  situation in Brazil ... and the latest on our capital  allocation
program.

When last we  spoke,  a court in  Brazil  had  decided  to  withhold  30% of our
revenues  pending the outcome of a civil suit  against  GTECH.  We appealed  the
court's decision ... and that appeal is still pending.  In the meantime,  we are
continuing  to work with our  customer  in Brazil to find a  solution  that will
allow us to remain in the country.

In fact,  I recently  met with  members of Caixa to discuss  their plans for the
future and to reiterate our desire to find a solution that allows us to continue
our partnership.  However,  I want to assure you that the outcome of the current
situation  -  whichever  way it goes - will not have an  impact  on  either  our
long-term  strategy  ...  or our  long-term  outlook.  Since we first  announced
developments  in Brazil,  we have announced 14 new contracts and extensions with
customers around the globe and we have seen no disruption to our business.

As our recent announcement  regarding the acquisition of BillBird indicates,  we
continue to identify and evaluate  acquisition  candidates  that we believe will
drive long term growth and  shareholder  value.  We continue to believe it is an
opportunity-rich environment.


Slide #6
- --------

Finally,  in  keeping  with our  long-standing  commitment  to  return  value to
shareholders,  we returned approximately $65 million dollars to our shareholders
in  the  second  quarter.  This  included  our  regular  quarterly  dividend  of
approximately  $10  million  dollars in July.  We also  repurchased  2.6 million
shares of GTECH  stock in the  quarter at a cost of  approximately  $55  million
dollars. As of today, we have 115.7 million shares outstanding and approximately
$10 million dollars remaining under the current repurchase  program. We continue
to believe that GTECH stock  represents  a good  investment  opportunity  at the
current trading levels.

All told, on a  year-to-date  basis,  we have returned in excess of $100 million
dollars to our shareholders through the dividend and share repurchase programs.

And with that,  I would  like to turn the  proceedings  over to our CFO,  Jaymin
Patel.

Jaymin: Thank you Bruce.  Good morning, everyone.


Slide #7
- --------

I would like to start by reviewing GTECH's  second-quarter  performance.  We are
certainly  pleased  with  the  performance  of  the  business  in the  light  of
challenges we faced in Brazil and  difficult  quarter-over  quarter  comparisons
created by  significant  jackpot  activity in the second  quarter of last fiscal
year combined with the impact of increased capital deployed in the business over
the last twelve months.

I would  like to remind  everyone  that all  references  to  earnings  per share
reflect the two-for-one (2-for-1) stock split, that occurred on July 30th.

Second quarter service  revenues  increased more than ten million dollars ($10M)
or approximately four percent (4%), driven by a number of factors.

A  closer  review  of the  underlying  dynamics  of the  business  will  help to
illustrate  what those key  drivers  were.  Let's start with a review of lottery
service  revenues.  In the U.S.,  same store sales increased  approximately  six
percent  (6%),  with the  majority  of our  domestic  jurisdictions  once  again
enjoying improved sales.

This increase in same store sales continues to be driven by the  introduction of
new games,  modifications to existing games,  such as jackpot  changes,  and the
marketing efforts of our customers. We also benefited from the launch of our new
service contract in Tennessee and the impact of the Interlott acquisition.

The increase in lottery  service  revenues was partially  offset by  contractual
rate  changes,  resulting  in  domestic  service  revenues  of one  hundred  and
twenty-nine  million dollars ($129M), up approximately two percent (2%) over the
second quarter of last fiscal year.

International same store lottery sales grew by approximately two percent (2%) on
a constant currency basis,  reflecting new games such as Big Lotto in Taiwan, as
well as expanded distribution channels, including Keno in Beijing.
Factoring  in higher  jackpot  activity  and the  favorable  impact  of  foreign
exchange rates,  offset by contractual rate changes and the thirty percent (30%)
withholding  of our  revenues  in  Brazil,  our  international  lottery  service
revenues  increased by  approximately  four percent (4%), to ninety-one  million
dollars ($91M).

Total service  revenues  included  approximately  eight million dollars ($8M) of
service revenue from gaming  solutions,  up  approximately  four million dollars
($4M) over the same  period  last year.  This was driven by the  addition of new
video lottery terminals in Rhode Island and the acquisition of Spielo.

We also  recorded  approximately  nineteen  million  dollars  ($19M) of  service
revenue from  commercial  transaction  processing,  which was  comparable to the
second quarter of last fiscal year. Whilst we experienced an approximate  eleven
percent (11%) increase in same store sales quarter over quarter,  this was again
offset by the thirty percent (30%) withholding of revenues in Brazil.


Slide #8
- --------

Product sales in the second quarter were  seventy-five  million  dollars ($75M),
driven by terminal sales to our customer in Belgium combined with the first of 3
terminal shipments to ONCE in Spain.

Gross profit  increased  by  approximately  sixteen  million  dollars  ($16M) or
thirteen  percent  (13%)  quarter-over-quarter.  Service  gross profit  declined
approximately six million dollars ($6M) quarter-over-quarter. This was primarily
the result of higher depreciation and amortization and the impact of the revenue
withholding in Brazil.

Product margins were stronger than anticipated, at forty-one point eight percent
(41.8%), due to changes in the product mix.

Our operating expenses for the quarter were forty-two point five million dollars
($42.5M), or approximately thirteen percent (13%) of total revenue.

The two point eight million dollar ($2.8M) increase in SG&A was driven primarily
by the  consolidation of acquisitions  and increased  activities in new business
development.

This was partially offset by lower research and development expenses,  primarily
due to the timing of development initiatives.

The strength in revenues drove operating income growth of approximately fourteen
million dollars ($14M) or nineteen percent (19%).

Below the operating income line,  other expense  increased  approximately  seven
million  dollars  ($7M),  driven  by lower  equity  income  from  unconsolidated
affiliates as a result of the sale of our equity interest in Harrington  Raceway
in  Delaware,  combined  with higher  interest  expense  resulting  from the two
hundred and fifty million dollars ($250M) of debt issued in the third quarter of
last fiscal year.

Net income for the quarter increased approximately five million dollars ($5M) or
approximately  ten percent (10%) and we reported  diluted  earnings per share of
forty cents ($0.40), up approximately eight percent (8%) over the second quarter
of last fiscal year.


Slide #9
- --------

During the quarter,  we generated  seventy-five  million  dollars ($75M) in cash
flows from operations.

This financed  approximately  sixty-three  million  dollars  ($63M) in investing
activities.

Also in the quarter,  we repurchased  approximately two point six million shares
(2.6M) of GTECH stock at a cost of fifty-five million dollars ($55M) and we made
our  quarterly  dividend  payment in the  amount of  approximately  ten  million
dollars ($10M).


Slide #10
- ---------

Now, let's turn to GTECH's performance on a year to date basis.

Service  revenues  for the six months  ended  August 28th were up  approximately
forty million dollars ($40M) or nine percent (9%) over the same period of fiscal
year 2004,  driven by the  continued  strength  in same store  sales  around the
world, new contracts and the impact of acquisitions.

Product sales were higher in the first six months of this year, primarily due to
higher terminal sales and the impact of acquisitions.


Slide #11
- ---------

Year-to-date,  we recorded two hundred  sixty-nine  million  dollars  ($269M) in
revenue  from our US  lottery  group --- two  hundred  and  sixty-three  million
dollars  ($263M)  from  the   international   lottery  group  ---  approximately
thirty-one  million  dollars  ($31M) in gaming  solutions and forty-one  million
dollars in commercial and other services ($41M).


Slide #12
- ---------

In the first six months of the  fiscal  year,  we  generated  approximately  one
hundred  and  seventy-two  million  dollars  ($172M)  in cash  from  operations.
Combined  with  cash and short  term  investments  on the  balance  sheet,  this
financed over three hundred  million  dollars  ($300M) in investing  activities,
representing new contract assets and acquisitions.

In addition,  we paid cash  dividends of twenty  million  dollars  ($20M) and we
accelerated our return of cash to shareholders via the share repurchase program.
On a  year-to-date  basis,  we  repurchased  a total of three  point six million
shares  (3.6M)  of our  stock at a cost of  approximately  eighty-three  million
dollars ($83M).

As of August 28th, we had cash of  approximately  thirty million  dollars ($30M)
and we had approximately two hundred fifty-six million dollars ($256M) available
under our revolving line of credit.


Slide #13
- ---------

Average capital employed grew by over four hundred million dollars  ($400M),  or
fifty-two  percent  (52%),  year-over-year  and we generated  returns on capital
employed of nineteen point two percent  (19.2%).  In view of the pace of capital
investment,  we are pleased to have been able to maintain returns on the overall
portfolio at more than two times (2x) our weighted average cost of capital.

Again,  our  Return  on  Capital   Employed   calculation  is  provided  in  the
Supplemental Financial Data File posted on our website.

Those are the key financial  highlights of our second quarter and  year-to-date.
Now I would like to turn our  attention  to the  outlook  for the  remainder  of
fiscal year 2005.


Slide #14
- ---------

Based upon the strength of our performance year-to-date, we are confident in our
ability to deliver  results in line with the full year  guidance  we provided at
the end of June.

Based upon our current  outlook,  we continue to expect total revenue  growth in
the range of eighteen to nineteen  percent  (18% - 19%),  with  service  revenue
growth in the range of five to seven percent (5% - 7%), based upon the following
assumptions and factors:

1) Same store  sales  growth of four to six percent (4% - 6%), 2) The net effect
of contract  wins and  contractual  rate  changes,  3)  Fluctuations  of foreign
currency  against  the US  Dollar,  4) The  impact of the  acquisitions  we have
completed to date, and 5) The impact of the 30% withholding of Brazil revenues.

We continue to expect  product  sales in the range of two hundred and ten to two
hundred and twenty million dollars ($210M - $220M).

We expect service margins in the range of forty to forty-two percent (40% - 42%)
and product margins in the range of thirty-six to  thirty-eight  percent (36% to
38%).

With respect to our tax rate, we continue to believe that the effective tax rate
for this fiscal year will be thirty-five  to thirty-six  percent (35% - 36%), or
one to two  percent  (1% - 2%)  lower  than the  thirty-seven  percent  (37%) we
reported  in the first half of the fiscal  year.  This is  primarily  due to the
change in the  composition of our revenues and profits as a result of our recent
acquisitions of non-US-based  companies. We expect the lion's share of the catch
up to occur in the third quarter.

Based upon this outlook,  we believe that diluted  earnings per share will be in
the range of one dollar  and  forty-three  cents to one  dollar and  forty-eight
cents ($1.43 to $1.48) per share for fiscal year 2005,  assuming a fully diluted
share count of one hundred and thirty-three point seven million (133.7M) shares.

This estimate includes the impact of the net one-time gain recorded in the first
quarter.

In fiscal year 2005, we plan to invest  between five hundred and twenty and five
hundred  and forty  million  dollars  ($520M - $540M),  including  the  recently
completed  acquisitions.  This  investing  activity  will be funded by cash from
operations and borrowings under our revolving line of credit.


Slide #15
- ---------

Now let's look at the outlook for our third quarter, which ends November 27th.

We expect  service  revenues to increase six to eight  percent (6% - 8%) quarter
over  quarter  and we  expect  product  sales  in the  range  of  fifty-five  to
sixty-five million dollars ($55M - $65M).

We expect service  margins to be in the range of  thirty-eight  to forty percent
(38% to 40%) and product  margins in the range of  thirty-seven  to  thirty-nine
percent (37% to 39%).

We believe  the tax rate for the quarter we will be  approximately  thirty-three
percent (33%), due to the reasons I mentioned earlier.

Finally,  we expect  earnings  per share to be in the range of  thirty-three  to
thirty six cents  ($0.33 to $0.36) per share.  This  compares to the thirty five
cents  ($0.35) per share we reported in the third  quarter of last fiscal  year,
which  included  a  one-time,   after-tax  non-cash  gain  associated  with  the
consolidation  of the partnership that owns our corporate  headquarters  here in
Rhode Island.  Excluding  that gain,  recurring  earnings per share in the third
quarter of last year were  thirty-two  cents  ($0.32) per share,  as reported by
First Call.


Slide #16
- ---------

To summarize ... We are pleased with the continued strength of our core business
and the progress we have made in  integrating  our recent  acquisitions,  we are
excited about the opportunities we see in each of the markets we serve - - - and
based on our  current  outlook,  we are  confident  we can achieve our goals and
objectives in the current fiscal year and beyond.

Thank you for your  attention.  Now  Bruce  and I would be happy to  answer  any
questions that you may have.
