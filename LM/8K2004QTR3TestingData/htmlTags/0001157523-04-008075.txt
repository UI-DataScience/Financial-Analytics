         Angelica Reports Second Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results;
  Company Expects to Achieve Earnings in the Range of $1.15 to $1.30
                            for Fiscal 2004

    ST. LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 23, 2004--Angelica Corporation
(NYSE: AGL), a leading provider of healthcare linen management
services, today reported financial results for the second quarter and
six months ended July 31, 2004. Continuing operations results exclude
the Company's Life Uniform retail division, which was sold during the
second quarter to Healthcare Uniform Company, Inc., an affiliate of
Sun Capital Partners, Inc., and is shown as discontinued operations.
    Revenue from continuing operations for the second quarter of
fiscal 2004 was $77.9 million, an increase of 9.7% from $71.0 million
in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. The increase in revenue was due
to contributions from recent laundry acquisitions, as well as organic
growth from increased market penetration and new facilities. Net
income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal
2004 was $2.8 million or $.30 per diluted share, compared to $3.6
million or $.40 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal
2003. Fiscal 2003 included $1.9 million of non-operating income in
connection with the payment of a distribution upon liquidation of an
insurance carrier of the Company.
    Income from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 was
$3.7 million, up 8.1% from $3.5 million in fiscal 2003. Increased
revenue and a $1.3 million gain from the sale of non-healthcare
accounts in Daytona Beach, Florida in the second quarter of fiscal
2004 were offset to some extent by increased natural gas, linen and
labor costs, costs associated with closing the Daytona Beach facility,
and start-up costs in our two new Carolina plants, including the
healthcare laundry facility at Duke University in North Carolina
acquired in the second quarter.
    The second quarter net loss from the discontinued Life Uniform
operations was $1.3 million. The Company completed the sale of its
Life Uniform retail division to Healthcare Uniform Company on July 31,
2004. The assets sold included 196 retail uniform and shoe stores, as
well as Life Uniform's fully-integrated catalogue, e-commerce and
on-the-job shopping platform operations and associated inventory. A
total of 17 stores not included in the sale have been closed.
    For the six months ended July 31, 2004, revenue from continuing
operations increased 9.3% to $155.6 million from $142.3 million for
the same period in 2003. As in the second quarter, the increase in
revenue was due to a combination of acquisitions and organic growth.
Net income from continuing operations was $5.3 million or $.58 per
diluted share, as compared to $5.8 million or $.65 per diluted share
during the same period in 2003. Increased revenue was offset by higher
gas, linen and labor costs, as well as start-up costs in our two new
Carolina plants.
    For the first six months ended July 31, 2004 net loss from the
discontinued Life Uniform operations was $3.6 million. This included a
loss from operations of $0.6 million and a loss on the sale of assets
of $3.0 million.
    "We are pleased with the results achieved during the first half of
2004 especially given the difficult natural gas market," said Steve
O'Hara, President and CEO. "Our solid revenue growth is a reflection
of increased focus on our healthcare linen management services and the
market opportunity. With the completion of the sale of Life Uniform,
we can now focus all of our resources on capturing these
opportunities. We continue to expect to deliver fiscal year earnings
from continuing operations of $1.15 to $1.30 per share in 2004."
    Mr. O'Hara continued, "At the beginning of this year, we outlined
our goals of streamlining our business to become a 'pure play'
healthcare linen management provider, which we did by selling our Life
Uniform business, and to use our solid balance sheet and cash flow to
invest in energy-efficient equipment and increase our market share in
healthcare linen management through acquisitions and organic growth.
Since last Fall, we have opened two new, more efficient facilities in
South Carolina and Arizona, acquired healthcare linen plants in
Florida and North Carolina, and acquired selected assets of two small
regional competitors and two hospital on-premise laundry (OPL)
facilities."
    Mr. O'Hara concluded, "We are excited about our long-term growth
opportunities as healthcare providers increasingly seek a
cost-effective, quality-controlled option for their linen services. In
addition, we are aggressively pursuing accretive acquisitions to
utilize better our debt capacity to grow our business.
    Angelica Corporation will host a conference call on August 24,
2004 to discuss its fiscal year 2004 second quarter results at 10:00
AM CDT (11:00 AM Eastern). The conference call will be broadcast live
