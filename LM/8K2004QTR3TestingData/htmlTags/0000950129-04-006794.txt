                     CALAVO GROWERS, INC. REPORTS PROFITABLE
                   FISCAL THIRD QUARTER AND NINE-MONTH RESULTS

                         ------------------------------

    -   Quarterly Sales Reach Highest Single-Period Total in Company History

    -   Nine-Month Sales Rise 14 Percent Year-to-Year, A New Record

    -   Uruapan, Mexico Processed Plant Completes First Full Quarter of
        Operation

                         ------------------------------

SANTA ANA, Calif. (Aug. 30, 2004) -- Calavo Growers, Inc. (Nasdaq-NM: CVGW), the
global leader in packing and distributing fresh and processed avocados and other
perishable fruit products, today reported fiscal 2004 third-quarter and
nine-month operating results.

        For the three months ended July 31, 2004, net revenues climbed to $83.3
million, the highest quarterly total in company history, up from $81.4 million
in the like period of fiscal 2003. Third-quarter net income approximated $3.1
million, equal to $0.23 per fully diluted share. This compares with net income
of $3.2 million, or $0.25 per fully diluted share, in the year-earlier third
quarter. Per share results for the recently concluded quarter are based on
approximately four percent greater shares outstanding than in last year's third
quarter, in part due to Calavo's all-stock acquisition of Maui Fresh
International completed in Nov. 2003.

        Calavo stated that its profitable financial results in the most recently
concluded quarter are principally attributable "to a strong performance in the
company's California avocado segment, which experienced significant volume
growth." The company reported that increased sales from the International
avocados and perishable food products (International) segment also contributed
to third-quarter revenue growth.

        As a result of the sales expansion in the International operating
segment, net revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 increased 14
percent to a record $208.8 million, from $183.0 million in the corresponding
period one-year earlier. Nine-month net income was $5.1 million, equivalent to
$0.38 per fully diluted share, which compares with $5.5 million, or $0.42 per
diluted share, in the corresponding period one-year earlier. Lee E. Cole,
chairman, president and chief executive officer, stated: "Calavo's focused
approach to implementing its strategic operating agenda enabled the company to
complete another successful quarter and nine months. The company continues to
gain sales momentum, as reflected by our record revenues for the three and
nine-month periods, and make notable progress on a range of initiatives intended
to anchor future growth and profitability."

        Specifically, Cole referenced advances made along several business
fronts including:


<PAGE>
    -   A significant increase in third-quarter volume of fresh California
        avocados compared to the prior year, due to a significantly larger
        domestic crop. The company estimates its quarter to date share of the
        California avocado market totaled 33.4 percent, which represents an
        increase from the prior year, which was 31.7%.

    -   Increased growth from International segment sales, including continued
        robust demand from the Japanese market.

    -   The first full quarter of operation of the company's new, 90,000-plus
        square foot processed-products manufacturing facility in Uruapan,
        Michoacan, Mexico, which opened in February 2004.

    "With respect to the new facility," Cole said, "while third-quarter sales in
the Processed Products segment fell beneath plan, we continue to gain
efficiencies, and to build inventories to levels at which we can satisfy
customer demand."

    "Simply put, we believe this new plant will ultimately bring unprecedented
efficiencies to our processed unit. However, this process is taking longer then
anticipated," Cole stated.

        Turning to Calavo's commitment to cost containment, Cole stated that
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by nearly four percent
from last year's third quarter, and are virtually unchanged for the nine-month
period.

        "We view our ability to control SG&A -- even as Calavo mounts ambitious
initiatives, like the Uruapan processing facility, and contends with higher
employee salary and benefit costs -- as testament to a rigorous discipline of
holding the line on costs that is central to the company mindset," Cole said.

        The Calavo balance sheet remains "strong and virtually free of long-term
debt," Cole added. At July 31, 2004, shareholders' equity totaled $46.9 million,
an increase of 26 percent from $37.1 million at the end of fiscal 2003.

CALIFORNIA AVOCADOS

        California avocado sales of $66.7 million were $1.2 million, or 1.8
percent below the $67.9 million in last year's fiscal third period. The decrease
in sales reflects lower average selling prices, partially offset by a
significantly larger number of units sold.



                                       2
<PAGE>
INTERNATIONAL

        International segment sales increased 110 percent to $9.8 million, a
jump of $5.1 million from $4.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. This
increase is principally due to sales from the company's tropical fruit and
specialty products.

PROCESSED PRODUCTS

        Net sales in the processed products segment fell 23 percent to $6.8
million from $8.8 million in the comparable quarter one year ago. The factors
impacting the business unit's performance are thought by management to be
transitional in nature. Sales were adversely affected as inventory levels were
not adequate to meet processed-product customer demand.

FOURTH QUARTER OUTLOOK

        "We are proceeding into the fourth quarter with increasing momentum and
a sense of confidence about our business units," said Cole. "The California
Avocado segment is expected to continue yielding robust volume, particularly
when measured against last year's seasonally lower domestic crop. "

        "International segment sales are expected to remain strong for the
remainder of the fiscal year" he continued. "The outlook for our Processed
Products segment is positive due to the substantial elimination of the use of
co-packers, the expected closing of our Mexicali operations, and the increased
levels of inventory to service customer demand. We expect continued progress
from our processed products segment, but have no illusions about this occurring
overnight and expect that the greatest gains may not be evident until next
fiscal year."
