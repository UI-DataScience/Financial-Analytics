                     THIRD QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 2004 RESULTS

                        COMPANY RETURNS TO PROFITABILITY
                  SHOWS SOLID REVENUE GROWTH COMPARED TO MARKET


MINNEAPOLIS, MN - AUGUST 26, 2004 - PLATO Learning, Inc. (NASDAQ: TUTR), a
leading provider of K-Adult computer-based and e-learning solutions, today
announced revenues for its third quarter ended July 31, 2004, totaling $40.6
million. This represents a $16.8 million or a 71% increase versus the $23.8
million reported for the comparable period of fiscal 2003. The Company's
acquisition of Lightspan, Inc. in November 2003 significantly contributed to the
revenue growth for the quarter and year-to-date ended July 31, 2004.

(1)  Lightspan revenues prior to acquisition.

Net earnings for the third quarter of 2004 were $6.7 million, or $0.29 per
diluted share, as compared to $0.3 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the
same period of 2003. The third quarter results for the period ended July 31,
2003, included tax expense of $1.6 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. Tax
expense for the quarter ended July 31, 2004 was related to non-deductible
goodwill and was $150,000, or $.01 per diluted share. The tax expense reduction
between periods resulted from the full valuation allowance the Company provided
against its deferred tax assets in connection with the acquisition of Lightspan
and from the losses incurred year-to-date in fiscal 2004.

The acquisition of Lightspan also added significant expenses to the Company's
operations, the impact of which has been partially offset by cost reductions
from operating synergies of the merged businesses.

(1)  PLATO operating expenses for the quarter and nine months in 2003 exclude
     $422 and $802 of restructuring charges, respectively.

(2)  Lightspan operating expenses prior to acquisition.

John Murray, Chairman, President and CEO, said, "Our financial performance for
the third quarter clearly demonstrates the significant financial leverage of our
business model. We returned to profitability this quarter with $6.9 million of
operating income, representing 17% of revenue. Operating income also improved
from second quarter 2004 by over $10 million, further demonstrating both our
financial leverage and the additional cost synergies achieved since the
Lightspan acquisition. Our cash and investments grew over $9 million during the
quarter, including over $12 million provided by operating activities. Given the
relatively fixed nature of most of our cost structure, our financial performance
is expected to continue to improve as revenues grow."

Mr. Murray continued, "While the market has been softer than expected, we have
successfully grown revenues and deferred revenues at rates greater than the
market growth rate by capturing market share. This growth reflects the superior
quality and strength of our product offering. With a broad market leading
portfolio of accountability, assessment and curriculum products and services, we
are uniquely positioned to take full advantage of this growth. As our business
model has demonstrated, this growth is expected to continue to generate improved
financial performance and, accordingly, increased value for our shareholders."

The Company highlighted additional key financial information:

o    Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA),
     calculated as operating income before depreciation, amortization and
     restructuring charges, were $17.9 million for the twelve month period ended
     July 31, 2004 as compared to $4.9 million for the twelve month period ended
     July 31, 2003.

o    Cash and marketable securities were $31.0 million at July 31, 2004,
     compared to $21.7 million at April 30, 2004. No bank borrowings were
     outstanding at July 31, 2004.

o    Deferred revenue was $42.9 million at July 31, 2004, versus $39.7 million
     at July 31, 2003, which includes Lightspan deferred revenue on a pro-forma
     basis.

o    Stockholders' equity was $157.2 million at July 31, 2004, compared to
     $109.9 million at October 31, 2003 and $106.6 million at July 31, 2003.

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release exclude the impact of
an income tax benefit in 2003, and a 2003 restructuring charge on PLATO
Learning's operating results, as well as present EBITDA and certain combined
operations as if Lightspan had been acquired as of November 1, 2002. These
non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial
measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be
considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial
performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. PLATO Learning's management views
these non-GAAP financial measures to be helpful in assessing the Company's
progress in integrating the operations of Lightspan. In addition, these non-GAAP
financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to PLATO
Learning's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors'
operating results. PLATO Learning includes these non-GAAP financial measures in
its earnings announcement, because the Company believes they are useful to
investors in allowing for greater transparency related to supplemental
information used by management in its financial and operational analysis.
Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial
measures used in this press release to their most directly comparable GAAP
financial measures as provided with the financial statements attached to this
press release.
