             iMergent Announces Record Fourth Quarter and
                 Full-year 2004 Revenues and Profits

    OREM, Utah--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 8, 2004--iMergent, Inc.,
(AMEX:IIG)

    --  Fourth Quarter Revenue Increases 82% and Year-end Revenue
        Increases 74%

    --  EBT per Diluted Share Triples to $0.30 for Quarter and Up 80%
        to $0.79 for Fiscal 2004

    iMergent, Inc., (AMEX:IIG) a leading provider of eCommerce and
software for small businesses and entrepreneurs, announced today its
results for the fiscal fourth quarter and year-ended June 30, 2004.
    Total revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30, 2004
rose to $25.0 million from $13.7 million in the same quarter of 2003.
The 82 percent revenue growth is attributable to the increasing number
of training workshops conducted by the company and other marketing
initiatives, including the significant rise in international business.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the company hosted 37 international
workshops, which generated approximately $4.9 million in revenue. In
the fourth quarter of 2003, the company did not conduct any
international workshops.
    Operating expenses for the quarter were $16.0 million compared to
$9.8 million in 2003. The increase is directly attributable to the
significantly higher sales. As a percent of sales operating expenses
decreased 6.9 percent to 64.1 percent of sales compared with 71.0
percent in the fourth quarter of 2003, reflecting improving operating
leverage and tight expense controls.
    Earnings before income taxes (EBT) for the fiscal fourth quarter
ended June 30, 2004 more than tripled to $3.7 million from $1.2
million in the same quarter of 2003. EBT per diluted share also
tripled to $0.30 for the fourth quarter 2004 from $0.10 for the fourth
quarter of 2003. Net income for the fiscal fourth quarter increased to
$2.5 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to net income of
$1.6 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the comparable quarter
of the prior fiscal year.
    Revenue for the year-ended June 30, 2004 grew to $81.0 million
compared to $46.5 million for the same period last year, representing
a 74 percent increase. EBT for the year-ended June 30, 2004 rose to
$9.6 million from $5.0 million in the prior year, an increase of 91
percent. EBT per diluted share was $0.79 for the year, an 80 percent
increase over $0.44 for the prior year. As a result of its strong
earnings history, during the year iMergent recognized a $12.3 million
non-cash income tax benefit based on the reversal of the valuation
allowance against its deferred tax asset, which consists mainly of net
operating losses carried forward (NOL) from prior periods and largely
reduces future tax burdens on cash. At June 30, 2004, the total
deferred tax asset was $13.1 million. As a result, net income for the
year-ended June 30, 2004 including the income tax benefit increased to
$21.9 million, or $1.80 per diluted share, compared to $5.0 million,
or $0.44 per diluted share, in the prior year.

    Highlights

    --  Began trading on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) on August
        16th under the ticker "IIG," which will be celebrated when
        iMergent's management team opens the stock exchange on
        September 14th.

    --  Increased the number of StoresOnline(TM) workshops held to 164
        during the quarter and 544 during the year. The company
        conducted 37 international workshops during the quarter and 58
        during the year.

    --  Expanded customer support services to include chat and email
        24-hours a day, 7-days a week.

    --  Added UPS OnLine(R) Tools to the StoresOnline(TM) platform
        enabling merchants to reduce operating costs, increase
        shipping efficiencies and improve customer service - for no
        additional charge to the merchants. To use UPS OnLine Tools
        merchants simply need to open a standard UPS shipping account
        and activate their websites.

    --  Extended international sales by visiting the United Kingdom
        for the first time and returning to Australia, Canada, and New
        Zealand.

    --  In August, announced a new two-year, $5 million line of credit
        with Bank One. The new line of credit replaces its previous
        credit facility and will provide accessible working capital to
        support the company's growth initiatives. The agreement allows
        iMergent to borrow up to $5 million at LIBOR plus 2 percent.

    Don Danks, chairman and chief executive officer, stated,
"iMergent's management team is extremely pleased with our record
financial growth, as well as our recent listing on the AMEX. We
believe listing gives us another avenue to reach out globally to
institutional investors who wish to participate in our growth. We look
forward to utilizing AMEX's tremendous resources to help maximize
shareholder value and increase the visibility of iMergent's future
achievements, as we strive to be the pre-eminent supplier of
e-commerce solutions to entrepreneurs and small business."
    Brandon Lewis, president and chief operating officer, said,
"During fiscal 2004, our record revenue and earnings prove we have
successfully executed our strategic plan to grow the business and
increase operating leverage. We have increased our sales team and its
reach, while maintaining the same corporate infrastructure.
Consequently, we were able to launch and then expand our international
marketing while raising our overall seminar profitability. In
addition, we adopted UPS Online Tools and began a marketing
partnership with MIT Financial. Following on the success of these
mutually beneficial relationships, we are working to develop
additional distribution channels and significant marketing
partnerships. In addition, we have established a number of new
programs to capture even more opportunities in our large and growing
market."
    Robert Lewis, chief financial officer, added, "We are implementing
programs to further raise sales productivity, leverage existing
infrastructure, reduce our bad debt expense and increase recurring
revenue. In addition to expanding our marketing resources, we continue
to augment our customer service and add affiliate programs. We expect
these initiatives to increase the number of activated merchant
websites, to further raise the value that every merchant brings to our
company and to further improve our financial performance."
