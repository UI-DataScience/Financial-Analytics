ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

         On August 31, 2004, Zale Corporation issued a press release reporting
its financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and year ended July 31,
2004. A copy of the press release is hereby furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and
incorporated herein by reference.

         The attached press release includes a presentation of earnings and
earnings per share, for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2003, that excludes
costs associated with redeeming the Company's senior notes in the fourth quarter
of fiscal year 2003. In addition, the attached press release includes a
presentation of earnings and earnings per share, for the fiscal year ended July
31, 2003, that excludes the senior note redemption costs as well as a non-cash
goodwill impairment charge incurred during the second quarter of fiscal year
2003. Such measures are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and
should not be considered as alternatives to net earnings and earnings per share
as computed under GAAP for the applicable period. The Company considers net
earnings and earnings per share to be the most comparable GAAP measures and has
presented reconciling information in the first and second paragraphs of the
press release.

         The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are
helpful, when presented in conjunction with the comparable GAAP measures.
Management uses earnings measures adjusted to exclude the charges as part of its
evaluation of the performance of the Company. Further, the Company believes
these measures provide useful information to investors because the charges
excluded relate to events that resulted in a significant impact during the
second and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2003 and will recur with unpredictable
frequency. Non-cash goodwill impairment charges may occur in the future, as the
Company reviews its goodwill each year under SFAS 142; however, such charges
will vary in size and frequency. Unusual financing charges, such as the costs
associated with redeeming the senior notes, occur more regularly in the
Company's business, but vary in size and frequency.

         In addition, the attached press release includes a presentation of
"free operating cash flow." Free operating cash flow is a non-GAAP financial
measure and is defined as cash flows from operating activities (in accordance
with GAAP) less net capital expenditures. The Company considers cash flows from
operating activities to be the most comparable GAAP financial measure, and has
included in the press release a reconciliation of cash flows from operating
activities to free operating cash flow.

         The Company believes the presentation of free operating cash flow
presents useful information about the amount of cash generated from operations
after making capital investments to support growth initiatives. Free operating
cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from
operating, financing or investing activities or as a measure of liquidity.
Further, free operating cash flow does not represent the total increase or
decrease in the cash balance for the period. Readers are encouraged to review
the Statement of Cash Flows included in the attached press release for
information regarding the Company's cash flows from operating, financing and
investing activities under GAAP.

         The information set forth under this Item 2.02 is being furnished and
shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by
reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as
shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

       Zale Announces 30 Percent Increase in Fourth Quarter and
   Full Year Earnings Per Share before Unusual Items from Prior Year

     DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 31, 2004--Zale Corporation
(NYSE:ZLC), North America's largest specialty retailer of fine
jewelry, reported today a 30% increase, before an unusual item in the
prior year, in net earnings per share for the Company's fourth quarter
ended July 31, 2004. The Company reported net earnings of $6.9
million, or $0.13 per diluted share. For the same period last year,
the Company reported net earnings, before costs associated with the
redemption of its Senior Notes, of $6.7 million, or $0.10 per diluted
share. Including last year's $3.7 million debt redemption charge
($0.06 per diluted share), the Company reported fourth quarter net
earnings of $2.9 million, or $0.05 per diluted share.
    Net earnings for fiscal year 2004 were $106.5 million, or $1.99
per diluted share. For the prior fiscal year, net earnings, before
unusual items, were $99.4 million, or $1.54 per diluted share.
Including last year's debt redemption costs of $3.7 million ($0.06 per
diluted share) and a $136.3 million non-cash impairment charge ($2.11
per diluted share), the net loss totaled $40.6 million, or $0.63 per
share.
    For the fiscal year, total revenues increased 4.2% to $2.304
billion, compared to $2.212 billion for the prior fiscal year. On a
comparable store basis, sales increased 3.9% for the year.
    "We are very pleased with these financial results for both the
fourth quarter and the fiscal year," commented Mary L. Forte,
President and Chief Executive Officer. "Earnings per share rose 30%
for the year while operating margins improved by 30 basis points. For
the third consecutive year we generated in excess of $100 million in
free operating cash flow as we generated $117 million in 2004 after
capital expenditures. We continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet
that provides substantial flexibility to pursue opportunities to
extend our market leadership."
    Ms. Forte continued, "We remain confident in the underlying
strength of our business as we execute our strategic plan. Our brand
management strategy has further differentiated each brand to capture
its segment of the market. Additionally, the recent investments we
have made are yielding long-term benefits, including the roll-out of
our direct sourcing efforts, the further building of our database
marketing capabilities and the development of our off-mall real estate
portfolio."
    The Company also provided its forecast for its fiscal year ending
July 2005. For the full year, it currently expects revenue growth of
5% to 7%, which includes a comparable store sales increase of 2% to
3%. The Company plans to open 85 stores and 50 kiosks during the year.
Operating margins are anticipated to increase 40 basis points with
earnings per share growing 12% to 14% for the year. Free operating
cash flow is again expected to reach $100 million for fiscal year
2005.
    As previously announced, a conference call will be held today at
9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Parties interested in participating should
dial 706-643-7467, five minutes prior to the scheduled start time. The
call is also available on the Company's Web site at www.zalecorp.com.

    Non-GAAP Financial Measures

    This press release includes a presentation of "free operating cash
flow" for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004. Free operating cash
flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as cash provided
by operating activities (in accordance with GAAP) less net capital
expenditures. The Company considers cash provided by operating
activities to be the most comparable GAAP financial measure, and has
included below a reconciliation of cash flows from operating
activities to free operating cash flow.


            Reconciliation of Free Operating Cash Flows To
                 Cash Provided by Operating Activities
                        (amounts in thousands)

                                   For the Fiscal Year Ended
                           July 31, 2004  July 31, 2003  July 31, 2002

Cash flows from operating
 activities                     $178,078       $164,820      $178,915

Less: Capital expenditures        60,788         43,579        54,159
                           -------------- -------------- -------------

Free operating cash flow        $117,290       $121,241      $124,756


    Free operating cash flow should not be considered as an
alternative to cash flows from operating, financing or investing
activities or as a measure of liquidity. Further, free operating cash
flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash
balance for the period. Readers are encouraged to review the Statement
of Cash Flows included in this press release for information regarding
the Company's cash flows from operating, financing and investing
activities under GAAP.
    In addition, management has presented a projection of free
operating cash flow of approximately $100 million for fiscal year
2005. This projection is based on projected cash provided by operating
activities of approximately $180 million for fiscal year 2005, less
projected net capital expenditures of approximately $80 million for
fiscal year 2005. Such projections represent management's current
expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual amounts to differ materially from these
projections. Please refer to the "Notice Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements" included in this press release.
    In addition, this press release includes a presentation of
earnings (and earnings per share), excluding certain unusual items
(Senior Notes redemption charges and a non-cash goodwill impairment
charge), for fiscal year 2003 and for the fourth quarter of fiscal
year 2003. Such measures are not measures of financial performance
under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net
earnings (and earnings per share) as computed under GAAP for the
applicable period. The impact of each unusual item is shown net of
taxes.
