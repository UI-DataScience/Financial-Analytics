                        LOEHMANN'S HOLDINGS INC. REPORTS

                           SECOND QUARTER 2004 RESULTS


BRONX, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--September 8, 2004--Loehmann's Holdings Inc.
(NASDAQ: LHMS) today announced financial results for the second quarter and six
month periods ended July 31, 2004.

For the second quarter ended July 31, 2004:

          o    Net sales increased 4.9% to $83.2 million compared to $79.3
               million in the second quarter of fiscal 2003;
          o    Comparable store sales increased by 2.1%;
          o    Net loss per diluted share decreased to $0.08 compared to a net
               loss per diluted share of $0.10 in the second quarter of fiscal
               2003; and
          o    EBITDA totaled $1.7 million compared to $1.5 million in the
               second quarter of fiscal 2003. Results for the quarter include
               $1.6 million of costs related to the previously announced pending
               merger. Without the merger related costs, EBITDA would have been
               $3.4 million.

Additionally, during the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company opened one
Loehmann's full line store and closed one full line store ending the quarter
with 48 stores in 17 states and the District of Columbia.

For the six months ended July 31, 2004:

          o    Net sales increased 12.1% to $190.2 million compared to $169.7
               million in the first half of fiscal 2003;
          o    Comparable store sales increased by 7.6%;
          o    Net income per diluted share increased to $0.62 compared to $0.28
               in the first half of fiscal 2003; and
          o    EBITDA totaled $13.1 million compared to $9.1 million in the
               first half of fiscal 2003. Results for the first half include
               $1.6 million of costs related to the pending merger. Without the
               merger related costs, EBITDA would have been $14.7 million.

         Robert N. Friedman, Chief Executive Officer, stated: "We are pleased
with our six months results, which demonstrate the success of our merchandising,
marketing and store expansion strategies."

(1) EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is
not a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) measurement, but is being
included, as we believe it is a commonly used measure of operating performance
in the retail industry. EBITDA is provided to enhance an investor's
understanding of our operating results. It should not be construed as an
alternative to operating income as an indicator of operating performance or as
an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity
as determined in accordance with GAAP. All companies do not calculate EBITDA in
the same manner. As a result, EBITDA as reported may not be comparable to EBITDA
as reported by other companies.
