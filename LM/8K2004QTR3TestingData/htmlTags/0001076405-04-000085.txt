                        THE PEPSI BOTTLING GROUP AFFIRMS
                      THIRD QUARTER 2004 EARNINGS GUIDANCE

     SOMERS,  N.Y.,  September 9, 2004 - The Pepsi Bottling  Group,  Inc. (NYSE:
PBG) today affirmed its earnings guidance for the third quarter 2004 of $0.67 to
$0.71 per share and full year 2004 of $1.68 to $1.74 per share.
     During the third quarter, which ended September 4, 2004, worldwide physical
case volume grew two percent on a constant territory basis. Physical case volume
grew one percent in the U.S.  and five  percent in Europe.  In Mexico,  physical
case volume grew three percent driven by a three percent  increase in carbonated
soft drinks,  18 percent increase in bottled water and two percent growth in jug
water.
     In the U.S.,  net revenue per case is  forecasted  to increase two to three
percent, consistent with the Company's previous guidance.
     PBG Chairman and Chief  Executive  Officer John T. Cahill said,  "Despite a
soft retail environment in the U.S. during the third quarter, we were pleased to
achieve volume growth,  while at the same time generating another quarter of net
revenue per case improvement."
     PBG plans to  release  its  complete  third  quarter  results  on  Tuesday,
September 28, 2004.
     The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc. is the world's largest manufacturer,  seller
and  distributor of Pepsi-Cola  beverages with  operations in the U.S.,  Canada,
