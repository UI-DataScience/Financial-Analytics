               ISSI Revises Guidance for September 2004 Quarter

              Schedules Quarterly Conference Call for October 28

    SANTA CLARA, Calif., Sept. 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Integrated Silicon
Solution, Inc. (Nasdaq: ISSI), announced today that it expects its revenue and
earnings for the September 2004 quarter will be lower than the Company's
previous guidance provided on July 22, 2004.  The Company now expects that
revenue for the September 2004 quarter will be in the range of approximately
$30 million to $33 million.  Further, the Company expects to report a loss for
the quarter.

    "The quarter began with a combination of too much inventory in the channel
and a seasonal slow down.  We needed a strong second half of the quarter and
it just has not materialized," said Jimmy Lee, Chairman and CEO.  "Because of
the slow down, average selling prices for our lower density SDRAMs have
dropped substantially from last quarter.  This decline has hurt top line
revenue and squeezed gross margins.  As a result, we will post a loss for the
quarter."

    ISSI has scheduled its regularly held quarterly conference call for
Thursday, October 28, 2004 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time to discuss the company's
financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2004.  To access ISSI's
conference call via telephone, dial 719-457-2692 by 1:20 p.m. Pacific time on
October 28.  If you plan to participate in the call, please RSVP either by
telephone at 408-969-4774, or by email to ir@issi.com.  The call will be
webcast from ISSI's website at www.issi.com.  No separate conference call will
be held in conjunction with today's release.
