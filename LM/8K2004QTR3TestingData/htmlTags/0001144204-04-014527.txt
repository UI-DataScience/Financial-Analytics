               NETSOL TECHNOLOGIES INC. REPORTS FINANCIAL RESULTS
                            FOR YEAR-END FISCAL 2004

 AGGRESSIVE MARKETING AND SALES EFFORTS DRIVE ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH 54 PERCENT
          FOR FISCAL 2004, GUIDANCE FOR FISCAL 2005 REVENUES INCREASED
                         FROM $9 MILLION TO $10 MILLION

CALABASAS, CA - September 15, 2004 - NETSOL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (NASDAQ:NTWK), a
developer of proprietary software applications and provider of information
technology (IT) services, today reported revenues for its fiscal year ended June
30, 2004, of $5.8 million, with a net loss of $2.9 million, or a loss per
weighted average share of ($0.38), as compared to revenues of $3.7 million with
a net loss of $2.1 million, or a loss per weighted average share of ($0.58) for
fiscal 2003. Gross profit for the year ended June 30, 2004, increased to $3.1
million, or 53.7 percent gross profit margin, as compared to gross profit
margins of $ 1.9 million, or 52.5 percent gross profit margin for fiscal 2003.
The company ended the year with approximately $1.3 million in cash and cash
equivalents, as compared to $214,490 at year end fiscal 2003.

"We are very pleased to report meeting our guidance for 2004 by exceeding 50
percent top line growth," said Naeem Ghauri, Chief Executive Officer for NetSol.
"The 54 percent annual revenue growth was marked by an increased demand for
LeaseSoft, along with expanding markets both domestically and abroad for IT
services, consulting, and ISP-related products and services."

The company's primary subsidiary, NetSol Technology (Pvt) Ltd., reported a
record 140 percent growth in revenue to $3.2 million, with a net profit of $1.5
million for year ended June 30, 2004. This compares with revenues of $1.3
million and net profit of approximately $39,000 for the previous year ended June
30, 2003.

"Over the past six months," continued Ghauri, "we initiated aggressive worldwide
marketing and sales campaigns aimed at driving organic growth, including the
addition of several new senior sales professionals in our Asia Pacific, United
Kingdom and Pakistan offices. This new focus, along with a continued emphasis on
tightened financial controls and streamlined operations, has helped us track
toward projected profitability by the second quarter of 2005, and significant
revenue growth as high as $10 million by year end."

Fourth Quarter Highlights:

      o     DaimlerChrysler signed global LeaseSoft frame contract

      o     Australian Motor Finance Pty. Ltd. signed potential multi-million
            dollar revenue sharing agreement for new POS software solution

      o     Company raised $2.05 million in new financing for investment in
            technology infrastructure and global business development

      o     Launched expanded beta testing program for Pearl Treasury System

      o     NetSol IT Village opened, named a Software Technology Park by
            Pakistan government

      o     Company signed six additional development contracts

      o     Launched worldwide marketing and direct sales campaigns

      o     For the quarter ended June 30, 2004, revenue increased 52% to $1.87
            million, compared to $1.23 million in the comparable quarter of
            2003;

      o     Net loss for the quarter, ended June 30, 2004, grew to $ 1.13
            million , up from $416,000 in the fourth quarter of 2003, due to
            mostly non-cash expenses

The company reported a net EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation,
and amortization) loss of $1.2 million for fiscal 2004, compared to an EBITDA
loss of $560,616 for fiscal 2003. "Financial results for both the fourth quarter
and year-end met our expectations," said NetSol Chairman Najeeb U. Ghauri. "The
increase in the loss from operations was due to significant one-time charges
associated with activities undertaken to provide the foundation for dramatic
future growth."

One-time extraordinary operating expenses included:

1)    The relocation of more than 250 employees to NetSol's newly-opened
      Technology Park facility, as well as the moving of its East Coast and U.K.
      offices in the fourth quarter;

2)    Increased general and administrative expenses for new hires in sales,
      marketing, software development, corporate, quality control, and legal;

3)    Approximately $400,000 in non-cash charges for the issuance of warrants in
      fees;

4)    Legal, accounting, and administrative expenses for due-diligence
      activities related to Silicon Space, the company's acquisition candidate,
      which was abandoned; and

5)    Public entity costs including proxies along with compliance on new
      procedures associated with Sarbanes-Oxley Act, such as the formation of
      new committees, changes in board personnel, and technology and processes
      related to internal and external financial reporting.

Ghauri went on to note that several extraordinary expenses will benefit the
company moving forward, including a $150,000 per year rent savings with the new
Lahore facility, established processes and procedures in place to comply with
the Sarbanes Oxley Act and related SEC filings, and the addition of personnel in
revenue-generating functional areas versus operational and administrative.

"We are extremely pleased with our year-to-date results," said Naeem Ghauri. "We
have not only continued to make tremendous strides in firming up our technology
infrastructure to form a base from which to spur future growth, but our
increased front line sales and marketing efforts have already driven significant
revenue this year, including contracts with Fortune 500 companies, such as
Toyota and Daimler Chrysler. Additionally, these campaigns are already providing
a strong pipeline for the coming year."

"Given our strong pipeline and recent industry growth forecasts, we are
confident in continued returns from our core IT consulting and services
business," commented Ghauri. "Additionally, with the expansion into new market
niches, including insurance, increased demand for ISP products and services, and
global recognition of LeaseSoft as a premiere software solution, we are well
positioned to achieve our guidance estimates for 2005."

According to a recent report from International Data Corporation (IDC), the
worldwide IT services market is forecasted to grow to $707.3 billion by 2007, at
a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7 percent.

"We anticipate 2005 to be a breakout year, not only for NetSol proper, but for
our subsidiaries as well," continued Ghauri. "This past year marked the end of
our investment period. Moving forward, we anticipate that all our subsidiaries,
including our Lahore facility and NetSol Akhter, should shift from cost centers
to stand alone profit centers. The ISP-services market in Pakistan is an
extremely hot sector, and NetSol-Akhter is projecting more than 40 percent
growth. While we have posted record earnings in one key subsidiary, we are
confident 2005 will be a year for across-the-board profitability and sustainable
top line growth."

As in the prior fiscal year, our auditors have included an emphasis paragraph on
going concern in their opinion.
