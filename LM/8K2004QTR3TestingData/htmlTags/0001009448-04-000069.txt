Lyndhurst, NJ - On September 15, 2004, Harvey Electronics, Inc. ("Harvey
Electronics", "Harvey" or the "Company". NASDAQ SmallCap Market symbol: "HRVE")
announced the profitable third quarter and nine months results ended July 31,
2004. The prior fiscal year, 2003, was a fifty-three week year as compared to
fifty-two weeks for fiscal 2004. As a result, the Company's first quarter of
fiscal 2004 included thirteen weeks as compared to fourteen weeks for the same
quarter in fiscal 2003.

The Company's pre-tax income for the thirty-nine weeks ended July 31, 2004
increased approximately 23.8% to $786,000 from $635,000 for the forty weeks
ended August 2, 2003. Net income for the thirty-nine weeks ended July 31, 2004
increased approximately 36.6% to $526,000 from $385,000 for the forty weeks
ended August 2, 2003.

The Company's pre-tax income for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 increased to
$60,000 from $23,000 for the same quarter last year. Net income for the third
quarter of fiscal 2004 increased to $90,000, after a $30,000 tax benefit, as
compared to $13,000 for the same quarter last year.

For the thirty-nine weeks ended July 31, 2004, Earnings before interest taxes,
depreciation and amortization, ("EBITDA") aggregated $1,439,000, as compared to
$1,479,000 for the forty weeks ended August 2, 2003. (EBITDA for the first nine
months of 2004 was calculated as follows: pre-tax income of $786,000, plus
interest of $150,000 and depreciation and amortization of $503,000. EBITDA for
the first nine months of fiscal 2003 was calculated as follows: pre-tax income
of $635,000, plus interest of $263,000 and depreciation and amortization of
$581,000).

For the third quarter of fiscal 2004, EBITDA aggregated $269,000 as compared to
$303,000 for the same quarter last year. (EBITDA for the third quarter of fiscal
2004 is calculated as follows: pre-tax income of $60,000 plus interest of
$39,000 and depreciation and amortization of $170,000. EBITDA for the third
quarter of fiscal 2003 is calculated as follows: pre-tax income of $23,000 plus
interest of $88,000 and depreciation and amortization of $192,000).

As previously reported, net sales for the third quarter ended July 31, 2004,
aggregated $10,043,000, an increase of $137,000 or 1.4% from the same quarter
last year. Comparable store sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 increased
approximately $195,000 or 2% from the same quarter last year.

For the thirty-nine weeks ended July 31, 2004, net sales aggregated $32,785,000
and remained consistent with net sales for the forty weeks ended August 2, 2003.
It is important to note that fiscal 2003 was a fifty-three week year, as the
first quarter of fiscal 2003 included fourteen weeks. As a result, comparable
store sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended July 31, 2004 increased
approximately $991,000 or 3.1% from the same period last year.

Mr. Franklin Karp, President of Harvey Electronics stated, "Our third quarter
and nine month results were stronger than anticipated. Comparable store sales,
our strong gross profit margin and our pre-tax income for the nine month period
all increased from the prior year."

"Plasma, LCD and micro-display flat panel televisions, as well as the Company's
professional custom installation services continued to drive our business in the
third quarter. However, we are also pleased to see increases in our higher
margin audio business for the second quarter in a row, as we have better
demonstrated and bundled the sale of these products with the video products
driving the industry."

Mr. Karp continued, "Our overall gross profit margin of over 41% continues to be
strong, due to the increase in sales of higher margin accessories, extended
warranties, labor, and an 8% increase in our profitable custom installation
business. Continued improvement of these sales categories continues to be a
major focus for Harvey."

Mr. Joseph Calabrese, Chief Financial Officer noted "It is important to note
that while the Company recorded an income tax equivalent provision of $260,000
for the nine months ended July 31, 2004, this provision will not materially
affect the Company's ultimate tax liability as Harvey is utilizing net operating
loss carryforwards. As a result, we believe pre-tax income and EBITDA are key
financial measurements of our Company's operations and performance."

Mr. Calabrese concluded, "Comparable selling, general and administrative
expenses for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 have increased 2.6% as
compared to the same period last year, demonstrating the Company's ability to
control expenses, despite the rising costs associated with our personnel and
occupancy. I am also pleased to report a 43% decline in interest expense for the
first nine months of fiscal 2004, due primarily from reduced borrowings and
lower costs relating to our new credit facility."

Mr. Karp concluded, "We plan to continue to hire additional personnel to support
the planned expansion of our custom installation initiatives. These services are
profitable for Harvey and differentiate us in the market. We are excited about
the new service initiatives and additionally by the new Harvey showroom in
Bridgewater, New Jersey, which is expected to open in early 2005. We are
optimistic about the fourth quarter and the overall results of fiscal 2004."
