relating to fiscal 2005 first quarter results. A copy of the press release is
attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

Item 2.05  Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

     (a) On September 28, 2004, the Company's Board of Directors approved
management's plan, developed in late September 2004, that is designed to enhance
the Company's operating effectiveness and profitability. Under the plan, the
Company will centralize structure, consolidate leadership and reduce long-term
costs to realign projected expenses with anticipated revenue levels. The plan
includes a reduction of approximately 100 employees in the United States and the
United Kingdom, which will result in a charge for severance and related benefits
of approximately $2.5 million in the second quarter ending November 30, 2004.
The reduction includes employees who work in operations, marketing, sales,
research and development, support and services. All terminations and related
payments are expected to be completed during fiscal 2005. Management of the
Company is continuing to evaluate other cost reduction opportunities that may
result in additional charges in the second quarter ending November 30, 2004 and
during the remainder of fiscal 2005. Because management has not completed its
evaluation and plan, the nature, amount and timing of any additional charges are
not currently determinable.

             Lawson Software Reports First Quarter FY05 Results and
                          Announces Restructuring Plan

    ST. PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 30, 2004--Lawson Software,
Inc. (Nasdaq:LWSN) today reported total revenues of $82.7 million for
its fiscal 2005 first quarter ended Aug. 31, 2004, compared with
revenues of $88.0 million for its fiscal 2004 first quarter. License
fee revenues were $13.3 million in the fiscal 2005 first quarter,
compared with $22.7 million in the fiscal 2004 first quarter. Services
revenues were $69.4 million in the fiscal 2005 first quarter, compared
with $65.3 million in the fiscal 2004 first quarter.
    On a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, the
company recorded a net loss of $417,000, or $0.00 per diluted share,
in the fiscal 2005 first quarter, compared with net income of $3.2
million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the fiscal 2004 first quarter.
    Based on non-GAAP financial measures, the company reported
non-GAAP net income of $916,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the
fiscal 2005 first quarter, compared with non-GAAP net income of $4.0
million in the fiscal 2004 first quarter, or $0.04 per diluted share.
Fiscal 2005 first quarter non-GAAP operating results exclude $2.1
million of items consisting of software and intangible amortization
related to acquisitions and acquired maintenance contracts, non-cash
stock-based compensation and a restructuring charge adjustment.
    For the details on the company's GAAP reported results and the
reconciliation of GAAP operating results to non-GAAP financial
measures of net income, see the financial table accompanying this news
release - "SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - RECONCILIATION OF GAAP OPERATING
(LOSS) INCOME TO NON-GAAP NET INCOME."
    The company signed 122 deals in the quarter. Of total contracting
activity in the fiscal 2005 first quarter, 65 percent came from
existing customers and 35 percent from new customers. During the
quarter, the company signed 12 new customers at an average selling
price of $428,000, compared with 19 new customers at an average
selling price of $730,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.
    The company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
were $184.5 million at Aug. 31, 2004, compared with $209.0 million at
May 31, 2004.
    Days sales outstanding were 61, compared with 59 in the fiscal
2004 fourth quarter.
    Deferred revenue and client deposits decreased $18.2 million from
the prior quarter, primarily because of a decrease in cash received on
support billings as a result of a change in client billing cycles and
other delayed collections. The change resulted in initially smaller
client invoices due to pro-rated billings in an effort to get
individual multiple client support billings to a common renewal date.
Deferred revenue levels impacted by this change are expected to be
restored in subsequent periods during this fiscal year as billing
cycles become synchronized and cash is collected.
    The company also announced a plan designed to enhance operating
effectiveness and profitability. Under the plan, the company will
centralize structure, consolidate leadership and reduce long-term
costs to realign projected expenses with anticipated revenue levels.
The plan includes a reduction of approximately 100 employees in the
United States and the United Kingdom, which will result in a charge of
approximately $2.5 million in the second quarter ending Nov. 30, 2004.
The reduction includes employees who work in operations, marketing,
sales, research and development, support and services. All
terminations and related payments are expected to be completed during
fiscal 2005. The company is continuing to evaluate other cost
reduction opportunities that may result in additional charges in the
second quarter ending Nov. 30, 2004, and during the remainder of
fiscal 2005. Because management has not completed its evaluation and
plan, the nature, amount and timing of any additional charges are not
currently determinable.
    "Despite our disappointment in the level of license fees in our
first quarter, we are pleased that we were able to minimize the impact
on our earnings per share," said Jay Coughlan, Lawson president and
chief executive officer. "There is a strong opportunity for Lawson as
a key enterprise application software provider in today's environment.
We remain committed to our vertical strategy and will focus on the
continued verticalization of our products to deliver greater value to
our clients. We also continue to make the appropriate investments in
our growth, even as we improve our efficiencies by managing our costs
and expenses."

  SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - RECONCILIATION OF GAAP OPERATING (LOSS)
               INCOME TO NON-GAAP NET INCOME (UNAUDITED)
                 (in thousands, except per share data)

Lawson provides non-GAAP results as supplemental information to GAAP
operating results. These non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses and
non-cash charges such as software and intangible amortization related
to acquisitions and acquired maintenance contracts, non-cash
stock-based compensation and restructuring. Lawson believes that this
presentation facilitates comparison by investors, analysts, and others
of our operating results with other companies in our peer group as
well as to Lawson's historical results. Management uses non-GAAP
operating results to evaluate short-term and long-term operating
trends in Lawson's core software operations. Non-GAAP operating
results are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be
considered a substitute for or an alternative to operating results
determined in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial
measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by
other companies. The following table reconciles the GAAP operating
results to non-GAAP net income.

Notes:

(1) This amount relates to acquired maintenance contracts intangible
    amortization from Siemens Medical Solutions Services Corporation,
    which is recorded in cost of services. Management believes that
    the operating margins derived from providing maintenance services
    for the acquired clients are comparable to its other maintenance
    clients. If the amortization were included, the margins on
    acquired contracts would be considerably less than the maintenance
    margins on existing clients.

                                                                    Exhibit 99.2

         Lawson Centralizes Sales, Services with Executive Appointments;
 Company Aims to Improve Efficiency and Effectiveness and Increase Client Focus

    ST. PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 30, 2004---Lawson
Software, Inc. (Nasdaq:LWSN) today announced it is centralizing its
sales and services operations under new executive positions reporting
to CEO Jay Coughlan. The company named Joanne Byrd to the new position
of executive vice president of sales and said it expects to name an
executive vice president of services in the next few weeks.
Centralizing sales and services is aimed at improving the company's
efficiency and effectiveness in these areas and follows the company's
June announcement of its new leadership structure to support its
"Manifesto for Change" and increase client focus.
    In the new leadership structure, Coughlan's direct reports now
include Bob Barbieri, chief financial and performance officer; Dean
Hager, chief product officer; Scott Meyer, chief marketing and human
resources officer; Bruce McPheeters, chief legal officer; Byrd, EVP of
sales, and the EVP of services, to be named.
    Coughlan said the new reporting structure provides clear
accountability and responsibility for the company's three sources of
revenue - licensing fees, maintenance fees and consulting services.
The new, more centralized structure also consolidates leadership for
market identification and development, demand creation and the
financial controls, human resources and support functions required to
enhance the company's operating effectiveness and profitability.
    "We remain committed to our vertical strategy and are making these
changes to strengthen our ability to participate profitably in a
challenging and competitive business applications marketplace," said
Coughlan. "As we said when we unveiled our manifesto for change and
our 1,000-day plan in June, the first phase of this effort would
include refining our business and organizational model to strengthen
our ability to achieve our goals. The current environment for business
applications providers favors those companies with strong client
relationships, proven solutions for client challenges and solid
financial performance. I'm confident the changes we are making in our
organizational structure will help us continually improve in all three
areas."
    As part of the changes, Eric Morgan, executive vice president -
Healthcare, and Sam Adams, senior vice president - Government and
Education, have announced their departures from Lawson and will be
transitioning out of the company over the next several weeks. "Eric
and Sam have played key roles in Lawson's growth over the years and we
wish them the best in their new pursuits," said Coughlan.
