Item 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

On September 23, 2004, Golden  Enterprises issued a press release (the "Earnings
Press  Release")  announcing its earnings for the First quarter ended August 31,
2004.  A copy of the Earnings  Press  Release is attached as Exhibit  99.1.  The
Earnings Press Release is incorporated herein by Reference.

(a.) Golden  Enterprises,  Inc.'s Board of Directors  today declared a quarterly
     dividend of $.03125 per share payable  October 27, 2004 to  stockholders of
     record on October 8, 2004.

     For the three  months ended August 31,  2004,  Golden  Enterprises,  Inc.'s
     basic and diluted  earnings per share were $.02  compared to $.04 last year
     (restated), on net sales of $24,766,426 versus $24,580,778, 1% increase.

     During the first  quarter,  gross margins  increased  $.15 million,  or 1%,
     compared to the prior year quarter,  as gains from  improved  manufacturing
     efficiencies  more than offset net  unfavorable  raw material and packaging
     costs.

     Selling,  general and administrative expenses increased $.59 million, or 5%
     during the first quarter ended August 31, 2004. This increase was primarily
     in selling and delivery expenses and employee benefit costs.

     Management will continue to explore ways to manage our rising fuel cost and
     other increasing commodities.

     The  following is a summary of sales and income  information  for the three
     months ended August 31, 2004 and 2003.
