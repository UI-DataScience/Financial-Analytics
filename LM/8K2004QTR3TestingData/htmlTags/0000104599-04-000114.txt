Second Quarter and Year-to-Date Summary
Sales.  Total sales for the second quarter ended August 31, 2004,  increased 8.8
percent to $2.35 billion from $2.16 billion for the second  quarter ended August
31, 2003, with comparable store merchandise sales increasing 2.9 percent.  Total
sales for this year's second  quarter  include  domestic  segment sales of $2.23
billion and international  segment sales of $117.8 million. The domestic segment
sales  include  credit  revenues of $6.6  million  generated  through an ongoing
arrangement under which Chase Card Services offers  private-label and co-branded
credit cards to Circuit City customers in the United States.

Total sales for the six months ended August 31, 2004,  increased  7.9 percent to
$4.41  billion from $4.09  billion in the first half of last fiscal  year,  with
comparable store merchandise sales increasing 4.5 percent.  Total sales for this
year's first six months  include  domestic  segment  sales of $4.27  billion and
international segment sales of $139.5 million.

Neither the arrangement with Chase Card Services nor the  international  segment
was in place for Circuit  City last  fiscal  year.  Prior to this year's  second
quarter,  private-label  and co-branded credit cards were made available through
Circuit  City's wholly owned  subsidiary,  First North  American  National Bank.
Private-label  and co-branded  finance income generated  through that subsidiary
was reported as finance income on the consolidated statements of operations. The
international  segment  consists of the  operations  of  InterTAN,  Inc.,  which
Circuit City acquired in May 2004, and thus,  comparable store merchandise sales
for the  current  fiscal  year's  second  quarter and first six months and total
sales for the same periods of last fiscal year reflect domestic sales only.

Net Loss from  Continuing  Operations.  The fiscal 2005 second  quarter net loss
from continuing operations totaled $11.4 million, or 6 cents per share, compared
with a net loss from  continuing  operations of $39.3  million,  or 19 cents per
share,  for the  second  quarter of fiscal  2004.  The  international  segment's
results  reduced  the  fiscal  2005  second  quarter  net loss  from  continuing
operations by $3.4 million, or 2 cents per share.

The net loss from  continuing  operations  for the six months  ended  August 31,
2004, totaled $16.7 million, or 8 cents per share, compared with a net loss from
continuing  operations  of $67.4  million,  or 33 cents per share,  for the same
period last year. The international  segment's results reduced the net loss from
continuing  operations  for the first six months of fiscal 2005 by $3.8 million,
or 2 cents per share.

Net Sales and Operating Revenues
"We believe year-over-year improvements in average tickets and extended warranty
penetration  rates  for  key  merchandise   classes  are  indicative  of  better
store-level execution," said W. Alan McCollough,  chairman,  president and chief
executive  officer of Circuit  City Stores,  Inc.  "During the first half of the
year, we have continued to refine our store designs,  merchandise  offerings and
store staffing to help ensure that we deliver an exceptional  in-store  consumer
electronics shopping experience during the upcoming holidays. Equally important,
we, just last week, launched our next-generation Web site,  circuitcity.com,  to
take our standard-setting online shopping experience to the next level."

Extended  warranty  revenues  were as follows  for the second  quarter of fiscal
years 2005 and 2004:

(a) Calculations exclude  international segment sales and operating revenues and
international segment extended warranty revenue.

</TABLE>


The company's  relocated  stores also continue to generate  attractive  returns.
Since the  initiation  of Circuit  City's  store  revitalization  program at the
beginning  of fiscal 2001  through the end of this year's  second  quarter,  the
company has  relocated  48 stores,  of which 31 have been open for more than six
months.  In their first full six months  following  grand opening,  these stores
have averaged sales that were approximately 25 percentage points better than the
sales pace of the  remainder  of the store base during the same time periods and
an internal rate of return of approximately 15 percent. The company continues to
anticipate that, as stores are added to the relocation base, the average results
from relocated stores will vary.

Gross Profit Margin
The gross profit  margin was 24.6 percent in the second  quarter of fiscal 2005,
compared with 22.6 percent in the same period last fiscal year. The inclusion of
the international  segment's revenues and cost of sales,  buying and warehousing
contributed  77 basis points to this year's second  quarter gross profit margin.
The change in the gross  profit  margin of the  domestic  segment  reflects  the
increase in extended  warranty  sales,  which carry  higher than  average  gross
profit margins;  the increased  efficiency of the company's  product service and
distribution  operations;  and the inclusion of credit revenues in the company's
net sales and operating revenues.  The inclusion of credit revenues  contributed
23 basis points to this year's second quarter gross profit margin.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses were 25.0 percent of total sales in
the second  quarter of this fiscal  year,  compared  with 25.3  percent of total
sales in the same period last year. The inclusion of the international segment's
revenues and selling,  general and administrative expenses increased this year's
second  quarter   expense-to-sales   ratio  by  49  basis  points.  This  year's
improvement in the domestic  segment's  expense to sales ratio includes leverage
from the comparable  store sales growth; a reduction in rent and occupancy costs
as a percent of sales,  largely resulting from the closure of 19 underperforming
stores at the end of last fiscal  year;  lower  payroll  and fringes  costs as a
percent of sales; and lower  relocation and remodel expense,  which reflects the
large number of stores that were refixtured in last year's second quarter. These
reductions were partly offset by increases in advertising expenses.

</TABLE>

Circuit City currently  expects to open  approximately 60 Superstores,  of which
slightly less than half would be  relocations,  in fiscal 2005.  The company has
signed  leases on all the sites it expects to open this fiscal year and plans to
open   approximately  30  of  the  stores  in  this  year's  third  quarter  and
approximately  16 in the fourth quarter.  Circuit City now anticipates  that its
capital expenditures,  net of sale-leasebacks and tenant improvement allowances,
for its domestic and international  segments  combined will total  approximately
$155 million in the current  fiscal year and that  expenses  related to domestic
store relocations and one remodel will total approximately $47 million in fiscal
2005.  Through the first six months,  the company has incurred 39 percent of the
anticipated  remodel and  relocation  expenses.  Circuit  City  expects to incur
approximately  $17  million in remodel  and  relocation  expense in the  quarter
ending November 30, 2004.

Stock-based Compensation Expense
Stock-based  compensation expense was $8.4 million in the second quarter of this
fiscal year,  compared  with $12.1  million in the same period last fiscal year.
The  company  estimates  that  stock-based   compensation   expense  will  total
approximately $7 million in each of the remaining quarters of the fiscal year.

Net Loss from Discontinued Operations
Discontinued operations include the company's bankcard operation, which was sold
to  FleetBoston  Financial in November  2003. A  transition  services  agreement
remained in effect  through April 2, 2004.  For the second  quarter ended August
31, 2004, the after-tax loss from the discontinued  bankcard  operation  totaled
$507,000 and reflected post-closing adjustments related to the sale.

Financial Condition
On August 31, 2004,  Circuit City had cash and cash  equivalents of $954 million
compared with $633 million at August 31, 2003. The year-over-year  change in the
cash  balance  reflects  the net cash  proceeds  from the sale of the  company's
finance operations,  partly offset by acquisition costs for InterTAN, Inc. Since
the end of the second  quarter of fiscal  2004,  the company  also has used $211
million  to  repurchase   common  stock  under  the   company's   stock  buyback
authorization.

A $52 million decrease in accounts receivable primarily reflects the elimination
of $86 million in  receivables  related to the  company's  former  private-label
finance  operation,  partly  offset by the  addition  of $26 million of InterTAN
accounts receivable.

Merchandise  inventory  rose to $1.64  billion  at August 31,  2004,  from $1.55
billion at August 31, 2003.  The increase  includes  InterTAN  inventory of $106
million.

Goodwill and other intangible  assets of $240 million at August 31, 2004, relate
to the company's purchases of InterTAN and MusicNow.

An  increase  of $44  million  in other  liabilities  includes  $17  million  of
InterTAN-related other liabilities.
