                 ESI Announces Fiscal 2005 First Quarter Results

    PORTLAND, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 23, 2004--Electro
Scientific Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq:ESIO) today announced results for
its fiscal 2005 first quarter ended August 28, 2004.
    First quarter sales were $72.6 million, down 11% compared to
fourth quarter sales of $81.8 million and up 248% compared to prior
year first quarter sales of $20.9 million. Operating income for the
quarter was $15.4 million, compared with operating income of $16.8
million in the fourth quarter and an operating loss of $15.5 million
in the first quarter a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $10.6
million, or $0.38 per basic share and $0.36 per diluted share,
compared with net income of $16.2 million, or $0.57 per basic share
and $0.54 per diluted share in the fourth quarter and a net loss of
$9.4 million, or $0.34 per basic and diluted share in the first
quarter a year ago.
    Net orders for the first quarter were $67.6 million, a decrease of
35% compared with $104.7 million in the fourth quarter and an increase
of 58% compared with $42.7 million in the first quarter of 2004.
Backlog decreased to $68.2 million at August 28, 2004 compared to
$78.5 million at May 29, 2004. Deferred revenue increased this quarter
to $17.2 million compared to $12.0 million at May 29, 2004.
    "Overall, the company executed well in a challenging environment,"
noted Nick Konidaris, ESI's president and chief executive officer.
"Despite a decrease in demand, we were able to achieve our target
operating model of 50% gross margins, 30% operating expense, and 20%
operating income. A few customers have delayed orders; however
industry utilization rates remain high and orders are not being
cancelled. We believe the current decrease in industry demand will
facilitate an inventory rationalization."
    Konidaris continued, "The sequential order rate decreased in each
of our three businesses, indicative of the broad-based cautiousness in
the industry. We continued to meet our delivery requirements as
shipments remained strong, increasing 1% over the fourth quarter.
Despite the increase in shipments, revenues were down 11% sequentially
as our deferred revenue balance increased during the quarter."
    Mike Dodson, ESI's chief financial officer added, "Gross margins
of 51% during the quarter were down from 53% in the fourth quarter.
Fourth quarter margins benefited 3% from the sale of inventory that
had been previously reserved. Excluding this benefit, first quarter
margins were up 1% from the fourth quarter, representing the sixth
consecutive quarter of margin improvement. Operating expenses were $21
million in the quarter, down from $27 million in the fourth quarter.
Excluding the $4 million settlement for the class action lawsuit
charged in the fourth quarter, operating expenses were down $2 million
from the fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower
variable selling expenses related to the decrease in revenues as well
as lower research and development due to the timing of project
expenses."
    "Our balance sheet remains strong. Cash and investments were $337
million at the end of the quarter, up $4 million from the fourth
quarter. The increase was primarily due to our strong operating
performance," concluded Dodson.
    Konidaris added, "There is very little visibility in the current
environment. However, we believe demand will decrease for at least
another quarter. As a result, we expect order volume in the second
quarter to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million. Consistent
with the decrease in the order forecast, we believe second quarter
shipments and revenues will be in the range of $60 million to $70
million. We plan to manage our margins and operating expenses in
accordance with our target operating model."
    The company will hold a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern
Time. The session will include a review of the financial results,
operational performance, business outlook, and a question and answer
period.
    The conference call can be accessed by calling 800-374-2470
(domestic participants) or 706-634-5108 (international participants).
A live audio webcast can be accessed at www.esi.com. Upon completion

at 800-642-1687 (domestic participants) or 706-645-9291 (international
participants), with conference ID number 6325191. The audio replay
