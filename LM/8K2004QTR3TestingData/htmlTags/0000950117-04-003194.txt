                       REX STORES' SECOND QUARTER DILUTED
                     EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASE 4% TO $0.26

Dayton, Ohio (September 2, 2004) -- REX Stores Corporation (NYSE:RSC), a
specialty retailer of consumer electronic products and appliances, today
announced financial results and comparable store sales for the three- and
six-month periods ended July 31, 2004.

Net income in the three months ended July 31, 2004 rose 4% to $3.3 million, or
$0.26 per diluted share, from net income of $3.2 million, or $0.25 per diluted
share, in the three months ended July 31, 2003. Net income for the 2004 period
reflects an income tax benefit of $1.4 million due to the June 2004 successful
completion of an Internal Revenue Service examination related to the Company's
Section 29 income tax credits for certain years. Net income for the 2004 period
also reflects a $0.6 million pre-tax loss on the early termination of debt. Per
share results are based on 12,854,000 and 12,626,000 diluted weighted average
shares outstanding for the three-month periods ending July 31, 2004 and July 31,
2003, respectively.

Net sales in the three months ended July 31, 2004 fell 2% to $88.4 million from
$90.2 million in the three months ended July 31, 2003. Comparable store sales
during the period were flat compared to the same year-ago period. Excluding air
conditioners, which can represent a significant portion of the Company's fiscal
second quarter sales, comparable store sales would have risen 4%. The Company
reports sales performance quarterly and considers a store to be comparable after
it has been open six full fiscal quarters. Comparable store sales figures do not
include sales of extended service contracts.

During the three-month period ended July 31, 2004, REX purchased approximately

available to purchase under its previously announced stock buy-back
authorization.

Net income in the six-month period ended July 31, 2004 rose 17% to $7.4 million,
or $0.57 per diluted share, compared to net income of $6.3 million, or $0.50 per
diluted share, in the six-month period ended July 31, 2003. Per share results
are based on 12,925,000 and 12,567,000 diluted weighted average shares
outstanding for the six-month periods ending July 31, 2004 and July 31, 2003.
Net sales in the 2004 six-month period were $175.6 million compared $184.2
million in the six months ended July 31, 2003, while comparable store sales
fell 4%.
