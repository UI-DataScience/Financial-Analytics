    Publishing Highlights - Third Quarter

    Rockstar's new title Red Dead Revolver, released in late April for
PlayStation 2 and Xbox, was a significant contributor to third quarter
results. Designed by Rockstar San Diego, the developers of Rockstar
Games' successful Midnight Club and Smuggler's Run franchises, Red
Dead Revolver was the top-performing product in Take-Two's publishing
business this quarter and was a top ten title in the United States in
May, June and July according to NPDFunworld(SM). Rockstar's Grand
Theft Auto: Vice City was released in Japan for the PlayStation 2 and
PC in late May, under a license agreement with Capcom Co., Ltd.
According to Media Create Co., Ltd., a leading market research firm
covering the Japanese console gaming market, the PlayStation 2 title
has sold over 400,000 copies as of the week ended August 29, 2004,
making it one of the most successful debuts of a Western video game in
Japan.
    Rockstar also launched the PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits versions of
Midnight Club 2 and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, bringing Take-Two's
catalog of Greatest Hits products for PlayStation 2 to eight titles.
    Global Star launched ESPN NFL 2K5 for both the PlayStation 2 and
Xbox in North America at the end of July, the first title released
under the co-publishing and exclusive distribution agreement with Sega
Corporation for the ESPN Videogames sports titles. Global Star also
shipped Army Men: Sarge's War and Dragon Tales.
    To streamline Take-Two's publishing operations, the Company is
reorganizing its publishing business into two labels: Rockstar Games
and Global Star Software. Rockstar will continue to focus on premium
priced, groundbreaking entertainment, while Global Star's portfolio
will be significantly broadened. In addition to publishing the ESPN
Videogames sports line and all value priced titles, Global Star will
publish both premium and value priced licensed properties, as well as
the products that were formerly under the Company's Gathering label.

    Publishing Highlights - Fourth Quarter

    Take-Two has an extensive product lineup planned this holiday
season, beginning in the fourth quarter. Rockstar will introduce Grand
Theft Auto: San Andreas, the next iteration in the globally successful
franchise which has sold over 32 million units. Developed by
world-class designers Rockstar North, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas
will be available exclusively for the PlayStation 2 and is expected to
be in stores in North America on October 26, 2004 and in Europe on
October 29, 2004. The title's launch date was moved to allow
additional time for final testing of the game, which exceeds the size,
depth and scope of traditional videogames. Rockstar has been
extensively previewing the game to the trade press, and the title has
appeared on the cover of several key trade publications since it was
revealed to the public at this year's E3 industry tradeshow. Rockstar
also plans to release an extension of the Grand Theft Auto franchise
for the Game Boy Advance in late October.
    Global Star's fourth quarter line-up leads with ESPN NHL 2K5 for
both the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, which is in North American retail
stores now. Later this quarter Global Star will release ESPN NBA 2K5,
also for PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Other fourth quarter releases include
Conflict: Vietnam, the next game in the successful Conflict series, to
be distributed in North America on the PlayStation 2, Xbox and PC;
Kohan II: Kings of War for PC; Robotech: Invasion and Outlaw Golf 2
for PlayStation 2 and Xbox; and a Game Boy Advance title based on
Cartoon Network's hit series Codename: Kids Next Door. Gathering's
product lineup for the fourth quarter includes Wings of War for the
Xbox and PC; and The Guy Game for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, which are
all in retail stores now; and Vietcong: Purple Haze for PlayStation 2
and Xbox.

    Future Publishing Highlights

    Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition, the third installment in the
multi-million unit selling, genre-defining Midnight Club racing
franchise developed by Rockstar San Diego, is planned for release on
PlayStation 2 and Xbox in January 2005. The Warriors(TM), a new title
based on the Paramount Pictures feature film, is scheduled for launch
on PlayStation 2 in April 2005. Additional products planned for fiscal
2005 from Rockstar Games include Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas for PC
in the third quarter, as well as two new console titles based on
proven brands from Rockstar's internal studios, in the third and
fourth quarters. Rockstar also plans to release Grand Theft Auto: San
Andreas in Japan in fiscal 2005.
    Global Star's fiscal 2005 lineup includes the full line of ESPN
Videogames sports titles, beginning with ESPN College Hoops in the
first quarter, followed by ESPN Major League Baseball in the second
quarter.
    As recently announced, Global Star will be introducing videogame
and PC titles based on the Warner Bros. Pictures film, Charlie and the
Chocolate Factory, directed by Tim Burton and starring Oscar nominated
actor Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. The launch of the videogames is
scheduled to coincide with the Summer 2005 release of the feature
film.
    Other products planned for fiscal 2005 release by Global Star
include Close Combat: First to Fight for Xbox and PC; Dora The
Explorer: Super Star Adventures for Game Boy Advance; Stronghold 2 for
PC; Ford Mustang: 40th Anniversary Edition for PlayStation 2 and Xbox;
a deluxe version of Outlaw Volleyball for the PlayStation 2 featuring
new content and enhancements to the franchise; and console versions of
Codename: Kids Next Door, Spy vs. Spy, Motocross Mania 3 and Outlaw
Tennis.

    Distribution Highlights

    The Company's Jack of All Games subsidiary, the leading North
American distributor of videogame software, continues to capitalize on
the growing installed base of hardware and proliferation of software
titles and outlets to purchase software. Jack emphasizes sales of both
exclusive and non-exclusive mid- and budget-priced software and serves
as the exclusive distributor for all of Global Star's value-priced
products.

    Management

    During the quarter, Take-Two added two new executives to its
management team and appointed a new member to its Board of Directors.
Sam Judd joined as Senior Vice President, Planning and Administration,
where he oversees business planning, strategy development and
information technology. Mr. Judd spent the past 11 years at Viacom

manufacturing and supply chain functions for the Simon & Schuster
division, a global publishing business. Mr. Judd's prior experience

several years at PepsiCo Inc. in corporate and divisional financial
positions and finance roles with IBM.
    David Messenger joined as Senior Vice President, Human Resources.
Prior to joining Take-Two, Mr. Messenger was leading Towers Perrin's
change management practice. He has extensive experience in human
resources strategy and operations, compensation and performance
management, mergers and acquisitions, organization design and
leadership development. Mr. Messenger's clients included Universal

    As previously announced, Barbara A. Kaczynski was appointed as a
director of the Company in July. Ms. Kaczynski chairs Take-Two's Audit
Committee and is considered a financial expert as defined by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Ms. Kaczynski was most recently
Chief Financial Officer of the National Football League (NFL), where
she directed the operations of the finance, treasury, budgeting,
planning, internal audit and information technology organizations of
the NFL. Prior to the NFL, Ms. Kaczynski held several senior financial
positions at various companies, including the position of Vice
President of Finance and Controller for Time, Inc., where she spent
almost 10 years.

    Management Comments

    Richard W. Roedel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
commented, "We are pleased with the progress we have made in building
and diversifying our product portfolio through the introduction of
several new Rockstar brands and the launch of the ESPN sports titles.
Our product pipeline going into 2005, which includes titles based on
proven franchises, new brands and licensed properties, is one of the
strongest in the Company's history. Combined with the expansion of our
management team and the strengthening of our internal operations, we
believe we are building the foundation for long term, sustained
growth. As a result, we are confident that the continued execution of
our business strategy will enable Take-Two to maintain a leadership
position in the interactive entertainment industry and lead to an even
stronger financial position going forward."
