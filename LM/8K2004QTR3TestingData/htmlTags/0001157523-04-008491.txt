Volt Information Sciences Reports Increased Third Quarter Earnings

    NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 14, 2004--Volt Information
Sciences, Inc. (NYSE:VOL) today reported financial results for the
Company's third quarter and nine months ended August 1, 2004.
    Volt will conduct a conference call webcast at 11:00 A.M. (EDT)
today to discuss third quarter results. The conference call dial-in
number is 1-800-857-0373 (domestic) or 1-773-756-4602 (international),
passcode: Third Quarter. The conference call will be broadcast live
over the Internet and can be accessed for the next 30 days at
http://www.volt.com/investor/press_release.cfm.
    The following is a summary of the Company's results of operations
and the notes thereto. The notes are an integral part of the summary.

    THIRD QUARTER - FISCAL 2004 RESULTS

    For the third quarter ended August 1, 2004, the Company reported
net income of $9.2 million, or $0.60 per share, on net sales of $500.7
million, compared to net income of $2.1 million, or $0.14 per share,
for the comparable quarter of the previous year, on net sales of
$415.2 million.

    NINE MONTHS - FISCAL 2004 RESULTS

    For the first nine months of fiscal 2004, the Company reported a
net income of $21.5 million, or $1.40 per share, on net sales of $1.4
billion, compared to a net loss of $2.1 million, or $0.14 per share,
on net sales of $1.2 billion last year, for the comparable nine months
of the previous year.
    The Company reported income from continuing operations of $12.0
million, or $0.78 per share, in the nine months ended August 1, 2004
compared to a loss from continuing operations of $2.1 million, or
$0.14 per share in the comparable fiscal 2003 period. The results of
the first nine months of fiscal 2004 included income from discontinued
operations, net of taxes, of $9.5 million, or $0.62 per share, from
the sale of real estate previously leased to the Company's formerly
59% owned subsidiary, Autologic Information International, Inc. The
Company's interest in the subsidiary was sold in November 2001.
    "This has been an exciting quarter for Volt," commented William
Shaw, President and Chairman of the Company. "The extremely strong
performance, both in increased sales and operating profit, as well as
the acquisition of Nortel's directory and operator services business
for our Computer Systems segment, is a continuation of the material
improvement and momentum of the Company's operations during the entire
year," stated Mr. Shaw. "Three of our four segments contributed to the
twenty-one percent increase in sales and the two hundred and
forty-seven percent increase in operating profit compared with the
2003 third quarter." "I am particularly pleased", continued Mr. Shaw,
"that our operating profit growth rate throughout the year has
significantly exceeded the growth in sales."

    STAFFING SERVICES

    Both the Technical Placement division and the Administrative and
Industrial division of this segment contributed to the 20% increase in
sales and 131% increase in the segment's operating profit on a
comparable quarter basis. The Administrative and Industrial division
returned to profitability, with a six-hundred thousand dollar
operating profit compared to a two million dollar loss in the
comparable fiscal 2003 quarter. This improvement resulted from both a
31% increase in sales and a 0.9 percentage point increase in gross
margin. Gains were shown both in temporary and permanent placement
business of the division. The increase in gross margin occurred even
though payroll taxes have increased, as previously noted.
    The Technical Placement division's increase from the prior year's
third quarter in operating profit of 56% also resulted from both an
increase in sales, both in traditional placement and in the project
management and consulting business, and an increase in gross margins
of 23%. Sales for this division increased by 15% compared to the 2003
third quarter.

    COMPUTER SYSTEMS

    Improvements in this segment's operator service business, a growth
in DataServ's directory service business with non-telco companies, an
increase in sales in the Maintech division and an increase in product
revenue of 22% resulted in a 154% increase in operating profit from
the 2003 comparable quarter. In addition, there was an increase in
gross margins of 10.7 percentage points and a 4.4 percentage points
decrease in overhead as a percentage of sales. Of the $5.5 million
increase in operating profit, $1.2 million resulted from the
settlement of a vendor dispute and vendor refunds related to prior
periods.
    As previously noted in a press release of August 2, Volt Delta
Resources LLC, the principal business unit of this segment, acquired
certain assets and liabilities of the directory and operator services
business of Nortel Networks on August 2. This acquisition will permit
Volt Delta to provide the newly combined customer base with new
solutions, and an expanded suite of products, content and enhanced
services.

    TELEPHONE DIRECTORY

    Operating profit for this segment decreased by $1.5 million
compared to the 2003 comparable quarter, primarily the result of a
$1.5 million sales decline in the segment's Telephone Directory
Production division, due to a previously reported loss of a major
contract, and a $1.6 million decline in revenue from the segment's
Uruguayan operations. The operating loss of these two divisions was
partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in the operating profit of
DataNational, the publisher of community directories.

    TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES

    A strong performance by the Business Systems and Construction and
Engineering divisions of this segment more than offset continued
losses in the Central Office division and returned the segment to
profitability for the quarter. Sales increased 50% and overhead was
reduced to 20% of sales. This produced an operating profit of $1.0
million for the quarter. However, the depressed condition of the
telecommunications industry continues to reduce available work and
puts extreme pressure on gross margins, which declined in the quarter
compared to last year.

    GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSES

    General corporate expenses increased by $0.7 million compared with
the third quarter of 2003, primarily the result of increased spending
for professional fees and corporate systems.

    LIQUIDITY

    Cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, decreased to
$34.3 million at August 1, 2004 from $43.2 million at November 2,
2003. At August 1, 2004, the Company had sold a continuing
participating interest in accounts receivable of $60.0 million under
its securitization program, an increase of $10.0 million from the end
of the second quarter, and had the ability to finance up to an
additional $90.0 million under the facility.
    The Company may also borrow under its $30.0 million revolving
secured credit facility, which is limited by a specific borrowing
base. At the end of the third quarter, $26.6 million was available
under the borrowing base. The Company had borrowed 2.0 million British
pounds ($3.6 million) at August 1, 2004 under the $30.0 million
revolving secured credit facility.

                            (Notes Follow)

Note A - The results of discontinued operations reflect the sale
         of real estate, in the second quarter of 2004, previously
         leased by the Company to its former 59% owned subsidiary,
         Autologic Information International, Inc., which interest
         was sold in November 2001. The cash transaction resulted in a
         $9.5 million gain, net of taxes of $4.6 million.

     B - Under certain contracts with customers, the Company manages
         the customers' alternative staffing requirements, including
         transactions between the customer and other staffing vendors
         ("associate vendors"). When payments to associate vendors are
         subject to the receipt of the customers' payment to the
         Company, the arrangements are considered non-recourse against
         the Company and revenue, other than management fees to the
         Company, is excluded from sales. Cash restricted to cover
         such obligations is included in cash and cash equivalents on
         the August 1, 2004 and November 2, 2003 balance sheets.

     C - Under an accounts receivable securitization program, the
         Company, through a 100%-owned consolidated special purpose
         subsidiary, sold a participation interest of $60.0 million
         out of pool approximating $229.5 million of receivables to an
         unaffiliated third party. The outstanding balance of the
         participation interest sold at November 2, 2003 was $70.0
         million. Accordingly, the trade receivables included on the
         August 1, 2004 and November 2, 2003 balance sheets have been
         reduced to reflect the $60.0 million and $70.0 million
         participation interest sold, respectively.
