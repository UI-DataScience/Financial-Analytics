ROCKLIN,  Calif.,  --  September  9,  2004--  International  DisplayWorks,  Inc.
(OTC/BB:  IDWK), a  manufacturer  and  distributor  of liquid  crystal  displays
(LCDs),  modules  and  assemblies,  today  announced  financial  results for the
Company's  third quarter and nine-month  period of fiscal 2004, the period ended
July 31, 2004.

Third Quarter Highlights:
     o  Net income of $370,000 or $0.01 per share
     o  Operating income of $444,000 vs. loss in Q3 2003
     o  Revenues  for  the quarter  increased  97.9  percent  to a  record $11.7
        million
     o  Revenue  for  nine  months  increased  104.3  percent  to  $32.1 million
     o  Company   completes  quarter  with  $20.7  million   in  cash  and  cash
        equivalents

For the third quarter, revenues were a record $11.7 million, an increase of 97.9
percent  compared to the $5.9 million  reported for the third  quarter of fiscal
2003. The Company's gross profit increased 86.5 percent to $2.4 million compared
to a gross profit of $1.3 million for the same period a year ago.  Gross margins
were 20.9 percent  compared to 22.2 percent for the fiscal third quarter of last
year.  Operating  expenses for the quarter  were $2.0  million  compared to $1.5
million in the year ago period as the Company grew sales at three times the rate
of growth in  operating  expenses.  Operating  expenses  as a percent of revenue
decreased  to 17.1  percent  for the third  quarter  of 2004,  compared  to 26.2
percent for last year's third quarter.  The Company reported operating income of
$444,000,  compared to an operating  loss of $238,000 for the same period a year
ago. Net income was $370,000,  or $0.01 per diluted  share,  compared with a net
loss of $314,000, or $0.02 per diluted share last year. The fully diluted shares
outstanding were 32,192,938  million as of the third quarter of 2004 compared to
19,318,246 million as of the end of the third quarter of 2003.

For the nine-month period, revenues were $32.1 million, a 104.3 percent increase
compared to the $15.7  million  reported for the first nine months of 2003.  The
gross profit increased 87.2 percent to $7.0 million compared to $3.7 million for
the first nine months of 2003. Gross margins for the first nine months were 21.8
percent compared to 23.7 percent in the year ago period.  The operating expenses
for the nine-month period were $5.5 million, a 24.6 percent increase compared to
the $4.4 million reported for the first nine months of 2003.  Operating expenses
as a percent of revenues were 17.3 percent compared to 28.3 percent for the same
period a year  ago.  The  Company  reported  operating  income  of $1.4  million
compared to a loss from  operations  of $718,000  last year.  Net income for the
nine-month  period was $543,000,  or $0.02 per diluted share,  compared to a net
loss of $918,000, or $0.05 per share last year.

"We have  clearly made  substantial  progress in  executing  our business  plan,
doubling  sales of monochrome  displays while  carefully  managing our operating
expenses,  and  the  result  has  been  continued   profitability  and  improved
shareholder  value,"  commented  Steve  Kircher,   chief  executive  officer  of
International  DisplayWorks,  Inc.  "Our  efforts  have yielded a diverse mix of
large  customers  and  an  improved  competitive  position,   which  will  prove
beneficial as we complete our entry into the color display market.  I am pleased
with the results year to date, and look forward to continuing this momentum into
our next fiscal year as we become a recognized  leader in  producing  both color
and monochrome displays for a wide variety of markets."

"We are  actively  working to complete  the  installation  of the  equipment  we
purchased in June for the  manufacturing  and assembly of color  displays,"  Mr.
Kircher continued.  "We recently signed a lease for a new manufacturing facility
near our current campus in China which will provide the necessary  space for the
new CSTN  manufacturing  line. We anticipate  the equipment will be in place for
initial runs by the middle of October,  thus  allowing us to produce  prototypes
for customer  qualification,  with mass  production  projected by the end of the
fiscal  first  quarter.  We also  expect  to have  our  TFT  assembly  equipment
installed and we will be accepting orders for production in November."

The Company  completed  the third  quarter with a  strengthened  balance  sheet,
reporting  $20.7 million in cash and cash  equivalents,  an increase of 18 times
compared  to the $1.2  million  reported  as of October  31,  2003.  The Company
finished the quarter with a current ratio of 2.77 to 1. Management  believes the
Company is adequately capitalized to execute its business plan, which at optimum
product mix has the capacity to generate over $500 million in annual  production
given current selling prices for color displays.  However,  the Company does not
expect that annual production will approach this level in fiscal 2005.

Management  will  discuss  the results in a  conference  call today at 4:15 p.m.
