                     URSTADT BIDDLE PROPERTIES INC. REPORTS
               FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004

         GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT, September 9, 2004 - Urstadt Biddle Properties
Inc. (NYSE:UBA and UBP), a real estate investment trust, today announced its
financial results for the three months and nine months ended July 31, 2004.

Net income applicable to Common and Class A Common stockholders for the quarter
was $4,154,000 or $0.15 per diluted Common share and $0.17 per diluted Class A
Common share, compared to $4,527,000, or $0.17 per diluted Common share and
$0.19 per diluted Class A Common share in the corresponding three month period
last year. Funds from operations (diluted) "FFO" for the quarter ended July 31,
2004 was $7,074,000 or $0.26 per diluted Common share and $0.28 per diluted
Class A Common share compared to $7,283,000 or $0.27 per diluted Common share
and $.30 per diluted Class A Common share in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.

For the nine months ended July 31, 2004, net income applicable to Common and
Class A Common stockholders was $13,917,000 or $0.52 per diluted Common share
and $0.57 per diluted Class A Common share compared to $12,920,000 or $0.48 per
diluted Common share and $0.54 per diluted Class A Common share for the same
period last year. FFO for the nine months ended July 31, 2004 increased to
$22,514,000 or $0.82 per Common share and $0.90 per Class A Common share from
$20,792,000 or $0.76 per diluted Common share and $0.84 per diluted Class A
Common share for the same period in fiscal 2003.

A reconciliation of FFO to net income applicable to Common and Class A Common
stockholders, the GAAP measure the Company believes to be the most directly
comparable, is in the financial tables accompanying this press release.

At the end of the third quarter, the gross leasable area (GLA) of the Company's
core properties were approximately 98% leased, an increase of approximately 1%
since the beginning of the fiscal year and unchanged since the second quarter of
2004. The Company leased or renewed 236,000 square feet of space in the first
nine months of the year.

Commenting on the quarter's results, Willing L. Biddle, President and Chief
Operating Officer of UBP, said "We continue to improve the quality of our
shopping center portfolio through aggressive leasing and management of our
properties. Demand for retail space is strong in our markets, however we
continue to be challenged by vacancies in our non-core office property in
Southfield, Michigan caused by a weak office leasing market."

During the third quarter of 2004, the Company acquired four properties totaling
38,000 square feet at an aggregate cost of approximately $11 million and assumed
$4.7 million in mortgage loans in connection with the acquisitions. In September
2004, the Company entered into a contract to purchase a shopping center
containing approximately 250,000 square feet of leasable space located in its
target acquisition market for approximately $50 million. The contract to
purchase is subject to various conditions, including customary closing
conditions, and therefore, there can be no assurance as to when or if the
transaction will be completed.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
Funds from Operations ("FFO")

The Company reports Funds from Operations ("FFO") in addition to its net income
applicable to common stockholders and net cash provided by operating activities.
The Company has adopted the definition suggested by The National Association of
Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") and defines FFO to mean net income
(computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of
property, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization , and after
adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures.

The Company considers FFO a meaningful, additional measure of operating
performance because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the
real estate assets diminishes predictably over time and industry analysts have
accepted it as a performance measure. FFO is presented to assist investors in
analyzing the operating performance of the Company. It is helpful as it excludes
various items included in the net income that are not indicators of the
Company's operating performance, such as gains (or losses) from sales of
property and depreciation and amortization. However, FFO:
|X|  does not represent cash flows from operating  activities in accordance with
     GAAP  (which,   unlike  FFO,   generally   reflects  all  cash  effects  of
     transactions and other events in the determination of net income) and;
|X|  should not be considered an  alternative  to net income as an indication of
     our performance.
FFO, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled items reported
by other real estate investment trusts due to possible differences in the
application of the NAREIT definition as used by such REITs.

UBP is a self-administered equity real estate trust providing investors with a
means of participating in ownership of income-producing properties with
investment liquidity. UBP has paid 139 quarters of uninterrupted dividends since
its inception in 1969.

Certain statements contained herein may constitute "forward-looking statements"
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such
forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of

achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such
factors include, among other things, risks associated with the timing of and
costs associated with property improvements, financing commitments and general
competitive factors.
