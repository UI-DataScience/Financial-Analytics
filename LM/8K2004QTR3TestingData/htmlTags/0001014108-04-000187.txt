                    Quest Resource Corporation Annual Report
                              for Fiscal Year 2004

Energy Production  Company,  LP and Tall Grass Gas Services,  LLC (collectively,
"Devon") on December 22, 2003 for a total consideration of $126 million, subject
to certain purchase price adjustments. At the time of acquisition,  the acquired
assets had  approximately  95.9 Bcfe of estimated proved reserves,  91.7 Bcfe of
estimated probable reserves and 72.2 Bcfe of estimated  possible  reserves.  The
assets included  approximately  372,000 gross (366,000 net) acres of natural gas

pipelines.  At the time of  acquisition,  the Devon  assets  were  producing  an

*2 EBITDA,  which is Earnings before  interest,  income taxes and  depreciation,
depletion and amortization  expense,  is presented because it is used by us, and
we believe it is  frequently  used by securities  analysts,  investors and other
interested  parties,  in addition to and not in lieu of GAAP results, to compare
the  performance  of  companies.  EBITDA  is  not  a  measurement  of  financial
performance  under generally  accepted  accounting  principles and should not be
considered  as an  alternative  to cash flow from  operating  activities or as a
measure  of  liquidity  or an  alternative  to net income as  indicators  of our
operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. The following is a reconciliation

*3 In Quest's financial  statements  included in Form 10-KSB for the fiscal year
ended May 31, 2004;  Weighted Average Shares Outstanding  Diluted for the fiscal
years ended May 31, 2004 and 2003 were 15,570,462 and 11,298,019,  respectively.
The numbers reflected in the table  take into account the effect of  outstanding
warrants,  convertible  debentures,  and  convertible  preferred stock that were
excluded in computing Net Loss Per Share,  because their effect was non-diluting
due to the net loss.

Comments On Financial and Operating Data

Quest's annual net production grew to approximately 5.5 million mcf, an increase
of 272% over the prior year's production of approximately 1.5 million mcf. Total
Revenues and Operating Income for fiscal 2004 were approximately  $30.0 million,
and $9.5 million,  respectively.  These are substantial increases over the Total
Revenues of  approximately  $8.1 million and Operating  Income of  approximately
$2.4 million for Fiscal 2003.

Proven Reserves

Net proven reserves of approximately 133.6 million mcfe for Fiscal 2004 exceeded
net proven  reserves of  approximately  28.3 million mcfe for 2003 by 372%.  The
proven  reserve  estimates  were prepared by the petroleum  engineering  firm of
Cawley,  Gillespie,  and  Associates,  Inc.  of Ft.  Worth,  TX. The 2004 proven
reserve  estimate  places a present value of the future net cash flow discounted
at 10% at approximately $318.4 million.

Management Comments

The significant  increase in net production and net proven reserves  reflect the
magnitude of growth  accomplished by Quest through its strategic  acquisition of
Devon's Cherokee Basin producing wells and pipeline network,  and the aggressive
new well drilling and completion  program that is still active.  The Company has
accelerated  its  development  plans by  establishing  a new well  drilling  and
completion target of 1,140 wells for the next three years.  Management  believes
that Quest has the experienced  employee base and development assets in place to
accomplish this increased pace of development.

Quest's primary activity is the exploration,  production,  and transportation of
natural  gas  in  a  1,000  square  mile  region  of  southeastern   Kansas  and
northeastern  Oklahoma that is served by its 900 mile gas pipeline network.  For
more  information,  contact Mr. Jim Vin Zant at  316-788-1545 or visit the Quest
website at www.qrcp.net.

historical  fact,  are  forward  looking   statements  that  involve  risks  and
uncertainties. Forward-looking statements in this announcement are made pursuant
to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995.   Although  Quest  believes  that  the  expectations   reflected  in  such
forward-looking  statements are  reasonable,  it can give no assurance that such
expectations will prove to be correct.  Actual results may differ materially due
to a variety of factors,  including without limitation: the uncertainty involved
in exploring for and  developing  new natural gas  reserves,  the sale prices of
natural gas and oil,  environmental  issues,  weather  conditions,  competition,
general market  conditions,  and other risks  detailed in the Company's  filings
with the Securities and Exchange  Commission.  You can find Quest's filings with
the Securities and Exchange  Commission at www.qrcp.net  or at  www.sec.gov.  By
