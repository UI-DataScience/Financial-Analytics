FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
MONDAY AUGUST 16, 2004


                         TRANS-INDUSTRIES, INC. REPORTS
                    2004 SECOND-QUARTER AND SIX-MONTH RESULTS

ROCHESTER HILLS, MICHIGAN -- AUGUST 16, 2004 - TRANS-INDUSTRIES, INC. (NASDAQ:
TRNI), a manufacturer of bus lighting systems and information display products,
announced results for the second quarter and six months ending June 30, 2004.

Sales were $7.7 million for the quarter. This represented a decline of 9.9
percent from sales of $8.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003.
This decline was concentrated in the lighting products business segment and
resulted primarily from a decrease in the level of bus production from that of
the previous year. Moreover, in the current quarter, the Company shipped a
limited number of luggage lofts, which have higher dollar content per bus than
regular lighting products. While sales of digital information products improved,
such sales were insufficient to offset the decrease in lighting shipments noted
above. These same factors resulted in a sales decrease of $2.0 million, or 11.4
percent, to $15.2 million for the current period from $17.2 million for the
six-month period ended June 30, 2003.

A loss of $2.6 million was incurred for the quarter, consisting of $344,000 from
operations in addition to $2.3 million from the establishment of an additional
inventory reserve. This inventory reserve resulted from several factors that
impacted the Company's operations during the quarter. In early March, management
changes were effected including the appointment of a new President and Chief
Operating Officer. The Company's existing product offerings were analyzed and
some have been curtailed, and personnel has been further reduced, thereby
reducing product absorption. In light of a decline in sales during the second
quarter and the changed business direction, it was determined a portion of the
inventory would not be used going forward. Cost reduction opportunities
continued to be emphasized with formal programs initiated in all cost segments.

<PAGE>




However, savings from these programs are not expected to be realized in full
until later in the year as legacy costs in the form of severance payments
continued throughout the quarter.

The Company believes its system for purchasing materials, particularly in the
digital information systems operation, improved in the period as better
utilization of the material requirements production system initiated last year
provided needed information for enhanced scheduling against available inventory.

The Company has been operating under a forbearance agreement with Comerica Bank,
its present lender until January 2005. Efforts to locate another lender to
replace the Comerica credit have been ongoing and the Company anticipates
finalizing credit arrangements with a new lender by September 1, 2004.

ABOUT THE COMPANY:
The Company is a leading provider of lighting systems and related components to
the mass transit market as well as a supplier of information hardware and
software solutions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and mass transit
projects. ITS utilizes integrated networks of electronic sensors, signs and
software to monitor road conditions, communicate information to drivers and help
transportation authorities better manage traffic flow across their existing
infrastructures.

Forward-Looking Statements:
Except for statements of historical fact, this news release contains certain
forward-looking statements about the Company. Such statements are subject to
significant risks and uncertainties including changes in economic and market
conditions, management of growth, and other risks noted in the Company's SEC
filings, which may cause actual results to differ materially. We have used words
such as "may," "will," "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "plan,"
"intend," and similar expressions in this press release to identify
forward-looking statements. The Company's actual results may differ from those
set forth in such statements. Significant changes in economic conditions,
regulatory or legislative changes affecting Trans-Industries, Inc., its
competitors, or the markets in which it is active, or changes in other factors
may cause future results to vary from those expected by the Company. The Company
believes any forward-looking statements it has made are based on current
management expectations and they are subject to risks and uncertainties. These
risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to the following:

     -    The potential inability to close the refinancing of the Company's bank
          debt;

     -    The continued forbearance by the Company's bank lender of their right
          to call the debt now due;

     -    A further decline of economic conditions in general and in the mass
          transit industry in particular;

     -    Changes in customer requirements or reduced demand for the Company's
          products and services;

     -    The inability of the Company to successfully implement its
          restructuring program in the informational systems business;


     -    Competitive factors (including the introduction or enhancement of
          competitive products and their successful introduction into the
          marketplace);

     -    Product pricing decreased and component price increases that may
          result in materially reduced gross profit margins for the Company's
          product;

     -    Unforeseen increases in operating expenses;

     -    The inability to attract or retain management, sales, or engineering
          talent; and

     -    The success of management's decision to change the business direction.
