FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS

     This Form 8-K and other reports filed by Registrant  from time to time with
the Securities and Exchange  Commission  (collectively the "Filings") contain or
may contain  forward  looking  statements  and  information  that are based upon
beliefs of, and information  currently available to, Registrant's  management as
well as estimates and assumptions made by Registrant's management.  When used in
the filings the words "anticipate",  "believe",  "estimate", "expect", "future",
"intend",  "plan" or the negative of these terms and similar expressions as they
relate  to  Registrant  or  Registrant's  management  identify  forward  looking
statements.  Such statements reflect the current view of Registrant with respect
to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties,  assumptions and other
factors relating to Registrant's industry,  Registrant's  operations and results
of operations and any businesses that may be acquired by Registrant.  Should one
or more of these risks or  uncertainties  materialize,  or should the underlying
assumptions prove incorrect,  actual results may differ significantly from those
anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended or planned.

     Although Registrant believes that the expectations reflected in the forward
looking  statements are reasonable,  Registrant cannot guarantee future results,
levels  of  activity,  performance  or  achievements.   Except  as  required  by
applicable law,  including the securities laws of the United States,  Registrant
does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these
statements to actual results.

ITEM 2.01.  COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.

The  following  discussion  is provided  solely for the purpose of correcting an
error in  Registrant's  Amendment No. 1 to the Current  Report on Form 8-K filed
with the commission on August 20, 2004 (the "Prior Report").

In the  discussion  under Item 2 under the heading  "Intellectual  Properties"on
page 6 of the Prior  Report and under the  heading  "Certain  Relationships  and
Related  Transactions,"  on page 17 of the Prior Report,  the Registrant  stated
that "SDTD and SDID has a royalty  free  license to use 2 Canadian  patents from
Imperial Canadian Overseas Capital Corporation ("ICOC").  Mr. Ian Cheng Yi Feng,
President and C.E.O of SDID, is a shareholder  and director of ICOC. The license
expires in December, 2011." These statements are erroneous.

The Registrant  wishes to clarify both the content and the errors in translation
from Chinese to English as follows:

Mr. Ian Cheng Yi Feng  first  explored  energy  savings  software  in 1999 for a
Canadian company called Imperial Canadian Overseas Capital Corporation ("ICOC").
ICOC  then  sold and  transferred  the  initial  software  technology  it had to
Shenzhen Baobo Industrial (now SDTD) pursuant to a Technology Transfer Agreement
dated December 2001 for  consideration  of RMB$2 million.  This is a transfer of
technology,  not patent.  This agreement provided for a termination in December,
2011.  This agreement was  subsequently  amended on January 3, 2003 to eliminate
the  termination  date and  changed  the  term to  permanently  effective.  This
agreement  also  provides  that  SDTD has the  right  to  further  develop  this
technology to create its own  intellectual  properties and SDTD has the right to
transfer,  trade,  use and make it SDTD's  patent.  ICOC  further  declares  and
undertakes in this  agreement that it has never applied and will never apply for
any patent covering the initial software technology in any countries.

With this  technology,  SDTD put together the  technicians  and  programmers and
developed  the chip set that is the heart of the  intelligence  control  circuit

                                       2

board Switching System used in Starway's products. Subsequently, Mr. Cheng Ming,
a shareholder and director of SDTD,  applied for a patent in China covering this
technology in April, 2003 and was granted preliminary  approval of the patent by
the Chinese intellectual property agency on September 19, 2003. All rights under
such  patent were then  transferred  to SDTD by Mr.  Cheng Ming on December  19,
2003.

ITEM 2.02.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

On August 23, 2004, the  Registrant  announced its results for the quarter ended
June 30, 2004. A copy of the press release is attached as an exhibit.

In addition, the Registrant wishes to clarify errors in translation in the press
release from Chinese to English.  The press release  erroneously stated that the
results were audited. The results,  however, were not in fact audited but merely
reviewed by the Registrant's auditors. Further, the press release stated that on
August 25, 2004,  the  Registrant  was to issue a convertible  note.  Such note,
however,  has  already  been issued and what was to occur on August 25, 2004 was
the conversion of such note into common stock of the Registrant.

ITEM 3.02.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

On August 25, 2004, the Company issued 11,451,336 shares of common stock, in the
aggregate, to EuroFaith Holdings, Inc.'s assignees and 3 individuals pursuant to
a conversion of outstanding  convertible notes held by EuroFaith Holdings,  Inc.
and the 3 individuals.  This  transaction was effected under Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended and  appropriate  legends were affixed to the
share certificate and other instruments issued in such transaction.

UPDATE ON ACQUISITION OF ENERGY SAVINGS PROJECT IN CHINA BY RIM HOLDINGS
Monday August 23, 9:53 am ET

NEW YORK,  Aug. 23  /Xinhua-PRNewswire-FirstCall/  -- Rim  Holdings,  Inc.  (OTC
Bulletin  Board:  RIMI  -  NEWS)  announced  today  that  it has  completed  due
diligence,  audit and consolidation of accounts in respect of the acquisition of
50% stake in Starway.  The following actions are scheduled to be taken by August
25, 2004.

    *  Change of name of Rim to China Energy Savings Technology, Inc
    *  Change of trading symbol from RIMI to CEST
    *  20 for 1 reverse stock split
    *  Issuance of $120 million convertible promissory note eligible for
       conversion of 11,153,669 shares post reverse split) of Rim for closing
       the 50% Starway deal.

Starway holds 100% interest in Shenzhen Dicken  Industrial  Development  Limited
("SDID"). The core business of SDID is the development,  manufacture and sale of
energy  savings  products in China.  All the energy  savings  products have been
patented  in  China.  Due  diligence  has  been  completed  by Rim on the  above
acquisition.  SDID  products  and energy  saving  technology  are leading in the
industry.  Different  from other  products found in the market that are hardware
for  stabilizing  the voltage,  SDID  products  are  composed of smart  chipsets
developed by  technicians  and  programmers  from Canada and China over the last
four years. The chipsets are used to form the new component,  "Smart Module", an
intelligence  circuit control board. Used with hardware,  the Smart Module helps
stabilize the voltage. The savings is then 2 times other products in the market,
ranging  from 28% to 34% and even  reaches 60% in some cases.  As spurred by the
record  high oil  prices  around  the  globe and the coal  price in China,  both
resources are in excess  demand.  Together with the economic wheel of China kept
turning  rapidly,  the energy crisis in China can hardly be resolved in the next
few years. The only solution that Chinese government has is energy savings. This
explains why SDID's products are widely used and highly recommended  amongst the
Chinese authorities. The products have obtained government awards of achievement
and  relevant  certificates.  In order to further  enhance  its  energy  savings
business,  SDID  contemplate  investing and  developing a wind energy project in
Xinjiang  Province,  China  by  the  end  of  2004.  The  project  has  obtained
preliminary  approval of Xinjiang  government and is enjoying  taxation and land
use privileges.

In view of the above,  the net profit of Starway of 2002 since  commencement  of
business  of SDID is $1.79  million and that of 2003 is $8.9  million.  From the
audited  management  account,  the net  profit  for the  first 6 months  of 2004
reached  $13.1  million.  The estimated net profit for the year 2004 will exceed
$26  million.  The PE ratio  will be 14 basing on the total  outstanding  shares
after the stock split and the closing  price $0.75 of Rim as at August 20, 2004.
The net profit is on the rise for the coming years.
