FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
- ---------------------


       NU HORIZONS REPORTS FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE SECOND
                          QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2005


MELVILLE, NY, September 30, 2004 --- Nu Horizons Electronics Corp. (Nasdaq/NM:
NUHC), a leading distributor of active and passive electronic components today
reported financial and operating results for the second quarter and six months
ended August 31, 2004.

Net sales for the quarter ended August 31, 2004 were $119.2 million compared to
$80.0 million for the comparable period last year, an increase of 49%. Net
income for the quarter was $1,186,000 or $0.07 per share on 16,884,147 basic
shares outstanding [$.07 per share on 17,663,839 diluted shares], compared to a
net loss of $(623,000) or $(0.04) per share on 16,681,145 basic and diluted
shares outstanding in the same period last year.

For the six months ended August 31, 2004, net sales increased to $237.4 million
from $152.8 million in the comparable period last year, an increase of 55%. Net
income for the first half of fiscal 2005 was $2,372,000 or $0.14 per share on
16,884,147 basic shares outstanding [$0.13 per share on 17,875,443 diluted
shares], compared with a net loss of $(1,454,000), or $(0.09) per share on
16,678,093 basic and diluted shares outstanding in the year-earlier period.

Arthur Nadata, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Nu Horizons,
said, "Sales and net income, year over year and quarter over quarter, showed
substantial gains as our industry continued its recovery from the downturn
experienced a few years ago. While we were able to report a slight increase in
sequential sales for the quarter ended August 31, 2004, $119.2 million as
compared to $118.2 million for the quarter ended May 31, 2004, in practical
terms sales remained relatively flat after five quarters of substantial
sequential sales increases."

Nadata continued, "This slowing in our sequential rate of growth appears to be
an industry-wide phenomenon, which also coincides with the historically slower
sales activity in the summer period. The question is whether it is a temporary
pause or a more permanent slowing of industry growth. We believe that the next
six to nine months will result in a more modest sequential industry growth rate
than was experienced over the past eighteen months."

Nadata concluded, "Our gross margins appear to have stabilized and have actually
improved modestly over the past two quarters. We believe that our overall sales
growth should continue to be positively impacted by our demand creation model
approach which should allow us to maintain margins as well as continue to
increase our market share although no assurances can be given in this regard."

A conference call to further discuss earnings will be held today at 4:15 pm ET.
