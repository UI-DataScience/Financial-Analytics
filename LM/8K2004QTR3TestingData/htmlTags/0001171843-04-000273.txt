		<H3 align=center>Quanex Announces Fiscal Third Quarter 2004 Results</H3>
		<H4 align=center>Record Net Sales and Operating Income</H4><PRE>

    Increased Cash Dividend 12% and Authorized Additional Stock Buyback
          Recent Acquisitions Continued to Exceed Expectations
                 Full Year Earnings Guidance $3.25 - $3.75
</PRE>
<P>HOUSTON, Aug. 26, 2004 (PRIMEZONE) -- Quanex Corporation (NYSE:NX) announced
fiscal third quarter results for the period ending July 31, 2004. Net sales were
a record $424.1 million in the quarter, up 71% over a year ago, and included net
sales of $106.5 from the Company's recent acquisitions of MACSTEEL Monroe and
TruSeal Technologies. Demand at the Vehicular Products and Building Products
segments was robust throughout the quarter, and backlogs remain healthy for the
remainder of the fiscal year. Operating income was a record $35.3 million, and
income from continuing operations was $21.0 million, up 40% compared to last
year's third quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were
$1.26, up 37% from a year ago. </P>
<P>Third quarter 2004 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of
$1.26 include the operating results from Monroe and TruSeal of approximately
$0.34 per share and a LIFO charge of $0.19 per share. Third quarter 2003 diluted
earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.92 include an executive life
insurance benefit of $0.13 per share and a LIFO charge of $0.02 per share.
Excluding the financial impact of the acquisitions, the LIFO charges and the
life insurance benefit, results are up 36% for the third quarter 2004 over the
third quarter 2003. </P>
<P>Net sales for the third quarter 2003 were $247.4 million. Income from
continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations
for the third quarter 2003 were $15.0 million and $0.92, respectively. </P>
<P>Highlights </P>
<P>Raymond A. Jean, chairman and chief executive officer stated, "We delivered
to our investors back-to-back record quarterly operating income resulting from:
(1) robust customer demand, (2) new customer programs, (3) improved margins, (4)
accretive acquisitions, and (5) ongoing company-wide lean initiatives. North
American light vehicle builds in our third quarter were in line with the
year-ago period. Heavy duty truck builds remain very strong compared to last
year, with builds up this quarter some 40% over this time last year. Housing
starts and remodeling activity remained at high levels through the quarter as
well," Jean said. </P>
<P>"We announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.17 to $0.19
per share, which equates to a $0.76 per share dividend on an annualized basis.
The Board also authorized the Company to reload its stock buyback program,
increasing the existing authorization up to one million shares. These actions
are consistent with our excellent financial results and our prospects for the
future. Quanex historically generates very strong cash flow, and for fiscal
2004, we anticipate operating cash flow to be in the $100 million to $115
million range at this time. Looking out the next few years, we believe we can
manage our business to generate robust cash that will enable us to continue to
fund the growth of our core businesses while rewarding our long-term
shareholders. Our last dividend increase occurred in the second quarter of
2003," said Jean. </P>
<P>"Excellent progress continued with the integration of MACSTEEL Monroe and
TruSeal Technologies. Both facilities continue to exceed our operating and
financial expectations. On an annualized basis, we believe the two acquisitions
will now generate diluted earnings per share this year of $0.75 to $0.85, after
interest expense, up an additional $0.15 per share from our previous estimate,"
continued Jean. </P>
<P>Quanex uses the LIFO method of accounting to enhance its cash flow, which
requires the Company to revalue inventories year to year. Raw material costs,
particularly steel scrap, are up substantially from the end of last year, which
negatively impacts ongoing inventory valuations based on the LIFO method. For
the third quarter, the Company booked a $5.0 million pre-tax, non-cash LIFO
charge. </P><PRE>

 Operating Income                    24.9              11.7
</PRE>
<P>The Vehicular Products segment is focused on providing customers with
value-added, engineered steel bar products and extrusions. Key market drivers
are primarily light vehicle and heavy duty truck production. </P>
<P>"Combined North American light vehicle builds and heavy duty truck builds
remained at high levels during the quarter. Customer demand at our engineered
steel products business remained strong, and our operations ran at very high
utilization rates. Automotive OEMs trimmed light vehicle inventory days about
13% in July from June, to 64 days. This appears to be holding OEM build
schedules to slightly below this time last year, and with our new programs, our
backlog will remain strong throughout the fourth quarter," continued Jean. </P>
<P>"Engineered steel bar shipments were up 92% in the quarter versus the
year-ago quarter, and up 17% when you set aside shipments from our recently
acquired Monroe facility. Operating income increased due to excellent demand and
improved margins, the result of a higher scrap surcharge. Average raw material
costs were about even with the second quarter," Jean said. </P><PRE>

  BUILDING PRODUCTS     ($ in millions)

                          3rd qtr 2004     3rd qtr 2003
   Net Sales                    $198.1           $149.1
   Operating Income               20.3             12.3
</PRE>
<P>The Building Products segment is focused on providing customers with
engineered products and components for window and door manufacturers, and is a
large producer of common alloy aluminum sheet. Key market drivers are
residential building and remodeling markets. </P>
<P>"Our engineered products business experienced very strong sales throughout
the quarter," Jean said. "Demand for our window and door components remained
high as housing starts and remodeling activity generally remained brisk.
Customer demand is expected to again be strong in our fourth quarter." </P>
<P>"Our aluminum sheet business had an excellent quarter as both sales and
operating income were up from last quarter and the year-ago quarter as well.
Shipments were strong to our building and construction customers. Further
benefiting the aluminum sheet business this year has been the gradual
improvement in demand from our capital equipment, service center, and
transportation customers. The business experienced higher prices that more than
offset increases in material costs, and improved credit terms with many of its
customers," said Jean. </P>
<P>Outlook </P>
<P>Customer demand in the Company's two target markets, vehicular products and
building products, is expected to remain strong through the remainder of the
fiscal year, supported by an improving economy and strong market drivers. </P>
<P>Vehicular Products - 2004 North American light vehicle builds are expected to
be essentially in line with last year's production. Heavy truck builds for 2004
could end the calendar year up 50% over 2003 builds of 175,000, while demand in
the capital equipment, farm/construction and seamless tubing industry is
expected to continue to improve. </P>
<P>The business model for our engineered steel products business is built
primarily on supplying customers with engineered alloy and carbon steel bar
products whose prices are based on annual contracts, with quarterly surcharge
adjustments for raw material costs. In a period of escalating raw material
costs, as has been experienced over the last 12 months, earnings are reduced by
the inherent three (3) month lag in the surcharge adjustment. For instance, in
the July/August time period, the business experienced raw material cost
increases of some $90 per ton over June. These higher costs will be recovered,
but not until the new surcharge adjustment takes effect on October 1. In a
period of declining scrap costs, earnings are enhanced. To appreciate the
business' normalized earnings power, financial results that reach beyond
quarterly timeframes will need to be considered. </P>
<P>Building Products - Market drivers should remain positive through the
remainder of the Company's fiscal year, resulting in excellent order activity.
Housing starts for 2004 are expected to be very close to last year's record 1.85
million units, while remodeling expenditures, which the Company believes account
for about one half of the segment's sales, are also expected to remain at
healthy levels. The engineered products business will continue to deliver
excellent operating results. At the aluminum sheet business, the Company expects
continued strong sales and rising income, driven by robust customer demand and a
much improved aluminum sheet supply/demand balance. </P>
<P>Quanex's earnings outlook for the fourth quarter remains favorable when
compared to year-ago results. But the volatility of steel scrap costs and its
influence on the valuation of LIFO inventories at year-end make the fourth
quarter earnings outlook difficult to predict. Notwithstanding the above, the
Company's original, annual 2004 diluted earnings per share guidance from
continuing operations of $3.25 to $3.75 remains appropriate. </P>
<P>Other </P>
<P>The Company continues to account for stock options using the current
transition provisions of SFAS No. 123. Accordingly, Quanex does not reflect the
option expense in its income statement or diluted earnings per share. However,
the Company does disclose the impact on net income and diluted earnings per
share in the footnotes to its SEC financial statements. Expensing stock options
in the third quarter would have reduced net income by about $525,000 after-tax,
or $.03 on a diluted earnings per share basis. </P>
<P>On March 31, 2004, Quanex announced its plans for restructuring Piper Impact
and called for the sale of the business. The Company stated that while Piper
Impact continued to generate positive cash flow, its market focus is no longer
aligned with Quanex's strategic direction of serving the vehicular products and
building products markets. As part of the restructuring effort, Piper's third
quarter operating results have been reclassified as discontinued operations.
Quanex has a letter of intent to sell the business, and is currently working
with the buyer on a definitive agreement. At this point in the process, Quanex
expects proceeds from the sale of Piper to be below the division's net book
value, and accordingly, recorded a $3.1 million after-tax write-off in
discontinued operations for the third quarter. </P>
<P>On July 1, 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) made a preliminary proposal that would require
all issuing companies of contingent convertible debentures to show the full,
dilutive impact of these debentures on their financial statements. Based on the
EITF proposal currently under review, this could mean an additional 2.2 million
shares of earnings dilution to Quanex and have an annualized earnings per share
impact of approximately $0.30 - $0.35 per common share. However, the Company
does have the option to settle its convertible obligation with either common
stock, cash or a combination of the two. If the Company chooses to settle its
entire convertible obligation with cash, it would not be required to show the
dilutive impact of the higher share count in the calculation of its earnings per
share. </P>
<P>Cash Dividend Raised &amp; Declared </P>
<P>The Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend approximately 12%,
or $0.02 per share, which equates to an annualized increase of $0.08 per share.
The quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 is payable to shareholders of record on
September 15, 2004, and is payable September 30, 2004. </P>
<P>Corporate Profile </P>
