            Conn's, Inc. Reports Record Second Quarter 2005 Earnings

     BEAUMONT, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 30, 2004--Conn's, Inc.
(Nasdaq/NM:CONN), a specialty retailer of home appliances, consumer electronics,
home office products, bedding and lawn and garden products, today announced
record results for the quarter and six months ended July 31, 2004.
     Net income available for common stockholders for the second quarter
increased 37.6% to $6.8 million compared to $4.9 million for the second quarter
of last year. Diluted earnings per share available for common stockholders
decreased 3.3% to $0.29 from $0.30 in the prior year. On a pro forma basis, as
though all shares issued in the initial public offering were outstanding in both
periods for the full period and IPO proceeds were used to pay-off existing
balance sheet debt, diluted earnings per share increased 16.0% to $0.29 for the
quarter ended July 31, 2004 from $0.25 for the quarter ended July 31, 2003. Net
revenues for the quarter ended July 31, 2004 increased 16.6% to $136.6 million
compared with $117.1 million for the quarter ended July 31, 2003. This increase
in revenue included net sales increases of $16.1 million, or 15.7%, and
increases from "Finance charges and other" of $3.4 million, or 23.5%. Same store
sales (revenues earned in stores operated for the entirety of both periods)
increased 7.2% for the second quarter of fiscal 2005. One of the factors that
contributed to success in sales increases and profitability in the current
quarter was the expansion of credit promotion programs in excess of one year;
the corresponding offset to these operational improvements included a higher use
of cash to absorb receivable growth that does not qualify for funding under the
asset-backed securitization program.
     Net revenues for the six months ended July 31, 2004 increased 14.1% to
$271.5 million compared with $237.9 million for the six months ended July 31,
2003. This increase in revenue included net sales increases of $28.0 million, or
13.4%, and increases from "Finance charges and other" of $5.6 million, or 19.7%.
Same store sales increased 5.3% for the first six months of fiscal 2004. Net
income available for common stockholders for the six months ended July 31, 2004
increased 54.4% to $14.6 million compared to $9.4 million for the first six
months of last year. Diluted earnings per share available for the common
stockholder increased 8.9% to $0.61 from $0.56 in the prior year. On a pro forma
basis, as though all shares issued in the initial public offering were
outstanding in both periods for the full period and IPO proceeds were used to
pay-off existing balance sheet debt, diluted earnings per share increased 24.5%
to $0.61 for the six months ended July 31, 2004 from $0.49 for the six months
ended July 31, 2003.
     "We continue to be pleased with our progress since becoming a public
company," said Thomas J. Frank, Conn's chairman and chief executive officer. "We
feel that the same store sales performance for the quarter and the year
indicates that we kept our commitment to potential investors to execute at an
exceptional level. We believe the additional capital expenditures that we have
recently made remodeling our stores has already had a positive impact on our
operations and will continue to generate an appropriate return on our
investment. The continuation of our efforts to push our primary business in
appliances and electronics and the emphasis that we have placed on track sales,
bedding and lawn and garden categories seems to be providing positive results,
both at the top and bottom lines."

     EPS Guidance

     The Company also issued guidance for the third quarter ended Oct. 31, 2004
of earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.25 to $0.27. Guidance issued
for the entire year continues to include earnings per diluted share of
approximately $1.24 to $1.26, with comparable store sales increase in the mid
single digit range.

     About Conn's, Inc.

     The Company is a specialty retailer currently operating 47 retail locations
in Texas and Louisiana. It sells major home appliances, including refrigerators,
freezers, washers, dryers and ranges, and a variety of consumer electronics,
including projection, plasma and LCD televisions, camcorders, VCRs, DVD players
and home theater products. The Company also sells home office equipment, lawn
and garden products and bedding, and continues to introduce additional product
categories for the home to help increase same store sales and to respond to our
customers' product needs.
     Unlike many of its competitors, the Company provides in-house credit
options for its customers. Historically, it has financed over 56% of retail
sales. Customer receivables are financed substantially through an asset-backed
securitization facility, from which the Company derives servicing fee income and
interest income from these assets. The Company transfers receivables, consisting
of retail installment contracts and revolving accounts extended to its
customers, to a qualifying special purpose entity, or the issuer, in exchange
for cash and subordinated securities represented by asset-backed and variable
funding notes issued to third parties.

"intend," "could," "estimate," "should," "anticipate," or "believe," or the
negative thereof or variations thereon or similar terminology. Although the

Company's estimated capital expenditures and costs related to the opening of new
stores or the update or expansion of existing stores; the Company's cash flow
from operations, borrowings from its revolving line of credit and proceeds from
securitizations to fund operations, debt repayment and expansion; growth trends
and projected sales in the home appliance and consumer electronics industry and
the Company's ability to capitalize on such growth; relationships with the
Company's key suppliers; the results of the Company's litigation; interest
rates; weather conditions in the Company's markets; changes in the Company's
stock price; and the actual number of shares of common stock outstanding.
Further information on these risk factors is included in the Company's filings

filed on April 16, 2004. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these

The use of pro forma information is considered necessary to provide
the reader with more comparable earnings per share information year
over year. As a result of the IPO transaction, the additional shares
issued were significant relative to the shares outstanding in the
prior year, the retirement of debt substantially reduced interest
expense, and preferred dividends are no longer accrued or paid.
Consequently, the shares outstanding have been adjusted to reflect the
IPO transaction as though it took place on Feb. 1, 2003, interest
expense associated with the debt that would have been paid-off has
been reduced, and preferred dividends have been eliminated in all
periods in order to compute earnings per share on a more comparable
basis.
