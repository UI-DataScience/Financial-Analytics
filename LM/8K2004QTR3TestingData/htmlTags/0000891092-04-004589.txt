       Resources Connection, Inc. Reports Record First Quarter Results

     Revenue Grows 94% and Earnings Per Share Triple Quarter Over Quarter

    COSTA MESA, Calif., Sept. 29 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Resources
Connection, Inc. (Nasdaq: RECN), an international professional services firm
that provides accounting and finance, human capital, information management,
supply chain management and internal audit/risk management services on a
project basis, today announced financial results for the quarter ended
August 31, 2004.
    Total revenue improved 94% to $115.4 million for the first quarter of
fiscal 2005, from $59.5 million for the comparable quarter in fiscal 2004, and
8% from the previous quarter.  Net income for the quarter ended August 31,
2004, was $11.6 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared to net income of
$3.4 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the August 2003 quarter.
    "We are off to an excellent start both financially and operationally in
fiscal 2005, marked by continued improvements in profitability and strong
revenue growth," said Chairman and CEO, Donald Murray.  "In particular, the
strength of our internal audit and finance and accounting practices continues
to grow as we assist clients working to implement long-term, cost-effective
compliance solutions in response to the ongoing demands of Sarbanes-Oxley.
Importantly, our compliance work has served as an entree into providing
additional specialized project services across each of our service lines.
This ability to remain flexible in response to the changing market needs and
those of our growing client base has been an important contributor to our
success, and we look forward to continuing this momentum throughout the rest
of the year."
    "Our operating income as a percentage of revenue was greater than we
planned as demand grew faster than our internal hiring," Mr. Murray continued.
"We expect to fill several open positions that may reduce our operating income
percentage to our planned level."
