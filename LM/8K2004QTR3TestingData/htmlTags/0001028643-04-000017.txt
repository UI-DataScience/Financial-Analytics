            DOLLAR FINANCIAL GROUP ANNOUNCES FISCAL 2004 YEAR END AND
                  FISCAL 2004 FOURTH QUARTER OPERATING RESULTS

     BERWYN,  Pennsylvania,  August 27,  2004 - Dollar  Financial  Group,  Inc.,
("Dollar" or the "Company"),  a leading international financial services company
serving under-banked customers, today announced record revenue of $246.4 million
and net income of $4.9  million  for the fiscal  year ended June 30,  2004.  The
Company realized revenue of $63.1 million and net income of $3.8 million for the
fourth  quarter of the 2004 fiscal year compared to revenue of $55.5 million and
net income of $577,000 for the same period in the prior year.

     Commenting on the results,  Jeff Weiss,  the  Company's  Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer said, "We are very pleased with our financial results as these
results evidence our ability to continue to focus on the core business  strategy
of providing the right  product mix to our  customers as well as a  high-quality
service.  We also  continue to see  moderate  improvement  in the U.S.  economy,
particularly  in lower-wage  service  sector jobs,  which  directly  impacts our
customer base. In addition,  due to our continued focus on collection  practices
and  underwriting  standards,  all of our key  credit  ratios  are in line  with
expectations.  Our new product  efforts are bearing  fruit,  most notably in the
areas of debit card and installment loans. Specifically, during the June quarter
we  signed an  agreement  with  Visa  U.S.A.,  Inc.  and West  Suburban  Bank to
exclusively  market Visa(R) branded prepaid card products in the U.S. and we are
in the process of  rolling-out  this  program to all of our 319 U.S.  locations.
Fiscal 2004 was an outstanding year for our Company made possible, as always, by
the hard work and  dedication  of our more than 3,300  employees  worldwide.  My
thanks go to all of them for a job very well done."

     Don  Gayhardt,  the  Company's  President  commented,  "In  addition to the
improving U.S.  operations,  we continue to realize strong  performance from our
international (Canada and the United Kingdom) operations as indicated by a 25.4%
increase  in total  foreign  revenue to $136.6  million for the 2004 fiscal year
from $108.9 million for the prior year period. We increased our company-operated
and franchised  locations by 28 units in Canada and the United Kingdom,  as well
as executed our first U.S.  market  franchise  development  agreement  for three
franchise stores. We also continue to benefit from higher international earnings
as the dollar remains weak in relation to the Canadian and U.K. currencies."

Fiscal Year Results

     Total  revenues,  which were led  primarily  by strong  check  cashing  and
consumer loan revenues, increased 12.3 % for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004
to $246.4  million  from $219.4  million  for the same  period last year.  Total
revenues for comparable retail stores (defined as company owned stores that were
open for at least 24 continuous months prior to June 30, 2004), franchised store
and document  transmitter  revenues  increased 11.5%, or $24.8 million,  for the
2004 fiscal year.

     Total  store and  regional  expenses  decreased  as a  percentage  of total
revenues to 63.2% for the 2004 fiscal year from 64.9% for the prior year period.
The decrease was primarily due to increased revenues, specifically the Company's
consumer loan product offering,  as well as a decrease in salaries and benefits,
occupancy,  returned  check,  net and  cash  shortages,  telecommunications  and
armored carrier services as a percentage of total revenues.  Corporate  expenses
for the 2004 fiscal year were $32.8 million or 13.3% of total revenues  compared
to $31.2  million  or 14.2% of total  revenues  for the prior year  period.  The
decrease as a percentage of total  revenues was  primarily  related to increased
revenues,  as well as a decrease  in  salaries  and  benefits,  advertising  and
professional fees as a percentage of total revenues.

     Adjusted  EBITDA for the fiscal  year ended June 30, 2004  increased  $13.1
million,  or 25.6%,  to $64.6  million  from $51.4  million for the prior fiscal
year.  Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues  increased to 26.2% for
the  fiscal  year  ended June 30,  2004 from  23.4% for the prior  fiscal  year.
Adjusted EBITDA is not an item prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA
is  earnings  before  interest  expense,  income  tax  provision,  depreciation,
amortization  and other items as  described in the  attached  table.  Net income
increased $2.8 million or 130.5%,  to $4.9 million for the fiscal year from $2.1
million for the prior fiscal year.



Fiscal Fourth Quarter Results

     Total revenues increased 13.7% for the fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30,
2004 to $63.1  million from $55.5  million for the same period last year.  Total
revenues for comparable retail stores (defined as company owned stores that were
opened for at least 15  continuous  months prior to June 30,  2004),  franchised
store and document  transmitter  revenues increased 12.8%, or $7.1 million,  for
the 2004 fiscal fourth quarter.

     Total  store and  regional  expenses  decreased  as a  percentage  of total
revenues to 62.4% for the 2004 fiscal  fourth  quarter  from 63.8% for the prior
year period. The decrease was primarily due to increased revenues, in particular
the Company's consumer loan product offering,  as well as a decrease in salaries
and   benefits,   occupancy,   returned   check,   net   and   cash   shortages,
telecommunications  and  armored  carrier  services  as a  percentage  of  total
revenues.  Corporate  expenses  for the 2004 fiscal  fourth  quarter  were $10.1
million or 16.0% of total  revenues  compared to $7.5  million or 13.6% of total
revenues for the prior year period.  The increase was primarily related to costs
associated with the revaluation of U.S. dollar denominated debt held by our U.K.
subsidiary  and the  modification  of our foreign  currency  hedging  program at
year-end.

the fiscal  fourth  quarter  ended  June 30,  2004 from 24.5% for the prior year

EBITDA Reconciliation

     Adjusted EBITDA is not an item prepared in accordance  with GAAP.  Adjusted
EBITDA is earnings before interest expense, income tax provision,  depreciation,
amortization and other items described below. Dollar presents Adjusted EBITDA as
an indication of operating  performance  and its ability to service its debt and
capital  expenditure  requirements.  Adjusted  EBITDA does not indicate  whether
Dollar's cash flow will be  sufficient  to fund all of its cash needs.  Adjusted
EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute  for net income,
cash flows from operating activities or other measures of operating  performance
or liquidity  determined in  accordance  with GAAP.  Dollar  believes that these
amounts should be reviewed by prospective  investors because Dollar uses them as
one means of analyzing  its ability to service its debt and capital  expenditure
requirements, and Dollar understands that they are used by some investors as one
measure  of a  Company's  historical  ability to  service  its debt and  capital
expenditure  requirements.  Not  all  companies  calculate  EBITDA  in the  same
fashion, and therefore these amounts as presented may not be comparable to other
similarly  titled  measures of other  companies.  The tables below reconcile net
income as reported on  Dollar's  Statements  of  Operations  to Adjusted  EBITDA
(dollars in thousands):
