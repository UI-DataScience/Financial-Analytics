<p align=center><b>KinderCare Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2004 Results</b></p>

<p><b>(Portland, Ore.) &#150; August 23, 2004</b> &#150;
KinderCare Learning Centers, Inc. announces net
revenues of $210.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, an increase of
$7.4 million, or 3.7%, from the same period last year. The increase was due to
higher tuition rates, offset by reduced occupancy, as well as additional net
revenues generated by the newly opened centers. Comparable center net revenues
increased $4.6 million, or 2.3%. </p>

<p>The average weekly tuition
rate grew $8.18 or 5.6%, from the same period last year to $154.51, due
primarily to tuition increases. Occupancy declined 1.8 percentage points to
64.1% due primarily to reduced full-time equivalent attendance within the
population of older centers. </p>

<p>During the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2004, operating income was $21.6 million, a decrease of $1.5 million,
or 6.4%, from the same period last year. The decrease in operating income was
due primarily to overall higher expense for salaries, wages and benefits and
increased asset impairment charges included in depreciation expense, offset by
cost controls. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues in the fourth
quarters of fiscal 2004 and 2003 was 10.3% and 11.4%, respectively. </p>

<p>Net income was $8.3 million
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to $3.4 million in the same
period last year, an increase of 147.3%. The most significant reason for the
increase was the absence in fiscal 2004 of a $4.0 million, after taxes,
write-down of a minority investment ($6.7 million before taxes), which was
recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. For the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004 basic and diluted net income per share were both $0.42. Basic and diluted
net income per share were both $0.17 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. </p>

<p>EBITDAR increased $10.0
million, or 23.5%, to $52.7 million, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004,
from the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to higher tuition
rates and the absence of a write-down of a minority investment. As a percentage
of net revenues, EBITDAR was 25.1% and 21.1% for the fourth quarters of fiscal
2004 and 2003, respectively. <p>

<p>Our cash balance was $58.9
million at May 28, 2004, an increase of $24.3 million from the third quarter of
fiscal 2004. The increase was due to increased cash flow from sale-leaseback
proceeds and operating activities. Our total debt was $488.8 million at May 28,
2004, a decrease of $28.3 million from the third quarter of fiscal 2004. The
decrease was primarily the result of redemption of $15.0 million of aggregate
principal amount of our 9.5% senior subordinated notes and an $11.0 million
reduction in borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Capital
expenditures were $16.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, an
increase of $2.7 million from the same period last year. </p>

<p>During both of the fourth
quarters of fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, four centers were opened. We closed
nine centers during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to four centers
in the same period last year. </p>

<p><b>Fiscal Year 2004</b></p>

<p>Net revenues for fiscal
2004, were $855.9 million, an increase of $21.3 million, or 2.5%, over the same
period last year. The increase was due to higher tuition rates, offset by
reduced occupancy, as well as additional net revenues generated by the newly
opened centers. Comparable center net revenues increased $4.2 million, or 0.5%. </p>

<p>The average weekly tuition
rate grew $8.19, or 5.7%, from the same period last year to $152.64 due
primarily to tuition increases. Occupancy declined 2.9 percentage points to
60.4% due primarily to reduced full-time equivalent attendance within the
population of older centers. </p>

<p>During fiscal 2004,
operating income was $72.0 million, a decrease of $0.9 million or 1.2%. The
decrease was due primarily to increased rent expense largely as a result of the
sale-leaseback program, offset by cost controls. As a percentage of net
revenues, operating income was 8.4% and 8.7% in fiscal 2004 and 2003,
respectively. </p>

<p>Net income was $14.7
million in fiscal 2004, an increase of $1.3 million, or 9.6%, from the same
period last year. Net income as a percentage of net revenues was 1.7% and 1.6%
in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. The slight improvement in margin was due
primarily to control over costs. Basic and diluted net income per share were
$0.75 and $0.74, respectively, in fiscal 2004. For fiscal 2003, basic and
diluted net income per share were $0.68 and $0.67, respectively. </p>

<p>EBITDAR was $189.9 million
in the fiscal 2004, an increase of $13.1 million over the same period last year.
As a percentage of net revenues, EBITDAR was 22.2% in fiscal 2004 compared to
21.2% in fiscal 2003. The increase was due primarily to higher tuition rates,
control over costs and the absence in fiscal year 2004 of a charge for the
write-down of a minority investment, which was recorded in fiscal 2003. EBITDAR
represents earnings before interest expense, investment income, income taxes,
depreciation, amortization, rent and related components of discontinued
operations. </p>

<p>Our total debt was $488.8 million at May 28, 2004, an increase of $33.7
million from May 30, 2003, while our cash balance increased $40.8 million to
$58.9 million over the same period due primarily to net proceeds received from
our sale-leaseback program and cash provided by operating activities. The
increase in our debt was largely the result of our debt refinancing in July
2003, which included financing the acquisition of the centers included in our
former $97.9 million synthetic lease facility, offset by the repurchase and
redemption of $110.6 million aggregate principal amount of our 9.5% senior
subordinated notes. Capital expenditures were $58.4 million in fiscal 2004, a
decrease of $24.7 million from the same period last year, which was primarily
due to a reduction in spending for new center development.
</p>

<p>During fiscal 2004, 16 new
centers were opened compared to 28 in the same period last year. In addition, we
completed the acquisition of one center in fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2004, 41
centers were closed compared to 28 in the same period last year. </p>

<p><b>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</b><p>

<p>A non-GAAP financial
measure is a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance,
financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts, or is
subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding or including amounts,
from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;). At the end of
this release, we have provided a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDAR, non-GAAP
measures of our liquidity, to cash provided by operating activities, the most
comparable GAAP financial measure. </p>

<p>We believe EBITDA and
EBITDAR are useful tools for certain investors and creditors for measuring our
ability to meet debt service requirements. Additionally, management uses EBITDA
and EBITDAR for purposes of reviewing our results of operations on a more
comparable basis. EBITDA and EBITDAR do not represent cash flow from operations
as defined by GAAP, are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all
cash flow needs and should not be considered alternatives to net income under
GAAP for purposes of evaluating our results of operations. </p>

<p><b>Comparable Centers</b></p>

<p>A center is included in
comparable center net revenues when it has been open and operated by us at least
one year and it has not been rebuilt or permanently relocated within that year.
Therefore, a center is considered comparable during the first four-week period
it has prior year net revenues. Non-comparable centers include those that have
been closed. </p>

<p><b>Discontinued Operations</b></p>

<p>Discontinued operations
represents the operating results for all periods presented of the 69 centers
closed since fiscal 2002. </p>

<p><b>Fiscal Calendar</b></p>

<p>Our fiscal year ends on the
Friday closest to May 31. The first fiscal quarter is comprised of 16 weeks,
while the second, third and fourth quarters are each comprised of 12 weeks. </p>

<p><b>Conference Call</b></p>

<p>We will host a conference
call on Tuesday, August 24, 2004 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, at 1.888.417.7531
(reference: KinderCare) to discuss our fiscal 2004 results. Replays will be
available through Monday, August 30, 2004 at 1.800.642.1687, access
identification number 9264015. This call will also be streamed over the
internet, accessible via http://www.kindercare.com/about_ir, at the webcast
listing. Replays will be available at our website for 90 days from the date of
the call. </p>
