                 Proginet Announces Year End Results for FY 2004
                         and Annual Shareholder Meeting


Garden City, N.Y.--September 28, 2004--Proginet [OTCBB: PRGF], developer of
software to enable the controlled integration of data across enterprises of all
sizes, announced today the financial results for the year ended July 31, 2004.

Total revenues for the year increased by 17%, amounting to $6,301,818 compared
to total revenues of $5,386,921 in fiscal 2003. Software license revenues
increased by 51.7%, amounting to $2,319,702 compared to $1,528,840 for the same
period in fiscal 2003. Software maintenance fees and other increased to
$3,982,116 compared to software maintenance fees and other of $3,858,081 in the
prior fiscal year. Total operating expenses, net amounted to $6,784,445 compared
to $5,937,297 in fiscal 2003. The Company reported a net loss of $482,627 for
the fiscal year ending July 31, 2004, compared to a net loss of $550,376 for
fiscal 2003.

The fiscal 2004 increase in expenditures is attributed primarily to an increase
in sales and marketing activities including expanded staffing levels, and the
retention of a public relations firm and industry analysts. For fiscal 2005, the
Company projects sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase,
reflecting Proginet's revenue growth plans and continued focus on sales.

Proginet had many successes in fiscal 2004. Revenues increased significantly,
newly released products gained a solid footing in the marketplace, and Proginet
established a strategic partnership with Microsoft for the introduction of a
solution that extends the password management functionality of Microsoft servers
to non-Windows platforms.

"While profitability is projected in the new fiscal year, strong revenue growth
and solid strategic positioning in our chosen market are our primary goals,"
said Kevin M. Kelly, president and CEO of Proginet. "We have optimized our
organizational investments over the past few years and now it is time to
capitalize on these investments."
