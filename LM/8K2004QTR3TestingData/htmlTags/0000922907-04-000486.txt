Item 2.02.  Report of Operations and Financial Condition.</b>

     As more fully discussed below in Item 4.02, on September 29, 2004, Energy
West, Incorporated (the "Company"), issued a press release announcing that the
previously issued financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2002
and June 30, 2003, and the first three quarters of the fiscal year ended June
30, 2004 should not be relied upon because of the misclassification of a handful
of long-term contracts for purchase or sale of natural gas by its subsidiary,
Energy West Resources, Inc. and that those financial statements likely would be
restated to make the necessary accounting adjustments. The full text of the
press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by
reference.

<b>
Item 4.02  Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related
           Audit Report or Completed Interim Review</b>

     On September 29, 2004, the Company issued a press release announcing that
the previously issued financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 30,
2002 and June 30, 2003 and the first three quarters of the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2004 should not be relied upon because of errors in those financial
statements and that the Company likely would restate those financial statements
to make the necessary accounting adjustments.

     As reported in the Company's press release issued on September 29, 2004,
the Company is reviewing the accounting treatment of a handful of gas purchase
and sale contracts previously entered into by its subsidiary, Energy West
Resources, Inc. Although the Company's review has not been completed, it
anticipates that earnings for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 will be adjusted,
corresponding to adjustments in amounts reflected in its balance sheets as of
June 30, 2002 and 2003 for derivative assets and derivative liabilities. The
expected restatements will reflect the effect of the Company's determination
that several contracts entered into during fiscal year 2002 for the purchase or
sale of natural gas at fixed future prices were erroneously classified as normal
purchase and sale contracts. The Company now believes that these contracts did
not qualify as normal purchase and sale contracts under applicable accounting
rules, and therefore must be reflected in the Company's financial statements at
fair value, determined as of the end of each period. The valuation of such
contracts required to be reflected at fair value is referred to as
"mark-to-market" valuation.

     The addition of the contracts previously classified in error as normal
purchase and sale contracts to the group of contracts required to be reflected
at fair value is expected to result in adjustments to the mark-to-market gain
(loss) in the Company's contract portfolio, for fiscal years 2002 and 2003, and
the first three quarters of fiscal year 2004. The restatements are expected to
reduce net income for fiscal year 2002 in a range from $300,000 to $500,000. For
fiscal year 2003, the restatement is expected to change net loss in a range from
a reduction in net loss of $50,000 to an increase in net loss of $200,000. In
addition, the restatements are expected to reduce net income in ranges from
$100,000 to $200,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, from $200,000 to
$300,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2003, and from $50,000 to $100,000
for the quarter ended March 31, 2004.

</pre>
<hr>
<pre>

     None of the adjustments the Company anticipates making will affect the
Company's cash flows or cash positions during those years, or the first three
quarters of fiscal year 2004. The Company's cumulative gain (loss) in the
portfolio of contracts valued on a mark-to-market basis will be reversed in
later periods as contracts settle or are performed and/or as natural gas prices
change. The expected effects of such reversal in later periods will be to
increase the Company's income in future periods through fiscal year 2009, so
that the cumulative decrease in net income expected to result from the
restatements of prior periods will be offset in those future periods.

     The gas purchase and sale contracts that are expected to be reclassified
were entered into at the time of or shortly after the Company's termination of
derivative contracts with Enron Canada Corporation ("ECC") during the third
quarter of fiscal year 2002. The Company believes that its classification of
some of the gas purchase and sale contracts erroneously resulted in overstating
the income realized from application of mark-to-market accounting principles to
the contract portfolio. Accordingly, the Company expects that the results of the
restatements may reflect that the net effect of the termination of the ECC
derivatives will include a material downward adjustment of net income in fiscal
year 2002. The Company is continuing to review the effects of these transactions
on its financial statements.

     The estimated effects of the restatements are preliminary and subject to
audit. The final amount of the adjustments will be based upon the completion of
the review by the Company and its independent auditors.

     The Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors concluded on
September 29, 2004, based on the information available at that time, that the
previously issued financial statements for fiscal years 2002 and 2003, and the
first three quarters of fiscal year 2004, should not be relied upon because of
errors in those financial statements and that the Company likely would restate
those financial statements to make the necessary accounting adjustments.

     The Company's Audit Committee has discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP, the
Company's independent auditors, the matters disclosed in this Current Report on
Form 8-K.

     The full text of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and
incorporated herein by reference.  In addition, this Current Report on Form 8-K
and the press release contain statements intended as "forward-looking statements"
which are subject to the cautionary statements about forward-looking statements
set forth in the Company's press release.

         Energy West, Incorporated Announces Delay in Filing Form 10-K,
  Anticipated Restatement of Financial Results for Fiscal Years 2002 and 2003,
                  And First Three Quarters of Fiscal Year 2004</b>

         Great Falls, Mont., September 29, 2004 / PRNewswire - First
Call/--ENERGY WEST, INCORPORATED (NASDAQ: EWST - News), a natural gas, propane
and energy marketing company serving the Rocky Mountain states, announced today
that it will delay filing its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2004 in order to allow for the completion of a review of the
accounting treatment of a handful of long-term contracts for purchase or sale of
natural gas by its subsidiary, Energy West Resources, Inc. The review was
initiated in connection with the finalization of the audit of the Company's
financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004. The Company also
stated that it anticipates that it is likely that the review will result in a
restatement of certain components of the Company's financial statements for the
fiscal years ended June 30, 2002 and June 30, 2003, and the first three quarters
of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.

         None of the adjustments the Company anticipates making will affect the
Company's cash flows or cash positions during those years, or the first three
quarters of fiscal year 2004. In addition, the Company anticipates that the
expected cumulative downward adjustments in net income for previous periods will
be offset by increases in net income in future periods through fiscal year 2009
as the value of the Company's portfolio of contracts adjusts through settlement
or performance and changes in natural gas prices.

         The Company stated that, although its review has not been completed, it
anticipates that earnings for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 will be adjusted,
corresponding to adjustments in amounts reflected in its balance sheets as of
June 30, 2002 and June 30, 2003 for derivative assets and derivative
liabilities. The expected restatements will reflect the effect of the Company's
determination that several contracts entered into during fiscal year 2002 for
the purchase or sale of natural gas at fixed future prices were erroneously
classified as normal purchase and sale contracts. The Company now believes that
these contracts did not qualify as normal purchase and sale contracts under
applicable accounting rules, and therefore must be reflected in the Company's
financial statements at fair value, determined as of the end of each period. The
valuation of such contracts required to be reflected at fair value is referred
to as "mark-to-market" valuation.

         The addition of the contracts previously classified in error as normal
purchase and sale contracts to the group of contracts required to be reflected
at fair value is expected to result in adjustments to the mark-to-market gain
(loss) in the Company's contract portfolio, for fiscal years 2002 and 2003, and
the first three quarters of fiscal year 2004. The restatements are expected to
reduce net income for fiscal year 2002 in a range from $300,000 to $500,000. For
fiscal year 2003, the restatement is expected to change net loss in a range from
a reduction in net loss of $50,000 to an increase in net loss of $200,000. In
addition, the restatements are expected to reduce net income in ranges from
$100,000 to $200,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, from $200,000 to
$300,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2003, and from $50,000 to $100,000
for the quarter ended March 31, 2004.

</pre>

         The Company's cumulative gain (loss) in the portfolio of contracts
valued on a mark-to-market basis will be reversed in later periods as contracts
settle or are performed and/or as natural gas prices change. The expected
effects of such reversal in later periods will be to increase the Company's
income in future periods through fiscal year 2009, so that the cumulative
decrease in net income expected to result from the restatements of prior periods
will be offset in those future periods.

         The gas purchase and sale contracts that are expected to be
reclassified were entered into at the time of or shortly after the Company's
termination of derivative contracts with Enron Canada Corporation ("ECC") during
the third quarter of fiscal year 2002. The Company believes that its
classification of some of the gas purchase and sale contracts erroneously
resulted in overstating the income realized from application of mark-to-market
accounting principles to the contract portfolio. Accordingly, the Company
expects that the results of the restatements may reflect that the net effect of
the termination of the ECC derivatives will include a material downward
adjustment of net income in fiscal year 2002. The Company is continuing to
review the effects of these transactions on its financial statements.

         The estimated effects of the restatements are preliminary and subject
to audit. The final amount of the adjustments will be based upon the completion
of the review by the Company and its independent auditors.

         The Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors concluded
today, based on the information available at this time, that the previously
issued financial statements for fiscal years 2002 and 2003, and the first three
quarters of fiscal year 2004, should not be relied upon because of errors in
those financial statements and that the Company likely would restate those
financial statements to make the necessary accounting adjustments.

         David Cerotzke, the Company's President and CEO, stated "although we
are disappointed that our original treatment of these contracts was not fully in
accordance with the accounting rules, we believe our actions now will completely
resolve the earlier errors in classification of these contracts. This is a
significant step in putting behind us the problems associated with our marketing
activities, and allowing us to focus on our core utility operations. I would
like to emphasize that, in evaluating the cumulative impact of these changes, it
is very important to keep in mind that these adjustments have no effect on past
or future cash flow, and that the downward effect of the adjustments on our net
income in previous periods will be reversed by corresponding increases in net
income in future periods."

         The Company made a filing today with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to extend the date for filing its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2004 by up to 15 calendar days from September 28, 2004, the original
deadline. The Company expects to file its Form 10-K with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on or before October 13, 2004.
