   BARNEYS NEW YORK, INC. REPORTS RECORD SECOND QUARTER AND SIX MONTH RESULTS;
    COMP STORE SALES GROW 18%, EBITDA SURGES 99% AND NET INCOME IMPROVES OVER
                         $7.5 MILLION IN THE SIX MONTHS



New York, N.Y., August 24, 2004 - Barneys New York, Inc. today announced results
for the second quarter and six months ended July 31, 2004.

Net sales for the second quarter increased 14.9% to $102.0 million from $88.7
million in the corresponding period last year. Comparable store sales increased
13.8%. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)
increased 94.3% to $9.3 million in the second quarter of 2004, compared to $4.8
million in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. Reversing a loss in the year ago
period, net income rose to $0.9 million, or 6 cents per diluted share, for the
second quarter, compared with a loss of $2.1 million and 15 cents per share in
the year ago period.

Net sales for the six months ended July 31, 2004 increased 19.3% to $214.8
million from $180.1 million in the corresponding period last year. Comparable
store sales increased 18.0%. EBITDA increased 99.5% to $19.8 million in the six
months, compared to $9.9 million in the prior year period. Reversing a loss in
the year ago period, net income rose to $4.4 million, or 30 cents per diluted
share, for the six months, compared with a loss of $3.3 million and 23 cents per
share in the year ago period.

"It's been an excellent six month performance," stated Howard Socol, Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer. "Earnings improved over $7.5 million in
the season. Our performance resulted from two solid quarters of double-digit
comp store sales growth, improved full-price selling, and our continued focus on
expense control." Mr. Socol continued, "Top merchandise categories were Men's
and Women's Co-Op, along with Women's shoes, handbags, jewelry and Men's
tailored clothing. The momentum in our Co-Op business is particularly exciting
with the planned roll-out of our newest Co-Op stores on the Upper West Side of
Manhattan and in Chicago, Costa Mesa, California and Atlanta, Georgia."

<PAGE>
Mr. Socol added, "We are well positioned entering the fall season. Our inventory
has never been fresher. Renovations in our Beverly Hills store are nearing
completion and we are very excited about the recent unveiling of our new 2nd
floor in our Madison Avenue store intensifying our Women's designer business. We
have stepped up our marketing campaigns to support the sales growth initiatives
of the Company and are very focused on holiday 2004. Fall will be an exciting
time for the Company and we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the
momentum in the luxury sector."

</TABLE>

EBITDA for each period represents the sum of (a) the respective amounts of Net
income (loss) set forth above for such period; plus (b) the respective amounts
of Interest and Financing Costs, Net of Interest Income, Income Taxes and
Depreciation and Amortization. EBITDA is not an alternative measure of operating
results or cash flows from operations, as determined in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We have included
EBITDA because we believe it is an indicative measure of our operating
performance and our ability to meet our debt service requirements and is used by
investors and analysts to evaluate companies in our industry. EBITDA is also a
measure utilized in a covenant contained in our credit facility and in a
covenant in the indenture governing our 9% senior secured notes that limits our
ability to incur indebtedness. As presented by us, EBITDA may not be comparable
to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, operating
income, net income (loss), cash flow and other measures of financial performance
and liquidity reported in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. In addition, a substantial portion of our EBITDA
must be dedicated to the payment of interest on our indebtedness and to service
other commitments, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other
purposes. Accordingly, EBITDA does not represent an amount of funds that is
available for management's discretionary use.
