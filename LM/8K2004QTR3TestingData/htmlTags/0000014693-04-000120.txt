FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

BROWN-FORMAN CORPORATION REPORTS RECORD FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS

Louisville,  KY, August 26, 2004 -  Brown-Forman  Corporation  reported  diluted
earnings per share for its first  quarter  ended July 31, 2004 of $0.42,  up 66%
from the $0.26 earned in the same period last year.  Earnings  growth was driven
primarily by continued volume and margin  improvement from the company's premium
spirits portfolio and profits from the company's  introductory  shipments of its
new  low-carbohydrate  wine  brands,  One.6  Chardonnay  and  One.9  Merlot.  In
addition,  this quarter  benefited from the absence of an approximate  $0.06 per
share charge related to last year's legal  settlement with a former  distributor
in the United Kingdom.  Partially  offsetting this first quarter earnings growth
was continued softness within the Consumer Durables segment,  higher pension and
postretirement  expenses,  volume declines for Fetzer Premium  Varietals,  and a
decline in profits from Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails.

Adjusting for the $10 million of legal settlement expenses incurred in the first
quarter of the prior year,  the current year benefit of the  company's  new wine
brands,  favorable foreign exchange, and the net effect of restructuring charges
in both segments, the company's operating income grew by 15%.

<PAGE>

Beverages

The Beverage segment  benefited from a healthy  environment for premium spirits,
particularly  in the United States.  Global  depletion  trends for the company's
most important brand, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey,  accelerated in the first
quarter. Depletions are nine-liter case movements from wholesale distributors to
retailers,  and  are  generally  used  in  the  spirits  and  wine  industry  to
approximate  consumer demand.  Jack Daniel's volumes increased at a double-digit
rate in the United  States and in half the  brand's  ten  largest  international
markets.  Southern Comfort  depletions grew in the mid-single digits globally as
Continental  Europe  improved  over its weak  performance  last year.  Finlandia
depletions  continued  to  increase in the United  States and  Poland,  but were
sluggish in other global  markets.  Results for the company's  core wine brands,
Fetzer  Premium  Varietals  and  Bolla,  remained  soft  due  to  the  intensely
competitive  retail price  environment  in the United  States.  However,  Korbel
Champagne grew its volume in the mid-single  digits and  strengthened its market
share leadership in the sparkling wine category.

Beverage  revenue and gross profit increased by 12% and 13%,  respectively,  for
the quarter.  Growth was driven  primarily by higher global volumes and improved
pricing for both Jack  Daniel's  and  Southern  Comfort,  the  establishment  of
initial trade  inventories for One.6  Chardonnay and One.9 Merlot,  and a modest
benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar.

Beverage advertising expenses increased 8% during the quarter,  driven by higher
brand-building  investments behind Jack Daniel's and Finlandia,  and promotional
investments supporting the launch of the new low-carbohydrate wine products.

Consumer Durables

The environment for the company's Lenox business remained very  challenging.  In
the  Durables  segment,  net sales were down 5% and gross  profit  decreased  6%
during the quarter,  despite  increases in revenue and gross profit for Hartmann
luggage.  Lenox sales to  department  stores were sluggish and revenues from the
company's  retail outlets  declined in the first  quarter.  As a result of lower
consumer  response  rates,  revenues  also  declined  in the  direct-to-consumer
channel.

<PAGE>

Consumer  Durables is a seasonal  business that typically  reports a loss in the
first  quarter.  The segment  reported  an  operating  loss of $15 million  this
quarter,  including approximately $3 million in restructuring charges,  compared
to a $12 million loss during the same period last year. The new management  team
at  Lenox  continues  to  focus  its  efforts  on  rationalizing   marginal  and
unprofitable  businesses,   creating  organizational  efficiencies,   increasing
manufacturing and operational  efficiency,  building its brands, and meeting end
consumer needs.

Outlook

First  quarter  financial  results were very strong,  even after  excluding  the
benefit from the company's new low-carbohydrate wine product  introduction,  the
absence of last year's  legal  settlement  and  restructuring  charges,  and the
modest benefit from favorable foreign exchange earnings.  Earnings  expectations
for the full fiscal year,  however,  are tempered by the  competitive  pressures
within the U.S. table wine category and the difficult environment for key pieces
of the Consumer Durables segment.  Additionally,  the company is contemplating a
reduction in field  inventories  resulting  from a  continuing  evolution of its
worldwide distribution system.  However, as a result of its strong first quarter
performance,  and the underlying strength in its premium spirits portfolio,  the
company  is raising  previously  provided  earnings  guidance,  and now  expects
earnings in the range of $2.35 to $2.43 per share for fiscal 2005.

IMPORTANT NOTE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:

This news release contains statements, estimates, or projections that constitute
"forward-looking  statements"  as defined under U.S.  federal  securities  laws.
Generally,   the  words  "expect,"  "believe,"  "intend,"   "estimate,"  "will,"
"anticipate," and "project," and similar expressions  identify a forward-looking
statement,  which speaks only as of the date the  statement  is made.  Except as
required  by law,  we do not  intend to update  or  revise  any  forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

We  believe  that  the   expectations   and  assumptions  with  respect  to  our
forward-looking statements are reasonable. But by their nature,  forward-looking
statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that
in some  cases are out of our  control.  These  factors  could  cause our actual
results to differ materially from  Brown-Forman's  historical  experience or our
present expectations or projections.  Here is a non-exclusive list of such risks
and uncertainties:

 - changes in general economic conditions, particularly in the United States
   where we earn the majority of our profits;
 - a strengthening U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, especially the
   British Pound;
 - reduced bar, restaurant, hotel and travel business in wake of other terrorist
   attacks, such as occurred on 9/11;
 - developments in the class action lawsuits filed against Brown-Forman and
   other spirits, beer and wine manufacturers alleging that our advertising
   causes illegal consumption of alcohol by those under the legal drinking age,
   or other attempts to limit alcohol marketing, through either litigation or
   regulation;
 - a dramatic change in consumer preferences, social trends or cultural trends
   that results in the reduced consumption of our premium spirits brands;
 - tax increases, whether at the federal or state level;
 - increases in the price of grain and grapes;
 - continued depressed retail prices and margins in our wine business because of
   our excess wine inventories, existing grape contract obligations, and a
   world-wide oversupply of grapes; and
 - the effects on our Consumer Durables business of the general economy,
   department store business, response rates in our direct marketing business,
   and profitability of mall outlet operations.
