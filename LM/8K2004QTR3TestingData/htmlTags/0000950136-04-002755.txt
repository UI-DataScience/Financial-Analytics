                            Movie Star, Inc., Reports
           Fiscal 2004 Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year Financial Results

NEW YORK, NEW YORK (AUGUST 24, 2004)--MOVIE STAR, INC. (AMEX: MSI), today
announced financial results for the three months and full year ended June 30,
2004. As expected, the Company experienced significantly lower net sales and
profitability in the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter, compared with the same period
last year. Despite this decline, the balance sheet improved at June 30, 2004
compared with the prior year's statement and the Company made considerable
progress towards expanding future business.

Net sales for the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter decreased 32.2 percent to
$10,524,000 from $15,513,000 for the 2003 final quarter. For the full year, net
sales declined to $53,691,000 from $64,916,000 in the prior year.

For the 2004 fourth quarter, a net loss of $506,000, or $0.03 per share, was
recorded compared with last year's net income of $1,049,000, or $0.07 per
diluted share. The quarterly gross margin decreased 6.5 percent to 25.8 percent
from 32.3 percent in the 2003 comparable period while selling, general and
administrative expenses in the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter increased to
$3,557,000 from last year's $3,311,000.

Mel Knigin, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated: "We view the bottom
line results as a temporary setback that the Company's financial strength easily
withstood. We were pleased to continue to generate positive cash flow in fiscal
2004. At June 30, 2004, Movie Star had no debt and $2,527,000 in cash.
Shareholders' equity increased slightly in 2004 to $17,747,000 from $17,264,000
at June 30, 2003. Furthermore, the manner in which we have continued to closely
manage our balance sheet enabled us to acquire the inventory and other assets of
Sidney Bernstein & Son Lingerie, Inc. and enter into a new credit facility with
HSBC Bank USA."

For fiscal 2004, net income decreased to $128,000, or $0.01 per diluted share,
from $3,431,000, or $0.22 per diluted share, reported last year. For fiscal
2004, the gross margin decreased a modest 1.7 percent to 30.0 percent from last
year's 31.7 percent. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to
$15,824,000 from last year's $14,623,000. The current year included a special
charge of $1,084,000 taken in the third quarter. Had it not been for this
charge, selling, general and administrative expenses would have almost equaled
the prior year's figure.

Mr. Knigin further said, "Management has worked hard in following strategies
that will expand the Company's top line growth beginning this fiscal year even
though we are experiencing certain gross margin pressures. Despite this lower
gross margin, there is a special sense of optimism throughout Movie Star looking
at our next six-month selling cycle based on the additional open orders of the
Sidney Bernstein and Son division. We believe that our top line will begin to
grow starting in the second quarter of this fiscal year. The Sidney Bernstein
and Son division is off to an excellent start. Additionally, the initial
response to our new Maidenform line that is scheduled for delivery in the
beginning of calendar 2005 has been strong."
