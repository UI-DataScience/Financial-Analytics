         National Beverage Corp. Reports First Quarter Profit Increase

    FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 14, 2004--National
Beverage Corp. (AMEX:FIZ) today announced results for its first
quarter ended July 31, 2004. For the quarter, sales were $146.5
million with earnings of $8.9 million, or $.24 per share. For the
prior comparable period, sales were similar and earnings were $8.5
million, or $.23 per share.
    "`OPPORTUNISTICALLY PERFECT' was how we described our status
relative to future possibilities in our earnings release dated July
20, 2004. Nothing has occurred to modify that statement," stated Nick
A. Caporella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
    "Many circumstances affect the purchases of soft drinks and the
current consumer has to deal with more than ever before. `Heightened
Awareness' of just about everything is the explanation for softer than
normal sales during this quarter, which also included increased raw
material costs, while 42 quarters of sustained profits is the work
.... of Team National," continued Caporella.
    "While we continue to adjust pricing, we are 'on course'
strategically with our new product launches and expect these
incremental new revenues to produce higher margins not typical of the
traditional carbonated soft drink industry," Caporella stated.
    "We have previously stated that fiscal year 2005 will surely
provide our best performance to date and we stand solidly with that
statement," concluded Caporella.
    National Beverage produces soft drinks, bottled waters, juices and
juice products and is highly recognized for a line of refreshing
flavors through its popular brands: Shasta(R), Faygo(R), Ritz(R),
Everfresh(R), Mr. Pure(R), LaCroix(R) and Rip It(R).
