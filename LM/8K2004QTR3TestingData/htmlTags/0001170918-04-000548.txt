KIWA BIO-TECH  PRODUCTS  GROUP  CORPORATION  REPORTS  FISCAL 2004 SECOND QUARTER
RESULTS
Monday August 23, 8:30 am ET

LOS ANGELES,  Aug. 23, 2004 - KIWA Bio-tech  Products  Group  Corporation  ("the
Company"  or "KIWA"),  (OTCBB:KWBT.OB)  today  announced  results for the second
quarter of 2004.

Net sales were  $239,759 for the second  quarter  ended June 30, 2004,  compared
with net sales of  $53,458  for the first  quarter  ended  March  31,  2004,  an
increase of more than 400%.  Gross profit for the second  quarter ended June 30,
2004 was  $163,469,  compared with gross profit of $22,447 for the first quarter
ended March 31, 2004, an increase of over 700%.

The increase was  attributable  to the  introduction of a series of new products
and the Company's  expanded  sales and marketing  efforts in China.  On June 29,
2004 the Company  announced  the addition of 17 new  customers  and a government
partnership in Shandong Province.

"We are very pleased with the efforts of our sales and marketing staff in China.
We continue to see increased  commitments from customers who are re-ordering the
product in greater  quantities,"  commented Wei Li, Chairman and CEO of KIWA. Li
added, "Our net sales increased  substantially over the previous quarter, and we
increased  our  gross  profit   significantly  on  a  percentage  basis,   which
demonstrates our efforts to manage our growth."

Net loss  decreased  $893,291 to $756,955 for the second  quarter ended June 30,
2004, as compared to $1,650,246  for the first quarter ended March 31, 2004, but
increased  $681,671  from $75,284 for the three months ended June 30, 2003.  The
decrease from the first quarter is attributable to  significantly  lower reverse
merger related expenses in the second quarter. The increase from the same period
of last year is  primarily  the result of  charges  related  to  consulting  and
professional  fees,  convertible  notes,  and start of  operations in the United
States in April 2004. Included in the net loss for the second quarter ended June
30, 2004 are  approximately  $323,000 of non-cash charges related to convertible
loans and professional services.

Li further stated,  "We have invested heavily in the launch of our United States
operations,  an important  component to our future growth,  and have formed some
important US based  strategic  relationships  that will allow us to enter the US
market  more  quickly.  Our US  operation  will give us the right to market  and
distribute products manufactured by US companies into the Chinese market. We are
confident  that  KIWA  will  meet  its  objectives  and  continue  to grow  both
organically and through partnerships and acquisitions."
