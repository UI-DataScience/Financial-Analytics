Item 2.02  Results of Operations and Financial Condition

On August 13, 2004, HemaCare Corporation issued a press release
(the "Release") announcing financial results for the three
month and six month periods ended June 30, 2004.  A copy was
attached as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company's report on Form 8-K
filed with the SEC on August 13, 2004.

Attached to the Release was a table of condensed consolidated
financial data.  This table inadvertently indicated that (i) the
gross profit for the three month period ended June 30, 2003 was
$6,485,000 instead of the correct amount of $452,000, (ii) the
gross profit for the six month period ended June 30, 2004 was
$10,723,000 instead of the correct amount of $2,934,000, and
(iii) that the gross profit for the six month period ended June
30, 2003 was $12,416,000 instead of the correct amount of
$1,452,000.  All of the other numbers presented in the table of
condensed consolidated financial data were correct as originally
published and are unaffected by this correction.  The information
corrected in this Current Report on Form 8-K was accurately
reported in the Company's report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC
on August 13, 2004.

The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the
exhibits, will not be treated as "filed" for the purposes of
Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the
"Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of
that section.  This information will not be incorporated by
reference into a filing under the Securities Act of 1933, or into
another filing under the Exchange Act, unless that filing
expressly refers to specific information in this report.

                        SIGNATURES

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on
its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
