News Release


Greg Manning Auctions Reports Record Year-End and Fourth Quarter Financial
Results; Strong Market Demand Leads to Record Revenue, Aggregate Sales and Net
Income in Fiscal 2004

WEST CALDWELL, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 9, 2004--Greg Manning Auctions, Inc.
(Nasdaq: GMAI) today announced record financial results for the fourth quarter
and fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.

Revenue, which includes inventory sales plus commission income, climbed 110% in
fiscal 2004 to $212.9 million from $101.2 million in the corresponding period a
year ago. Aggregate sales, which include inventory sales plus consignment sales,
rose 119% to $258.4 million in fiscal 2004 from $118.2 million in the previous
fiscal year. Net income for the year was $29.4 million, or $1.14 per diluted
share, compared to $2.8 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, in fiscal 2003. Net
income in fiscal 2004 included a non-cash tax credit of $4.9 million resulting
from a change in deferred tax valuation recognized in the fourth quarter.
Excluding this tax credit, pro-forma net income in fiscal 2004 was $24.5
million, or $0.95 per diluted share.

In the fourth quarter, revenue rose 103% to $60.7 million from $29.8 million in
the same period last year. Aggregate sales increased 120% to $75.4 from $34.2
million in the fiscal 2003 fourth quarter. Net income in the quarter was $16.3
million, or $0.57 per diluted share, compared to $2.1 million, or $0.17 per
diluted share. Net income in the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter included the
aforementioned tax credit of $4.9 million. Excluding this benefit, net income in
the 2004 fourth quarter was $11.4 million, or $0.39 per diluted share.

Greg Manning, First Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said,
"Our record financial performance in fiscal 2004 exceeded our expectations and
reflects the strong demand in the philatelic and numismatic markets. In
addition, during the year we completed several major acquisitions that we
believe will complement our core competencies in the multibillion-dollar global
collectible market for rare coins and stamps. The Company expanded its global
presence across the U.S., Europe and Asia this past year and currently operates
a total of 16 subsidiaries in six countries, plus Internet auctions. Our
exclusive supplier agreements with Afinsa Bienes Tangibles, SA of Madrid, Spain,
our majority shareholder, contributed approximately $102.2 million in
non-auction sales. Although the agreements do not specify a minimum level of
sales, based on our sales to Afinsa over the past year, we estimate that the
contracts, which can be terminated by either party under certain circumstances,
will generate more than $1 billion in revenue to GMAI over the full ten-year
term of the agreements."

Manning continued, "Our rapid growth also reflects management's ability to
execute its strategic growth plan. In fiscal 2004, pretax profit climbed to
$32.6 million from $3.0 million in fiscal 2003. In addition, gross profit grew
to $61.5 million, or 28.9% of revenue, compared to $14.5 million, or 14.3% of
revenue, in fiscal 2003."

Esteban Perez, Chairman of the Board, added, "We are confident in our ability to
sustain strong internal growth as well as growth through additional
complementary acquisitions. The successful platform we have built provides
substantial growth opportunities that will enable management to drive future
performance and maximize shareholder returns."

In the fourth quarter, Greg Manning Auctions realized approximately $22.1
million in aggregate sales through its coin and stamp companies located in North
America, Europe and Hong Kong as compared to $8.2 million in aggregate sales in
the same period last year. Pretax profit in the fourth quarter totaled $14.4
million compared to $2.3 million in the same period last year and gross profit
was $23.6 million, or 38.9% of revenue, compared to $6.4 million, or 21.5% of
revenue.

Larry Crawford, Chief Financial Officer, said, "Fiscal 2004 was a breakthrough
year for GMAI. In addition to record revenue, aggregate sales and net income,
the Company ended the year in the strongest financial position in its history.
As of June 30, the Company reported a cash position of $16.3 million and $48.4
million in working capital.

"We look forward to fiscal 2005 which will reflect a full year of operations
from our recently acquired companies, including the renowned auction house of
H.R. Harmer of New York, whose acquisition was completed on July 30, 2004. Our
auction line-up for the first half of 2005 is our strongest ever for this
period, with numerous live event sales already scheduled as well as a full line
of Internet auctions. We also recognize the benefits of operating as a public
company, which has manifest itself as a competitive advantage in securing
business with prospective consignors and those who prefer to sell their
collectibles for immediate payment. We intend to continue to enhance our overall
operating leverage as we strengthen our presence in the global marketplace,
particularly in Europe and Asia. Finally, we believe we will solidify our
position as one of the leading collectible companies in the world as exemplified
by our fiscal 2004 results and our excellent prospects for continued growth in
fiscal 2005 and beyond."

The company will broadcast live via the Internet its fourth quarter and year-end
conference call for fiscal 2004 today at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss
financial results, business developments and future outlook. To listen to the
call,
