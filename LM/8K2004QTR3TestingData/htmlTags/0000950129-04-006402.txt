HOUSTON, TEXAS - BLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY (NASDAQ SYMBOL: BDCO)

BLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS

Blue Dolphin Energy Company reported a net loss of $823,406 on revenues of
$345,585 for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, compared to net income of $470,576
on revenues of $1,001,942 for the quarter ended June 30, 2003. The decrease in
second quarter 2004 results was due to lower oil and gas sales revenues of
approximately $600,000 and other expense of approximately $200,000 associated
with a proposed financing transaction that was subsequently terminated in July
2004. Also, June 30, 2003 quarterly results included a gain of approximately
$300,000 recorded from a reduction to the Company's provision for abandonment
costs.

$100,000 and other expense of approximately $200,000 associated with a proposed
financing transaction that was subsequently terminated in July 2004. First half
