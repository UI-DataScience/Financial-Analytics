ELCOM INTERNATIONAL, INC. REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2004 OPERATING RESULTS
PAGE 2

Net sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 increased to $1,709,000 compared
to $669,000 from the same period of 2003, an increase of $1,040,000 or 155%.
License and associated fees increased due primarily to recording the final lump
sum payment from Capgemini UK Plc ("Capgemini", formerly Cap Gemini Ernst and
Young UK Plc) of $1,142,000 which was earned upon signing the thirteenth
customer of the eProcurement Scotland program in the first quarter of 2004 (this
fee is non-recurring). License and associated fees include license fees, hosting
fees, annual fees, joining fees and maintenance fees. Professional services fees
decreased by $112,000 from $259,000 in 2003 to $147,000 in 2004, reflecting less
actual implementations and other professional services activities than were
recorded in the first quarter of 2003.

Operating expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 were $1,673,000 compared
to $2,409,000 in the 2003 quarter, a decrease of $736,000 or 30.6%. Throughout
2003, the Company implemented cost containment measures designed to align its
operating expenses with lower than anticipated revenues. Those measures included
personnel reductions throughout most functional and corporate areas. These
personnel reductions resulted in a decrease in personnel expense in the first
quarter of 2004 of approximately $529,000 when compared to the first quarter of
2003. In March 2004, the Company began hiring several staff in the U.K. and U.S.
(support services) in order to service the expanding demand in the municipal
market in the U.K. and in anticipation of the funding of the Company via the
sale of Regulation S Shares in the U.K. (discussed below). The remaining
decrease in operating expenses from the 2003 quarter to the 2004 quarter is
largely due to a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense, as various
Company assets have been fully depreciated/amortized. The Company's first
quarter operating expenses in 2003 were reduced by the reversal of a franchise
tax accrual of $506,000, as payment was no longer deemed probable.

The Company reported an operating loss from continuing operations of $70,000 for
the quarter ended March 31, 2004 compared to a loss of $1,934,000 reported in
the comparable quarter of 2003, a decrease of $1,864,000 in the loss reported.
This smaller operating loss from continuing operations in the first quarter of
2004 compared to the 2003 quarter was due primarily to the recognition of
revenue from the final lump sum payment from Capgemini, recorded as license and
associated fees revenue and the reduction in operating expenses.

The Company's net loss from continuing operations for the quarter ended March
31, 2004 was $173,000, a decrease of $1,272,000 from the comparable quarterly
loss in 2003 of $1,445,000, as a result of the factors discussed above.

At March 31, 2004, and prior to the sale of the Regulation S Shares, the
Company's principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of
$143,000 and accounts receivable, net of $145,000.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT AFFECTING LIQUIDITY

On April 16, 2004, the Company closed on the sale of 29,777,573 shares of its
Common Stock (the "Regulation S Shares") to investors in the U.K., and listed
the Regulation S Shares and its existing common shares on the AIM Market of the
London Stock Exchange. The Company raised a total of approximately $3.6 million
via this issuance and sale of Regulation S Shares in the U.K, with net proceeds
to the Company of approximately $3.2 million. The Regulation S Shares were sold
at a price equal to the conversion rate of the Company's recent placements of
Debentures in 2003 of $0.1246 per share. The funds derived from the sale of the
Regulation S Shares will be used to support the Company's

working capital requirements.

FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE PERFORMANCE

A significant portion of the Company's revenues from continuing operations in
the first quarter of 2004 (approximately $1,142,000 after currency conversions)
are from recognition of the final lump sum license fee from Capgemini related to
the eProcurement Scotland program. The eProcurement Scotland program is expected
to be an ongoing source of revenues for the Company; however, because this was
the final lump sum payment, which is a non-recurring fee, it is anticipated the
Company's revenues will be lower in the remaining quarters of 2004. If the
Company, in conjunction with Capgemini, the primary contractor for the
eProcurement Scotland program, is unable to perform under this license, it would
have a significant effect on the Company's financial results.

Robert J. Crowell, the Company's Chairman and CEO, stated, "Our first quarter
2004 earnings do not yet reflect the increase in activity under our agreement
with Capgemini associated with the Scottish Executive, which began late last
year. Our first quarter results were substantially enhanced by the recognition
to earnings of our final lump sum payment from Capgemini associated with the
Scottish Executive. Our underlying recurring revenues remain generally
consistent with Professional Services slightly less when compared to last year.
With our sales pipeline expanding, I expect to see continued increases in
activity under the Capgemini agreement, and with other channel partners and
opportunities."

Mr. Crowell continued, "We are extremely pleased at our successful placement of
shares in the U.K. and subsequent listing on the Alternative Investment Market
("AIM"), which was effective April 16, 2004. With this financing in place, the
Company filed its Amendment Number 2 to its Form 10-K on May 10, 2004. This
amended filing contains an unqualified audit opinion as the Company is now
regarded as a `going concern'. The Company now stands to benefit from having a
more secure financial foundation and believes 2004 will represent a new
beginning for the Company as we begin to expand, especially through our channel
partners."

ELCOM INTERNATIONAL, INC. REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2004 OPERATING RESULTS
PAGE 2

Net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 increased to $598,000 from
$531,000 in the same period of 2003, an increase of $67,000, or 13%.
Professional services revenue increased primarily due an increase in
implementation activities in the U.K. related to the Scottish Executive's
eProcurement Scotland program. Licenses and associated fees decreased primarily
as a result of reduced licensing activity in the U.S. in 2004 versus 2003. The
decrease in licenses and associated fees was more than offset by the increase in
Professional services revenue.

Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") for the quarter ended June
30, 2004 were $1,465,000 compared to $2,457,000 in the 2003 quarter, a decrease
of $992,000 or 40%. Throughout the first three quarters of 2003, the Company
implemented cost containment measures designed to align its SG&A expenses with
lower than anticipated revenues. Those measures included personnel reductions
throughout most functional and corporate areas. Reductions in personnel resulted
in a decrease in personnel expense in the second quarter of 2004 of
approximately $333,000 when compared to the second quarter of 2003. In March
2004, the Company began hiring several support services staff in the U.K. and
U.S. in order to service the expanding demand in the municipal market in the
U.K. and in anticipation of the funding of the Company via the sale of
Regulation S Shares. The remaining decrease in SG&A from the 2003 quarter to the
2004 quarter is due largely to a reduction in depreciation and amortization
expense, as various Company assets have been fully depreciated/amortized, as
well as credits negotiated with two service providers which resulted in one-time
credits of $196,000 in the 2004 quarter.

The Company reported a $1,020,000 operating loss from continuing operations for
the quarter ended June 30, 2004 compared to a loss of $2,129,000 reported in the
comparable quarter of 2003, a decrease in the reported loss of $1,109,000, or
52%. This smaller operating loss from continuing operations in the first quarter
of 2004 compared to the 2003 quarter was due to both the reduction in SG&A and
the increase in net sales.

The Company's net loss from continuing operations for the quarter ended June 30,
2004 was $1,072,000, a decrease of $1,114,000 or 51% from the comparable
quarterly loss in 2003 of $2,186,000, as a result of the factors discussed
above.

Net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2004 increased to $2,307,000 from
$1,200,000 in the same period of 2003, an increase of $1,107,000. Licenses and
associated fees increased primarily due to recording the fourth and final lump
sum license payment from Capgemini UK Plc ("Capgemini", formerly, Cap Gemini
Ernst and Young UK Plc) of $1,142,000 which was earned upon signing the
thirteenth customer of the eProcurement Scotland program in the first quarter of
2004 (this license fee is non-recurring). Professional services fees increased
by $114,000, from $505,000 in 2003 to $619,000 in 2004, reflecting more
implementation work and other professional services activities than were
recorded in the first six months of 2003.

SG&A for the six months ended June 30, 2004 was $3,138,000 compared to
$4,807,000 in the first half of 2003, a decrease of $1,669,000 or 35%.
Throughout the first three quarters of 2003, the Company implemented cost
containment measures designed to align its SG&A expenses with lower than
anticipated revenues. Those measures included personnel reductions throughout
most functional and corporate areas. Reductions in personnel resulted in a
decrease in personnel expense in the first six months of 2004 of approximately
$861,000 when compared to the first six months of 2003. In March 2004, the
Company began hiring several support services staff in the U.K. and U.S. in

Company via the sale of Regulation S Shares. The remaining decrease in SG&A from
the first half of 2003 to the first half of 2004 is due largely to a reduction
in depreciation and amortization expense, as various Company assets have been
fully depreciated/amortized, as well as credits negotiated with two service
providers which resulted in one-time credits of $196,000 in the 2004 period. In
the first half of 2003 the Company's SG&A expenses were reduced by the reversal
of a franchise tax accrual of $506,000, as payment was no longer deemed
probable.

The Company reported an operating loss from continuing operations of $1,090,000
for the six months ended June 30, 2004 compared to a loss of $4,063,000 reported
in the comparable six months of 2003, a decrease in the reported loss of 73%, or
$2,973,000. This smaller operating loss from continuing operations in the first
six months of 2004 compared to the first half of 2003 was due to both the
reduction in SG&A and the increase in license and associated fees revenue in the
first quarter of 2004, as described above.

The Company's net loss from continuing operations for the six months ended June
30, 2004 was $1,245,000, a decrease of $2,386,000 from the $3,631,000 loss
reported in the first half of 2003, as a result of the factors discussed above.

Robert J. Crowell, the Company's Chairman and CEO, stated, "Our second quarter
2004 earnings do not yet reflect the full anticipated increase in activity under
our agreement with Capgemini associated with the Scottish Executive, which began
late last year. Our 2004 six-month results were substantially enhanced by the
recognition of our final lump sum payment from Capgemini associated with the
Scottish Executive. Elcom's sales pipeline is still strong but has slowed a bit
during the summer months; however the Company is in the process of responding to
several tender requests and anticipates activity to accelerate after the summer.
I expect to see more activity with our channel partners and additional
opportunities in the municipal market in the U.K."

FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE PERFORMANCE

A significant portion of the Company's revenues from continuing operations in
the first quarter of 2004 (approximately $1,142,000 after currency conversions)
are from recognition of the final lump sum license fee from Capgemini related to
the eProcurement Scotland program. The eProcurement Scotland program is expected
to be an ongoing source of revenues for the Company; however, because this was
the final lump sum payment and is a non-recurring fee, it is anticipated the
Company's revenues from this source will be lower in the remaining quarters of
2004.
