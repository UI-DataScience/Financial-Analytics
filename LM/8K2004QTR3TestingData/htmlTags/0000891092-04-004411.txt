                             Fiscal 2004 at $0.44

    NEWPORT BEACH, Calif., Sept 10 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Collectors
Universe, Inc. (Nasdaq: CLCT), the leading provider of value-added grading and
authentication services and products to dealers and collectors of high-end
collectibles, today announced financial results for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2004 with annual earnings of $1,730,000, or $0.27 per diluted share,
which included income from continuing operations of $2,798,000, or $0.44 per
diluted share, and a loss from discontinued operations of $1,068,000, or a
loss of $0.17 per diluted share. Net revenues were $26.4 million for the
fiscal year 2004, up $6.1 million, or 30%, from $20.3 million for the fiscal
year 2003.

    Financial Highlights:

    Fourth Quarter 2004

    -- Net revenues, which consist of grading and authentication services,
       increased 31%, as the number of collectible coins graded increased by
       30% and the total number of collectible units graded increased by
       17% overall, in each case as compared to the fourth quarter last year.
    -- Gross profit margin from increased to 67% from 64% over the
       corresponding period last year.
    -- Income from continuing operations increased to $1.3 million, or
       $0.20 per diluted share from $0.5 million or $0.08 per diluted share in
       the fourth quarter of 2003.
    -- Net income, inclusive of a loss from discontinued (collectibles sales)
       operations of $534,000, increased to $785,000 from a net loss of
       $1.3 million or $0.21 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2003.

    Year Ended June 30, 2004

    -- Net revenues increased 30% to $26.4 million from $20.3 million for
       fiscal 2003, as the number of collectible coins graded increased by
       35%, and the total number of collectible units graded increased by
       16% overall, in each case as compared to fiscal 2003.
    -- Income from continuing operations increased to $2.8 million, or
       $0.44 per diluted share from $736,000, or $0.12 per diluted share, in
       fiscal 2003.
    -- Net income, inclusive of a loss from discontinued operations of nearly
       $1.1 million, increased to $1.7 million, or $0.27 per diluted share
       from a net loss of $10.4 million (inclusive of a goodwill impairment
       charge of $1.4 million and a cumulative effect of accounting change of
       $8.9 million).
    -- The Company ended fiscal 2004 with a strong cash position of
       $21.5 million.

    Fiscal Fourth Quarter Results
    Continuing operations consist primarily of grading and authentication
services for coins, sportscards, stamps and autographs.
    Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income. Income from continuing
operations increased to $1.3 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the
fourth quarter of 2004 from $791,000, or $0.13 per diluted share for the
immediately preceding quarter of 2004 and $508,000 or $0.08 per diluted share
in the fourth quarter of 2003. However, discontinued operations, comprised of
our collectibles sales businesses, recorded a loss of $534,000 or $0.08 per
diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, as compared to a gain of
$201,000 or $0.03 per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter of
fiscal 2004 and a loss of $1.8 million or $0.29 per diluted share in the
fourth quarter of 2003.
    As a result, Collectors Universe recorded a net profit of $785,000, or
$0.12 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2004, as compared to net
profit of $992,000 or $0.16 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal
2004 and a net loss of $1.3 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, in the fourth
quarter of 2003.
    Net Revenues. Net revenues increased 31% to $7.8 million in the fourth
quarter of 2004 from $5.9 million in the corresponding period last year.
Driving the year-over-year top-line growth was a 17% increase in total
collectible units graded to 649,000 units compared with 553,000 units for the
fourth quarter of 2003. The balance of the revenue increase was primarily due
to a shift in the mix of collectibles being graded to a greater proportion of
collectible coins, which carry a higher average grading fee than sportscards.
    Gross Profit and SG&A. Gross profit increased 37% to $5.2 million in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 from $3.8 million in the year-ago quarter, while
gross profit margin improved to 67% from 64% in the fourth quarter last year.
The Company continued to demonstrate progress in improving operating
efficiency. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased only
slightly to $3.5 million in the 2004 fourth fiscal quarter from $3.4 million
in the corresponding prior-year period, notwithstanding 31% increase in net
revenues. As a result, as a percentage of net revenues, SG&A declined to
45% in the fourth quarter of 2004 from 57%, in the same quarter last year.

    Fiscal Year 2004 Results
    Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income.  Income from continuing
operations increased to $2.8 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, in the
twelve months ended June 30, 2004, from $736,000, or $0.12 per diluted share,
in the prior year. Discontinued operations incurred a loss of nearly
$1.1 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the twelve months ended June 30,
2004. As a result, we recorded net profits for fiscal 2004 of $1.7 million, or
$0.27 per diluted share.
    By comparison, for fiscal 2003, the Company incurred a net loss of
$10.4 million, or $1.66 per diluted share. These results included a non-cash
goodwill impairment charge of $56,000 or $0.01 per diluted share, in
continuing operations recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle and a loss from discontinued operations of $11.1 million,
or $1.77 per diluted share, which included an impairment charge of
$1.4 million and cumulative effect of accounting change of $8.9 million.
    Net Revenues. Net revenues increased 30% to $26.4 million in fiscal year
2004 from $20.3 million for fiscal 2003. The increase in fiscal 2004 resulted
from a 16% growth in total collectibles units graded and authenticated to
2,323,000 units in 2004 from 2,002,000 last year and a shift in the mix of
total items graded to a greater proportion of collectible coins.
    Gross Profit and SG&A. Gross profit increased 37% to $17.3 million in
fiscal year 2004, from $12.6 million last year, reflecting the increase in
higher margin coin grading submissions relative to sportscard and stamp
grading submissions. Year over year, the gross profit margin rose to 65% in
fiscal 2004 from 62% in fiscal 2003, as the growth in revenues drove down the
fixed elements in cost of sales as a percent of total revenues. SG&A increased
by only 4% to $13.0 million in the 2004 fiscal period from $12.5 million in
the prior year, despite the 30% increase in net revenues in 2004. As a result,
as a percentage of net revenues SG&A improved to 49% in fiscal 2004 from 62%
in fiscal 2003.

    Fiscal 2004 was a Turning Point
    "Our 2004 fiscal year marked a turning point in our history as we made
strategic decisions to reposition the Company in order to take advantage of
our leading brands in the service business of grading and authenticating
collectibles and to exit the commerce business in the buying, selling and
auctioning collectibles," explained Chief Executive Officer Michael Haynes.
"Additionally, we achieved our objectives to quickly and efficiently sell our
discontinued operations during the second half of the fiscal year and in an
orderly fashion, liquidate substantially all of our inventories and collect
our receivables from those operations. As a result of all of these efforts, we
are reporting excellent annual earnings, and our continuing grading and
authentication operations, although currently smaller in annual revenue, have
recast the Company as one with lower volatility of revenues, lower balance
sheet risk, higher gross margin, excellent brand recognition and focused
management, all for the purpose of growing our continuing businesses."

    Improved Financial Condition
    At June 30, 2004, Collectors Universe had cash and cash equivalents of
$21.5 million compared with cash and cash equivalents of $4.5 million at
fiscal year end June 30, 2003. Continuing operations provided net cash of
$6.1 million in fiscal 2004, compared with $838,000 in the prior year. The two
main sources of the cash inflow in 2004 were $2.8 million net income from
continuing operations and $1.2 million of refundable income taxes. Investing
activities provided $1,852,000 in fiscal 2004 compared to cash used of
$294,000 in the prior year. Financing activities generated cash flows of
$924,000 compared to $16,000 in fiscal 2003.
    In addition, discontinued operations provided $8.1 million cash in fiscal
2004 in contrast to a cash outflow of $1.0 million in 2003.
    Inventories at June 30, 2004 totaled $452,000, as compared with
$180,000 at the end of fiscal 2003.
    Assets totaled $33.7 million at June 30, 2004, compared with $32.3 million
at fiscal year end 2003, and assets of discontinued operations held for sale
accounted for $1.4 million and $16 million, respectively, of the total.
    Total stockholders' equity was $29 million at June 30, 2004, compared with
$26.3 million at June 30, 2003. The Company currently has no debt.

    Fiscal 2005 Outlook
    Mr. Haynes stated, "As we stand at the threshold of the initial year of
our new strategy, we are enthusiastic about a return to our founding premise
of ending 'buyer beware' in the markets we serve and extending our excellent
value proposition inherent in our services into other markets for collectibles
and high value assets. Our cash position provides us with a significant
resource for enhancing our current market share and continuing our momentum
along with the prospect for careful and selective acquisitions that will
enable us to enter new markets where third party validation can add
significant value and facilitate transactions."

    Forward-Looking Statements
    This news release contains statements regarding our expectations about our
future financial performance that are "forward-looking statements" as defined
in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking
statements can be identified by the use of words such as "believe," "expect,"
"anticipate," "intend," "plan," "estimate," "project," or words of similar
meaning, or future or conditional verbs such as "will," "would," "should,"
"could," or "may." Our actual results and business in the future may differ,
possibly materially, from our current expectations as set forth in the forward
looking statements contained in this release due to a number of risks and
uncertainties. Those risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:
changes in general economic conditions, and changes in conditions in the
collectibles markets in which we operate, such as a possible decline in the
popularity of some high-end collectibles, either of which could reduce the
volume of grading submissions and, therefore, the grading fees we generate; a
lack of diversity in our sources of revenues and, more particularly, our
dependence on collectible coin grading for a significant percentage of our
total revenues, which makes us vulnerable to declines in revenues and income
should there be declines in collectibles grading submissions generally or,
more particularly, in collectible coin submissions which can be caused by a
decline in the value of precious metals over which we do not have control; and
our dependence on a limited number of key management personnel the loss of any
of which could adversely affect future financial performance. Certain of these
risks and uncertainties, in addition to other risks, are more fully described
in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2003, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition,
although we believe that our strategy to exit the commerce segment of our
business and focus substantially all of our resources on our grading and
services segment will better enable us to achieve improvements in the
profitability, there is no assurance that our strategy will prove to be
successful. Among other things, one consequence of our strategy is that there
will be a significant decline in our revenues. As a result, our profitability
will suffer if we are unable to reduce our general and administrative expenses
to bring them in line with our lower revenue base. Also, there is a practical
limit on the amount by which expenses can be reduced as a means of improving
profitability. As a result, our success in the future will depend as well on
our ability to achieve internal growth in our grading businesses and to find
and take advantage of opportunities to acquire other businesses that provide
value added services to the collectibles markets. There is no assurance that
we will be able to achieve such growth and growth by acquisition presents a
number of risks including an inability to integrate newly acquired businesses
into existing operations successfully and the potential that such acquisitions
will result in increased operating costs that will adversely affect operating
income and profits.
    These forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this news
release, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise the
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise.
