                      C&D TECHNOLOGIES REPORTS EARNINGS FOR
                           SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2005


BLUE BELL, Pa., August 26, 2004 -- C&D Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: CHP), a leading
North American  producer and marketer of electrical power storage and conversion
products used in telecommunications and industrial applications, today announced
financial results for its second quarter ended July 31, 2004. Net income for the
quarter  was $3.2  million,  or 13 cents per  diluted  share,  compared  to $3.6
million or 14 cents per diluted  share in the prior year's second  quarter.  Net
sales for the quarter were $94.4 million, a 16.0% increase from the prior year's
second quarter sales of $81.4 million.

For the six months ended July 31, 2004, net income was $5.2 million, or 20 cents
per diluted share,  compared to $6.4 million,  or 25 cents per diluted share, in
the  prior  year's  comparable  period.  Net sales for the  period  were  $180.2
million,  a 13.5%  increase  from the prior  year's  comparable  period sales of
$158.7 million.

The  acquisitions of Datel,  Inc. and Celab,  Ltd.,  completed during the second
quarter,  added $7.4  million of sales to the second  quarter  and  year-to-date
results.

Wade H.  Roberts,  Jr.,  president and chief  executive  officer of the company,
said,  "C&D  Technologies  continued  to gain sales  momentum  during the second
quarter,  with all three of its  operating  divisions  growing  organically.  In
addition,  we are pleased with the initial  financial  performance  of Datel and
Celab,  with each  acquisition  contributing  to  earnings  during the  quarter.
However, the price of lead continued to negatively affect financial  performance
in the Motive  Power and Standby  Power  divisions,  and we  estimate  that lead
pricing reduced  earnings per share by approximately 16 cents during the quarter
compared to last year's second quarter."

C&D Technologies'  second quarter operating results by reporting segment were as
follows:

Standby Power - Sales increased 3.6% in the quarter, to $61.5 million from $59.4
million in the prior year's second quarter. The increase was driven by increased
sales to the UPS market.  Operating  income was $5.8  million,  compared to $8.3
million in the  year-ago  quarter.  The  Standby  Power  Division  continued  to
experience  high  raw  material  costs  (principally  lead),  as well  as  plant
transition expenses during the second quarter,  the latter,  associated with the
start-up of production at the Reynosa,  Mexico plant  acquired last year.  These
combined costs negatively  impacted the current quarter's  operating income by a
total of approximately $5.9 million.

Power  Electronics - Sales  increased 89.7% during the quarter to $19.0 million,



 <PAGE>



from $10.0  million in the prior year's  second  quarter.  The revenue  increase
reflected $7.4 million from acquisitions  closed during the quarter,  as well as
improved  demand for DC to DC products.  Operating  income in the second quarter
was $2.9  million,  compared  to an  operating  loss of  $391,000  in the second
quarter of fiscal 2004.  Excluding the  acquisition-related  revenues  mentioned
above,  Power Electronics  Division revenues for the quarter were $11.7 million,
an increase of 16.2% from the second quarter of fiscal 2004.

Motive Power - Sales  increased  16.1% in the second  quarter to $13.9  million,
from $12.0  million in the prior  year's  second  quarter,  as both  battery and
charger sales improved. The division's operating loss was $2.0 million, compared
to an operating loss of $1.6 million in the prior year's quarter. Motive Power's
operating loss was also negatively  affected by increased raw material costs and
the plant  transition  expenses,  previously  referred to, which  increased  the
division's current quarter operating loss by approximately $1.8 million.

In commenting on the outlook for the third quarter,  Mr. Roberts  stated,  "Thus
far in fiscal 2005,  sales growth has been solid.  We continue to be hit hard by
raw material  pricing as well as the anticipated  plant startup costs.  However,
overall,  financial  results improved from the previous  quarter,  and we expect
this trend to continue into the next  quarter,  as the  transition  costs to our
Reynosa,  Mexico  facility wind down.  Accordingly,  we are  projecting  diluted
earnings per share in the range of 13 to17 cents for the third  quarter based on
the assumption that lead pricing does not worsen."
