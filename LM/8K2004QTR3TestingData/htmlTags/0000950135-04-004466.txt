                      ALPHA TECHNOLOGIES GROUP FISCAL 2004
                       THIRD QUARTER REVENUE INCREASED 25%


     LOS ANGELES, CA, September 13, 2004 -- ALPHA TECHNOLOGIES GROUP, INC.
(NASDAQ:ATGI) today announced financial results for the third quarter and first
nine months of fiscal 2004.

     For the three months ended July 25, 2004, revenue increased 25% to
$14,548,000 from $11,658,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2003. Operating
income increased to $230,000. This compares to an operating loss for last year's
third quarter of $13,716,000, which included non-cash charges for the impairment
of goodwill and other intangible assets that totaled $13,303,000. The Company
reported a loss of $213,000, or $0.03 per share, for this year's third quarter,
compared to a loss of $13,871,000, or $1.95 per share, for the same quarter last
year.

     For the nine months ended July 25, 2004, revenue increased 16% to
$40,983,000 from $35,288,000 for the same period of fiscal 2003. Operating
income was $337,000 for the first nine months of fiscal 2004. This compares to
an operating loss of $14,058,000 for the same period a year ago, which included
the non-cash impairment charges mentioned above. The loss for this year's first
nine months was $1,040,000, or $0.15 per share. This compares to a loss of
$14,692,000, or $2.07 per share, for the first nine months of fiscal 2003.

     CEO Larry Butler said, "Revenue and operating income have now increased for
three consecutive quarters. Also encouraging is that gross margin for this
year's third quarter improved to 13% from 10% for the same period last year. New
orders booked during the third quarter were ahead of prior year and comparable
to second quarter bookings. We remain focused on keeping our costs under control
and paying down our debt as rapidly as possible."

     Butler noted that Alpha had an excess cash flow payment of $895,000 due to
its lenders on September 22, 2004. As a result of the tightening of credit terms
from its aluminum suppliers, Alpha does not have cash available to make such
payment. It has requested that the lenders waive such payment. To date, the
lenders have agreed to forebear for the balance of the calendar year from
enforcing any rights or remedies arising from such non-payment. Consequently,
all of the Company's debt has been classified as current in the fiscal 2004
third quarter financial statements. Butler said that the Company is in
discussions with its lenders regarding a restructuring of its loan agreement,
and expects that an amended loan agreement will be reached on a timely basis.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

     EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) for
the third quarter of fiscal 2004 was approximately $903,000. For the first nine
months of fiscal 2004, EBITDA was approximately $2,443,000.

     The following table reconciles GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures:

     We have included the discussion of EBITDA in this press release as a
"non-GAAP financial measure," which is a measure of our historical performance
that is different from measures calculated and presented in accordance with
GAAP. Management and the Company's lenders, use EBITDA to determine compliance
with its debt covenants, and Management uses it as an important measure in
evaluating and forecasting the Company's performance.
