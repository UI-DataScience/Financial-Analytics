              LANNETT COMPANY REPORTS EARNINGS RESULTS FOR ITS 4TH
                          QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR 2004


         PHILADELPHIA, PA -- August 20, 2004 -- LANNETT COMPANY, INC. (AMEX:
LCI). The Company's annual results of operations for the fiscal year ended June
30, 2004 (Fiscal 2004) surpassed last year's record highs in sales, operating
income and net income.

         Net sales increased from $42.5 million in Fiscal 2003 to $63.8 million
in Fiscal 2004. Net sales rose from $12.2 million in the fourth quarter of
Fiscal 2003 to $18.0 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. These
increases were due primarily to recent introductions of new products, including
Levothyroxine Sodium tablets and the branded product, Unithroid(R) tablets. In
addition, the Company successfully increased its market share and sales revenue
for several of its other products.

         Gross profit margins decreased from 62% in Fiscal 2003 to 58% in Fiscal
2004, and from 63% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003 to 53% in the fourth
quarter of Fiscal 2004. The decrease in gross profit margins is a result of a
decrease in net weighted average prices for some of the Company's products due
to increased market competition, and increases in direct and indirect costs,
including raw material prices, compensation and benefit expenses and
depreciation expense.

         Research and development (R&D) expenses increased due to the Company's
continued strategy of investing a portion of its profits in the development of
new

<PAGE>

generic drug products. Total R&D expenses increased from $2.6 million in Fiscal
2003 to $5.9 million in Fiscal 2004, and from $900,000 in the fourth quarter of
Fiscal 2003 to $2.4 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. A significant
portion of the increases in R&D expenses represents the cost of performing
generic bioequivalence tests, which is commonly required for ANDA submissions.
The Company incurred approximately $2.3 million in Fiscal 2004 for
bioequivalence testing fees, compared to $265,000 in Fiscal 2003. The remainder
of the increase in R&D expenses was due to an increase in compensation and
benefit expenses and costs of raw materials used in the R&D process.

         Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased from $4.3
million in Fiscal 2003 to $8.9 million in Fiscal 2004, and from $1.1 million in
the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003 to $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of
Fiscal 2004. SG&A expenses increased due to an increase in compensation and
benefit expenses, insurance premiums, professional service fees, consulting
services, advertising and other marketing expenses.

         Included in the Fiscal 2004 results of operations are approximately
$1.4 million in operating expenses not expected to recur in Fiscal 2005,
including approximately $830,000 in incentive compensation costs, $270,000 in
legal and consulting fees related to the Company's successful efforts to prevent
a local union from organizing a portion of their employees and approximately
$300,000 in other expenses, including fees for work performed by or under the
direction of the Special Committee of the

<PAGE>


Board of Directors, which was created as a result of an option granted by
William Farber, the Company's Chairman and majority stockholder, to Perrigo
Company, Inc. for the acquisition of shares owned by Mr. Farber and his wife,
and any potential subsequent transaction between Perrigo Company, Inc. (Perrigo)
and the remaining stockholders of the Company. As previously disclosed, Perrigo
chose not to exercise the option previously granted.

         The Company's results of operations also include approximately $1.3
million in non-cash amortization expense related to the intangible asset created
by an agreement whereby the Company exchanged four million (4,000,000) shares of
its capital stock to Jerome Stevens Pharmaceutical, Inc. (JSP) for the exclusive
marketing and distribution rights to JSP's line of products. Operating income
before the $1.3 million in amortization expense was $4.5 million for the fourth
quarter of Fiscal 2004, compared to $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of the
prior year. The decrease is a result of the increases in R&D and SG&A expenses.
On an annual basis, operating income before the $1.3 million in amortization
expense was $22.1 million for Fiscal 2004, compared to $19.3 million in Fiscal
2003.

         Net income decreased from $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal
2003 to $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004 as a result of the
amortization expense and the increases in R&D and SG&A expenses. On an annual
basis, net income increased from $11.7 million in Fiscal 2003 to $13.2 million
in Fiscal 2004.
