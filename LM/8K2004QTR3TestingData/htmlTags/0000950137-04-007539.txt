SALTON REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-END RESULTS

DOMESTIC OPERATIONS GENERATE FIRST QUARTER OF REVENUE GROWTH SINCE FISCAL YEAR
2002; COST CUTTING INITIATIVES AHEAD OF TARGETS


LAKE FOREST, Ill., -- Salton, Inc. (NYSE: SFP) announced today its fiscal 2004
results for the fourth quarter and full year ended July 3, 2004. The Company
reported net sales of $249.7 million for the fourth quarter, versus $189.2
million for the fiscal 2003 fourth quarter. Salton reported a loss of $50.2
million, or $(4.42) per share, versus a loss of $8.8 million or $(0.79) per
share for the same period of 2003. Net sales increased due to the inclusion of
an additional $42.5 million in sales from Amalgamated Appliances Holdings
Limited ("AMAP") as a result of growth and the inclusion of a full fourth
quarter of sales. The Company had $9.4 million in favorable currency effects and
$5.8 million of growth in other international operations. Domestic sales grew by
$2.8 million, the first increase in the U.S. since the 2002 fiscal year. The
George Foreman product line posted a global increase in sales of 7.1% for the
fourth quarter.

The loss in the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter included a $23.6 million pre-tax
charge associated with the U.S. restructuring plans. The restructuring charge
consists of $20.2 million related to the write-down of certain inventory
identified for liquidation as part of the Company's decision to rationalize
warehouse and distribution facilities; $1.7 million for the discontinuation of
several marketing programs; $1.2 million of consulting and legal costs directly
associated with the development and implementation of the restructuring plans
and $0.5 million in severance.

The fourth quarter also reflects pre-tax charges taken related to the
restructuring efforts and subsequent valuation reviews in light of those
decisions, which include a $6.5 million intangible asset impairment charge and a
$3.8 million fixed asset charge primarily related to tooling.

Other items impacting the 2004 fourth quarter results include a $6.9 million
charge for the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain foreign
income tax credits and a $5.0 million pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment
of debt.

Excluding these restructuring charges and other items, the Company would have
reported a fourth quarter net loss of $19.2 million, versus a net loss of $8.8
million in the fiscal 2003 fourth quarter. A reconciliation of the amounts is
included in the supplemental schedule contained in this press release. These
non-GAAP measurements are provided to help investors understand the Company's
financial results given the significant impact of the U.S. operation's
restructuring activities. Future restructuring charges related to the closure of
facilities and other items are expected to be less than $2.0 million.

For the full-year, the Company reported net sales of $1.1 billion versus $894.9
million in the fiscal 2003 period. Net sales increased due to the inclusion of
an additional $206.4 million in sales for a full year of AMAP. The Company had
$29.2 million in favorable currency effects and $12.6 million of growth in other
international operations. These increases were offset by a $66.5 million decline
in the domestic market primarily due to a decrease in George Foreman product
sales in the first part of the year. For the full-year, Salton reported a net
loss of $95.2 million, or $(8.45) per share, versus net income of $8.0 million,
or $0.53 per diluted share in the fiscal 2003 period. Excluding the
aforementioned charges for the fourth quarter and a non-cash intangible asset
write-off of $34.3 million in the third quarter, Salton would have reported a
loss of $38.2 million for the 2004 fiscal year, versus net income of $8.5
million for the 2003 fiscal year. A


<PAGE>


reconciliation of the amounts is included in a supplemental schedule that is
contained in this press release.

On May 11, 2004, Salton announced a decision to restructure its U.S. operations
under a plan to reduce annual domestic operating expenses by a minimum of $40.0
million through a 25% reduction in U.S. personnel, the closure of several
facilities, a reduction in advertising, infomercial and cooperative advertising
expenses, and other consolidation and cost reduction initiatives. During the
month of July, the Company's SG&A and distribution cost reductions exceeded
budgeted expectations. The Company expects that the reduction in annual domestic
operating expenses resulting from its U.S. restructuring plan will exceed $40.0
million.

"Since we announced plans to restructure our U.S. operations, we have
aggressively pursued initiatives to realign our domestic cost structure with our
current level of domestic revenue," said Leonhard Dreimann, Salton's Chief
Executive Officer. "These actions have lowered our operating costs in the U.S.,
allowing us to significantly improve our operating results going forward. Our
fourth quarter sales results, which included our first quarter of revenue growth
in the U.S. in two years, suggest domestic sales are stabilizing. Recently, we
entered into an amended revolving credit agreement, which has increased our
financial flexibility and will allow us to meet our working capital needs during
the holiday season. Our international operations continue to generate strong
growth, as results from South Africa, Europe and Australia continue to underpin
our business."

Business Outlook:

"Although we have been highly focused on reducing costs domestically, Salton is
recognized as an innovator in product development, and introduced over 40 new
products at the Housewares Show last Spring," continued Mr. Dreimann. "We have
already seen strong interest from retailers for the George Foreman The Next
Grilleration(TM), which has removable grilling plates, making cleaning easier.
We are confident that the added convenience provided by this new grill will
trigger a replacement cycle among our existing customers. In addition to the
Foreman line of grills, we introduced many new products at the Housewares Show
which were well received."

The Company's executives will hold a conference call today that will take place
at 9:00 a.m. ET. Leonhard Dreimann, Chief Executive Officer, William Rue,
President and Chief Operating Officer and David Mulder, Executive Vice
President, Chief Administrative Officer and Senior Financial Officer will host
the call. Interested participants should call (800) 472-8309 when calling within
the United States or (706) 643-9561 when calling internationally. Please
reference Conference I.D. Number 9722640. There will be a playback available two
hours after the call is completed. The playback will be available until
midnight, September 22, 2004. To listen to the playback, please call (800)
642-1687 when calling within the United States or (706) 645-9291 when calling
internationally. Please use Conference I.D. 9722640 for the replay.

This call is being webcast and can be accessed at Salton's web site at
www.saltoninc.com until September 22, 2004. The conference call can be found

Non-GAAP Measurements

In addition to the reported GAAP results provided throughout this document, the
Company has provided non-GAAP measurements that present earnings excluding
specified items affecting


<PAGE>


comparability. Details of the items are presented in the tables within this
document. Reconciliations from GAAP reported results to non-GAAP reported
measurements described in this press release are provided in the financial
tables attached to this document. Also, reconciliations from GAAP reported
results to non-GAAP measurements that may be discussed on this morning's
earnings conference call can be found on Salton's Web site at
www.saltoninc.com.

Salton, Inc. has provided these non-GAAP measurements as a way to help investors
better understand earnings and enhance comparisons of our earnings from period
to period. Among other things, our management uses the earnings results,
excluding items affecting comparability, to evaluate the performance of its
businesses. There are inherent limitations in the use of earnings, excluding
items affecting comparability, because actual results do include the impact of
these items. The non-GAAP measures are intended only as a supplement to the
comparable GAAP measures and we compensate for the limitations inherent in the
use of non-GAAP measures by using GAAP measures in conjunction with the non-GAAP
measures. As a result, investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in
addition to, and not in substitution for, or as superior to, measures of
financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

quality small appliances, home decor and personal care products. Our product mix

Certain matters discussed in this news release are forward-looking statements
that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking
statements. These factors include: Salton's ability to realize the benefits it
expects from its U.S. restructuring plan; Salton's substantial indebtedness and
restrictive covenants in Salton's debt instruments; Salton's ability to access
the capital markets on attractive terms or at all; Salton's relationship and
contractual arrangements with key customers, suppliers and licensors; pending
legal proceedings; cancellation or reduction of orders; the timely development,
introduction and customer acceptance of Salton's products; dependence on foreign
suppliers and supply and manufacturing constraints; competitive products and
pricing; economic conditions and the retail environment; the availability and
success of future acquisitions; international business activities; the risks
related to intellectual property rights; the risks relating to regulatory
matters and other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in Salton's

Pro Forma Non-GAAP Only

The above pro forma non-GAAP statements are based upon the Company's unaudited
consolidated statements of operations for the periods shown, with certain
adjustments. This presentation is not in accordance with, or an alternative for,
U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and may not be consistent
with the presentation used by other companies. However, Salton believes pro
forma non-GAAP reporting provides meaningful insight into the company's ongoing
economic performance and therefore uses pro forma non-GAAP reporting internally
in evaluating and managing the Company's operations. Salton has chosen to
provide this supplemental information to investors to enable them to perform
additional comparisons of operating results and to illustrate the results of
ongoing operations.
