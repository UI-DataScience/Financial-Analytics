"The increase in the annual gross profit margin  demonstrates the success of the
restructuring plan implemented in the last quarter of fiscal 2003", stated Kevin
Simpson,  President  and  Chief  Operating  Officer.  "This  restructuring  plan

<PAGE>

included  an increase in volume and  selling  prices of the  BioArchive  product
line,  reduction of our in-house  costs of  manufacturing,  and an array of cost
reduction activities to improve our operating margin."

The Company  reported a cash  balance of $16.6  million  and working  capital of
$19.8  million  at June 30,  2004  compared  to $6.8  million  of cash and $10.4
million of working capital at June 30, 2003.

"I am  very  pleased  with  our  results  for  fiscal  2004,  specifically,  our
achievement  of  record   revenues  and  gross  profit,   and  a   significantly
strengthened   balance  sheet",   said  Philip  Coelho,   Chairman  and  CEO  of
ThermoGenesis.  "It appears that our  BioArchive  product  platform is achieving
international  market  acceptance  and we hope the same  trend  will  follow the
completion  of the  CryoSeal  US  clinical  trial and  market  launch of product
platform extensions."
