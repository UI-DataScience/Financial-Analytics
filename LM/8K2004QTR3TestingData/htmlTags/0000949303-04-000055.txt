Cognigen Networks, Inc. Reports FY 2004 Financial Results:
Cash Flows from Operations Double Over Previous Year As Expenses Are Reduced

Mountlake Terrace, Washington,  September 21 /PRNewswire-First Call/ -- Cognigen
Networks,  Inc.  (OTC  Bulletin  Board:  CGNW-  news),  the  Seattle  area based
Internet-enabled  marketer of communications services and certificated reseller,
today announced the audited financial results for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2004.  In its  annual  report  on Form  10-KSB  that it will  file with the SEC,
Cognigen will report annual revenue of $10,735,099,  a decrease of 1.7% compared
to FY 2003, when the Company  realized  revenue of $10,916,272.  Cash flows from
operations for fiscal 2004 were $227,938,  compared to $113,085 for fiscal 2003.
The Company  recorded a loss in income from operations of ($2,878,638) or a loss
of approximately  $.32 per share due primarily to a one-time non-cash  write-off
of goodwill  associated with the sale of its wholly owned  subsidiary,  Cognigen
Switching  Technologies,  and a  one-time  charge  of  $494,149  related  to the
termination  of its  InTandem  Funding  Agreement.  Complete  details  of  these
transactions  and full  financial  data will be able to be  obtained  from Edgar
Online and other similar sources in the Form 10-KSB report.

Cognigen's  president  and CEO,  Thomas S. Smith,  commented,  "Fiscal Year 2004
brought  significant  changes in the Company's  corporate  structure.  First, we
concluded  the  sale  of  Cognigen  Switching  Technologies  as  part  of a cost
containment  strategy  that is  producing  savings of  approximately  $25,000 to
$30,000 per month while  maintaining the delivery of services at presale levels.
Second,  we concluded the funding  agreement  with InTandem that resulted in our
acquisition of that company while containing our future funding obligations.  As
a further  reflection of Cognigen's  program to transition from vendor agency to
reseller status,  telecommunication revenue increased $1,647,948 or 41% over the
previous fiscal year while marketing commissions revenue decreased by $1,837,829
or 27% less than in FY 2003..  While the overall  lack of revenue  growth is not
acceptable,  it does reflect general  conditions  within our sector of marketing
telecommunication  services.  To  counteract  this trend,  Cognigen has moved to
expand its proprietary  customer base.  Success in this endeavor can be measured
by the 136% increase in the number of proprietary  customers  Cognigen gained in
fiscal year 2004.  The number of proprietary  customers grew from  approximately
11,000 in FY 2003 to 26,000 as of June 30, 2004."

Mr. Smith, concluded,  "Cognigen's selling,  general and administrative expenses
for FY 2004  decreased by $124,094  compared to FY 2003, a 3%  reduction."  This
trend  is  expected  to  continue  with  the  cost  and  expense  reductions  of
approximately  $20,000 per month over and above the $25,000 to $30,000 per month
created by the sale of Cognigen Switching Technologies."
