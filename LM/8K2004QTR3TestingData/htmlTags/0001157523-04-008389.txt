  American Technical Ceramics Corp. Announces Fourth Quarter Financial Results

    HUNTINGTON STATION, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 9, 2004--American
Technical Ceramics Corp. (AMEX Symbol: AMK), a leading manufacturer of
high-performance electronic components, including capacitors and thin
film circuits for a broad range of commercial and military
applications, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter
and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.
    Net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 increased 45% to
$19,009,000 from $13,070,000 in the comparable quarter in fiscal year
2003. Net income amounted to $3,090,000, or approximately $0.38 per
common share and $0.36 per common share assuming dilution, for the
quarter ended June 30, 2004, compared with a net loss of $210,000, or
approximately ($0.03) per common share and common share assuming
dilution, for the comparable quarter ended June 30, 2003.
    Net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 increased 25% to
$61,183,000 from $49,048,000 in fiscal year 2003. Net income amounted
to $2,176,000, or approximately $0.27 per common share and $0.25 per
common share assuming dilution, for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2004, compared with a net loss of $501,000, or approximately ($0.06)
per common share and common share assuming dilution, for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2003.
    Management stated that the significant improvement in sales was
due to both improved business conditions and increased market share
across all product lines and in all of the markets the Company serves,
particularly the wireless infrastructure and semiconductor equipment
markets. The wireless infrastructure market traditionally has been the
Company's largest market. Profit improvements were also driven by
gross profit margin increases which resulted primarily from the
ability to run production at higher more efficient volumes, in part
due to the reengineering efforts previously implemented by the
Company, and comparatively lower inventory reserve requirements as a
result of the significant increase in bookings.
    Bookings for the fourth quarter increased to $20,336,000, an
increase of 9% over the immediately preceding quarter, and an increase
of 77% over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year.
Bookings for the full year increased 34% over the prior fiscal year.
Improvement was evident in most of the Company's major product lines
and markets, particularly in the wireless infrastructure and
semiconductor equipment markets.
    Victor Insetta, President and Chief Executive Officer of the
Company, stated, "We are very pleased with the results for the quarter
and the full year. Our program of investments has improved our
customer service and product delivery capabilities. This, in turn, has
enabled us to meet our customers' requirements as demand in our core
markets surged."
    Mr. Insetta added, "Bookings have increased in each of the last
four quarters over the sequential quarter. When periods of rapid
growth follow an extended downturn, customers tend to balance their
inventories and production lines. While we expect that this will
result in lower bookings and net sales in the first quarter compared
to last quarter which, in turn, will diminish our first quarter's
results, we also expect our first quarter's bookings and net sales to
be up substantially compared to the comparable quarter in the prior
fiscal year. We foresee improvements in bookings and sales as the year
progresses. In short, we believe fiscal year 2005 will be a good year
for ATC."
