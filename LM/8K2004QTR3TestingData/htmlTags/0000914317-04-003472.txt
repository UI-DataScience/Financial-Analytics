ITEM 2.01 COMPLETION OF ACQUISTION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On September 10, 2004, Capital Bank Corporation consummated the previously
announced sale of three branches in Woodland, Warrenton and Seaboard, NC to
other financial institutions. The transaction included the sale of approximately
$13 million in loans and the assumption of approximately $40 million in
deposits. In order to fund the assumption of the net liabilities, the Company
initially borrowed approximately $4 million under its existing line of credit
with the Federal Home Loan Bank and will borrow an addition $3 - 4 million for
the final settlement within the next 60 days. The Company received a net deposit
premium of approximately $2.8 million as a result of the transaction and will
write-off intangibles associated with these branches of approximately $1.2
million. Net of transaction and other disposal costs associated with the sale,
the Company anticipates a pre-tax one time gain on the transaction in excess of
$1 million which will be recorded in the third quarter.
