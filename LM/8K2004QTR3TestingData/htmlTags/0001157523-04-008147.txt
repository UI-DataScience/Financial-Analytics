Catalyst Semiconductor Reports 1st Quarter Results

    SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 26, 2004--Catalyst
Semiconductor, Inc. (Nasdaq:CATS), a developer and marketer of
programmable and analog mixed signal products used in
telecommunications, networking systems, computation, automotive,
industrial and consumer markets, today reported financial results for
its fiscal first quarter ended July 31, 2004.
    For the fiscal first quarter ended July 31, 2004, Catalyst had net
income of $2.2 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, on revenues of
$16.7 million. This compares with net income of $920,000, or $0.05 per
diluted share, on revenues of $13.8 million in the quarter ended July
31, 2003. In the quarter ended April 30, 2004, Catalyst reported net
income of $5.6 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, on revenues of
$16.8 million.
    Revenues from analog/mixed signal products were $766,000, or 4.6%
of revenues, in the quarter ended July 31, 2004, compared with
$277,000, or 2.0% of revenues, in the quarter ended July 31, 2003 and
$490,000, or 2.9% of revenues, in the quarter ended April 30, 2004.
    Gross margin for the quarter ended July 31, 2004 was 51.9%,
compared to 37.2% for the quarter ended July 31, 2003 and 49.0% for
the quarter ended April 30, 2004. First quarter sales reflected a
better mix of new products and included increased sales of less
expensive inventory purchased in previous quarters.
    Catalyst recorded tax expense of $1.3 million, or 37% of net
income before taxes during the quarter ended July 31, 2004. This
compares to an income tax expense of $162,000 in the quarter ended
July 31, 2003 and a tax benefit of $2.2 million in the quarter ended
April 30, 2004.
    Research & Development and Sales, General and Administrative
expenses increased 38% and 21%, respectively, from the quarter ended
July 31, 2003. Research & Development and Sales, General and
Administrative expenses both increased 7% from the quarter ended April
30, 2004, reflecting increased efforts to develop and promote emerging
analog/mixed signal products.
    As of July 31, 2004, Catalyst had cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments of $45.8 million, an increase of $12.0 million
compared to the previous quarter as $8.0 million of cash was raised in
a secondary common stock offering. Additionally, the company received
$369,000 from stock option exercises and $3.6 million was generated by
operations.
    Catalyst also announced today that its Board of Directors
authorized the repurchase in open market transactions from time to
time of an additional 1,000,000 shares, or an aggregate of 3,000,000
shares. To date, Catalyst has repurchased approximately 1.5 million
shares under this program.

    Management Comments & Outlook

    "Our efforts to target higher margin sales opportunities have
resulted in a near record quarterly gross margin of 51.9%. Also
contributing to this was the lower cost inventories that we had
acquired earlier and an increase in revenues from our analog/mixed
signal products. It is encouraging to see the progress being made in
growing the revenues from our analog/mixed signal products but this
product line is still emerging and is subject to quarterly variations
in its growth rate," said Gelu Voicu, president and chief executive
officer. "Nevertheless, as fab capacities have tightened we expect
gross margins to be under pressure."
