                Crossroads Systems Reports Third Quarter Results

     AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 2, 2004--Crossroads Systems, Inc.
(NASDAQ:CRDS), a leading provider of connectivity for storage networking
solutions, today reported results for its fiscal third quarter ended July 31,
2004 (Q3'04).
     Revenue totaled $4.9M for Q3'04 compared to $7.4M in the fiscal second
quarter ended April 30, 2004 (Q2'04). The factors affecting the decrease in
revenue included seasonality and weakness in sales across the OEM business.
Gross margin percentage was 72% for Q3'04, compared to 70% for Q2'04. Net loss
for Q3'04 was $2.1M or $0.08 per share compared to $732,000 net loss, or $0.03
per share in Q2'04.
     In December 2003, Crossroads entered into a strategic relationship with
NexQL Corporation, a development stage company, for the joint development of
advanced data management solutions. The consolidation of NexQL had a direct
impact on the Company's current net loss. Net operating expenses attributable to
NexQL for the three and nine month periods ended July 31, 2004 were
approximately $0.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively.
     "Our visibility going into the third quarter indicated seasonal weakness;
however, it was disappointing that actual sales were unable to meet even these
lowered expectations," said Rob Sims, president and chief executive officer,
Crossroads Systems. "Nevertheless, we remain confident in the long-term,
strategic direction of the Company and we continue to be focused on implementing
our new product roadmap which will deliver new solutions into emerging markets."

     Forward-Looking Statements

     This release may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The words "believe," "expect,"
"intend," "plan," "project," "will" and similar phrases as they relate to
Crossroads are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These
statements reflect the current views and assumptions of Crossroads, and are
subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially from expectations. Among the important factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking
statements are: the quarterly fluctuations of Crossroads' operating results and
Crossroads' inability to accurately predict revenue and budget for expenses for
future periods; the extent to which Crossroads will maintain positive cash flow;
the company's ability to maintain its operating margins; the acceptance by our
existing customers of any new family of products; any general economic slowdown,
including, in particular, related expense reductions by organizations affecting
their IT spending and budget which could impact sales; the dependence of
Crossroads' business on the storage area network market which is evolving and
unpredictable; the possibility that the pending shareholder class action
lawsuits could result in an adverse outcome to the company; unforeseen changes
in anticipated expenses or revenues; the continuation of Crossroads' successful
relationships with its limited number of OEM customers; Crossroads' inability to
protect its intellectual property rights, as well as, other factors detailed in
Crossroads' filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its
Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on 10-Q. Crossroads expressly
disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates or revisions to the
information contained in this press release or with respect to any future
distribution of its stock by investors, or to update or revise any
forward-looking statements to reflect any changes in expectations, or any change
in events or circumstances on which those statements are based, unless otherwise
required by law.
