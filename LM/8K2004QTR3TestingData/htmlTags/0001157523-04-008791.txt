      The Pepsi Bottling Group Reports Solid Earnings Growth in
                            Third Quarter;
               Volume Growth Achieved in All Key Markets

    SOMERS, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 28, 2004--The Pepsi Bottling
Group, Inc. (NYSE:PBG) today reported third quarter 2004 net income of
$191 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.73, which
includes a $0.02 gain from the settlement of certain international tax
audits. These results compare to reported third quarter 2003 net
income of $183 million, or EPS of $0.67. Reported year-to-date net
income was $383 million, or EPS of $1.44, which includes the $0.02 tax
gain. These results compare to reported year-to-date 2003 net income
of $353 million, or $1.26 per share, before accounting for the
cumulative effect of the adoption of a new accounting principle, which
reduced EPS by $0.02.

    --  Worldwide physical case volume grew two percent on a constant
        territory basis in the third quarter. PBG's U.S. business
        delivered one-percent volume growth and the Company's European
        business generated a five-percent increase in volume. In
        Mexico, strong marketplace execution led to a three-percent
        improvement in physical case volume.

    --  In the U.S., PBG delivered another consecutive quarter of net
        revenue per case growth, up three percent for the third
        quarter. Worldwide, net revenue per case improved two percent.

    --  Given three quarters of strong earnings performance, PBG
        adjusted its full-year earnings expectations to a range of
        $1.71 to $1.74, excluding the previously mentioned tax gain.

    "Outstanding execution in the marketplace drove our results in the
third quarter," said John T. Cahill, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of PBG. "In the U.S., we were faced with a soft retail
environment this past quarter, as well as a challenging year-over-year
volume lap. Our field organization rose to the challenge and delivered
one-percent volume improvement, with growth in both the cold drink and
take home channels of our business. Brand Mountain Dew performance was
strong, benefiting from the introduction of the latest line extension,
Mountain Dew Pitch Black, near the end of the quarter. Tropicana juice
drinks continued to perform well, achieving three points of share
since the introduction earlier this year. Our net revenue per case
results were very good, growing for the 20th consecutive quarter
excluding the impact of last year's accounting change."
    Cahill continued, "We were very pleased with our positive volume
results in Mexico. This volume improvement was consistent across our
portfolio with growth generated from our carbonated soft drinks,
bottled water and jug water. These results reflect the ongoing
progress we're making on a number of fronts. While there remains a lot
of work ahead of us in Mexico, we believe we're on the right track to
sustained improvement."
    On a constant territory basis, physical case volume worldwide grew
two percent in the third quarter. (Constant territory calculations
assume all significant acquisitions made in 2003 were made at the
beginning of 2003 and exclude all significant acquisitions made in
2004.) In the U.S., volume in PBG's cold drink business grew one
percent, while its take home volume was positive. PBG's business in
Canada also increased its volume one percent in the quarter. The
Company's businesses in Europe collectively generated five percent
growth in volume, with its Russian and Turkey territories each
delivering double-digit volume improvement. Physical case volume of
carbonated soft drinks in Mexico grew three percent for the quarter.
Sales of bottled water and jug water in Mexico also improved, up 18
and two percent respectively.
    Worldwide operating income was flat in the third quarter. This was
due primarily to rising raw materials costs and higher benefit and
compensation expenses. Year-to-date, worldwide operating income grew
four percent.
    During the third quarter of 2004, PBG repurchased 6.8 million
shares of common stock. Since the inception of the Company's share
repurchase program in October 1999, more than 80 million shares have
been repurchased.
    The Company revised upward the lower end of the range of its
estimate for full year 2004 earnings per share. The current forecast
is for EPS of $1.71 to $1.74 excluding the previously mentioned tax
gain. PBG reiterated its expectations for worldwide physical case
volume growth for the full year 2004 of two to three percent with net
revenue per case improvement of two to three percent. The Company's
operating income outlook for 2004 remains unchanged, with growth
expected to come in at the mid-single digit range. PBG expects cash
from operations less capital expenditures to be approximately $530
million, a 20 percent increase over 2003 results. The Company expects
capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $675 to $700
million.
    The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc. (www.pbg.com) is the world's
largest manufacturer, seller and distributor of Pepsi-Cola beverages
with operations in the U.S., Canada, Greece, Mexico, Russia, Spain and
Turkey.
