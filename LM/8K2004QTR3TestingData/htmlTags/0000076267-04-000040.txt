       PARK ELECTROCHEMICAL REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS

LAKE   SUCCESS,   New   York,   September   23,   2004......Park
Electrochemical Corp. (NYSE-PKE) reported sales  of  $51,098,000
for  the second quarter ended August 29, 2004 compared to  sales
from continuing operations of $43,566,000 for the second quarter
of  last  year.   Park's  sales for the first  six  months  were
$109,616,000  compared  to sales from continuing  operations  of
$87,889,000 for last year's first six months.

Park  reported net earnings of $2,947,000 for the second  quarter
ended August 29, 2004 compared to net earnings of $19,038,000 for
last  fiscal year's second quarter ended August 31, 2003.  During
the  prior year's second quarter, the Company realized a  pre-tax
gain  of  $33,088,000  related to the  payment  of  the  judgment
against  Delco Electronics Corporation resulting from the lawsuit
filed against Delco, and the Company incurred pre-tax charges  of
$6,504,000 related to the realignment of its North American  FR-4
business  operations.   As a result, net profit  from  continuing
operations  before special items for last year's  second  quarter
was $1,098,000.

For  the  six month period ended August 29, 2004, Park  reported
net   earnings  of  $8,968,000  compared  to  net  earnings   of
$10,587,000  for  last year's first six month period.   For  the
prior year's first six month period, the Company reported a pre-
tax gain of $33,088,000 related to the Delco lawsuit and pre-tax
charges of $8,438,000 related to realignment costs. As a result,
net  profit from continuing operations before special items  for
last year's first six month period was $512,000.

Park  reported  diluted  earnings per share  of  $.15  and  $.45,
respectively, for the second quarter and six months ended  August
29, 2004 compared to diluted earnings per share of $.95 and $.53,
respectively, for last year's second quarter and first six  month
period.   Diluted  earnings per share from continuing  operations
before  special items were $.06 and $.03, respectively, for  last
year's second quarter and first six month period.

Brian  Shore, Park's President and CEO, said, "When we  announced
our  first quarter results on June 30, 2004, I commented that  it
appeared  that our industry had very recently begun to slow  down
to  some extent.  With the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, it appears
that  our  observation regarding the industry's slowing down  was
correct.  As a matter of fact, throughout the second quarter, our
business  operated  at  levels below  the  levels  of  the  first
quarter.   Obviously,  the question many  of  you  will  have  is
whether  our  global industry will now begin  to  pick  back  up,
especially since the summer is over.  Unfortunately,   there  are
no  clear  signals at this time as to whether the global industry
climate  will improve during the remainder of the calendar  year.
Although  we  continue  to  grow and expand  and  invest  in  our
business  in  Asia,  we have made additional adjustments  to  our
volume  FR-4 oriented businesses, particularly in North  America.
As  I have explained in the past, although we are fully committed
to  our existing FR-4 customers in North America and Europe, I do
not believe that our volume FR-4 businesses will be the driver of
our company's future.  As a result, we continue to transition our
traditional  volume  FR-4  manufacturing  facilities  to   higher
technology  product manufacturing.  As I have also  explained  on
numerous occasions, we run our business for the long term, and we
make  adjustments to our business operations only when we believe
it  is in the long-term interest of our company to do so.  In any
case, regardless as to what business levels we see over the  next
three months or six months or twelve months, we continue the long
and   difficult  process  of  reinventing  our  company  into   a
technology  company.  We believe this reinvention of our  company
is essential for our future regardless as to what business levels
we experience over the short term."

The  Company  will  conduct  a conference  call  to  discuss  its
financial  results  at 11:00 a.m. EDT today. Forward-looking  and
other  material  information may be discussed in this  conference
call. The conference call dial-in number is (800) 289-0528.

For  those  unable to listen to the call live, a conference  call
replay  will be available from approximately 2:00 p.m. EDT  today
through  11:59  p.m.  EDT  on Monday,  September  27,  2004.  The
conference call replay can be accessed by dialing (888)  203-1112
and  entering  passcode  834034 or on the  Company's  website  at
www.parkelectro.com   under  the  caption  "Investor   Conference
Calls".

Any  additional material financial or statistical data  disclosed
in  the conference call will also be available at the time of the
conference  call on the Company's web site at www.parkelectro.com
under the caption "Investor Conference Calls".

Park believes that an evaluation of its ongoing operations would
be  difficult  if the disclosure of its financial  results  were
limited  to  generally accepted accounting  principles  ("GAAP")
financial  measures. Accordingly, in addition to disclosing  its
financial  results  determined in  accordance  with  GAAP,  Park
discloses non-GAAP operating results that exclude special  items
in  order  to  assist  its shareholders  and  other  readers  in
assessing  the  company's operating performance.  Such  non-GAAP
financial  measures  are  provided  to  supplement  the  results
provided in accordance with GAAP.

Certain  portions  of  this  press  release  may  be  deemed  to
constitute  forward  looking  statements  that  are  subject  to
various  factors  which  could cause actual  results  to  differ
materially from Park's expectations.  Such factors include,  but
are  not  limited  to,  general conditions  in  the  electronics
industry,  Park's  competitive position, the  status  of  Park's
relationships   with  its  customers,  economic  conditions   in
international  markets, the cost and availability of  utilities,
and  the  various  factors set forth under the caption  "Factors
That  May  Affect Future Results" after Item 7 of Park's  Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2004.
