FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

            COVISTA COMMUNICATIONS, INC. ANNOUNCES OPERATING RESULTS
                 FOR QUARTER AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2004

CHATTANOOGA, TN - September 9, 2004 - Covista Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ
symbol: CVST) today announced operating results for the three and six-month
periods ended July 31, 2004.

For the three months ended July 31, 2004, the Company reported a loss of
$1,150,000 or $0.06 a share on revenues of $18,355,000 as compared with a loss
of $885,000 or $0.05 per share on revenues of $21,457,000 for the prior year's
fiscal period. The Company reported a loss of $3,150,000 or $0.18 per share on
revenues of $36,549,000 for the six months ended July 31, 2004, as compared with
a loss of $1,663,000 or $0.09 per share on revenues of $44,727,000 for the
comparable period in the prior fiscal year.

The overall revenue decrease is primarily related to a decline in the retail
commercial segment, partially offset by moderate growth in the KISS residential
segment.

The Company has previously announced that, subsequent to July 31, 2004, it had
successfully closed a transaction where it sold the majority of its retail
commercial customer base and selected assets to PAETEC Communications for cash.

The moderate growth in the KISS segment is primarily attributed to the marketing
of local service to residential users in selected markets. While the Company has
launched local services to the KISS residential segment in certain markets, it
plans to expand the number of markets in which it intends to offer its local and
long distance bundled product offering.

John Leach, Jr., Covista's President and Chief Executive Officer, stated,
"Closing the transaction with PAETEC provides us with significant advantages as
we seek to navigate through pending uncertain regulatory waters. The transaction
not only strengthens our working capital position, but also enables us to
improve our geographic focus related to target customers as well as the
infrastructure and costs related to our switching network and back office
customer support requirements."

We are providing the following consolidated summary of operations (unaudited)
for the three and six- month periods ended July 31, 2004 and 2003 (amounts and
number of shares in thousands except for per share data):
