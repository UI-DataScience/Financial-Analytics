   Qualstar Reports Fiscal 2004 Fourth Quarter and Year-End Results

    SIMI VALLEY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 24, 2004--Qualstar(R)
Corporation (Nasdaq:QBAK), a manufacturer of automated tape storage
solutions, today reported financial results for the fourth fiscal
quarter and year ended June 30, 2004.

    Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2004 Financial Results

    Revenues for the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter were $7.7 million,
versus $8.2 million for the same quarter of the prior year. The
decrease in revenues can be primarily attributed to a decline in AIT-
and SDLT-based library revenue and the lack of 9-track tape drive
revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, partially offset by
higher revenue from tape libraries incorporating LTO and SAIT tape
drives. Gross margin in the 2004 fourth quarter rose to 40.5 percent,
compared to 36.2 percent reported in the year-ago quarter. The
increase in gross margin was principally due to a favorable book to
physical inventory adjustment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.
    Research and development costs for the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004 were $977,000, or 12.7 percent of revenues, compared to $1.1
million, or 13.3 percent of revenues, for the year-ago quarter. Sales
and marketing expenses for the 2004 fiscal fourth quarter were
$958,000, or 12.4 percent of revenues, compared to $1.0 million, or
12.3 percent of revenues, in the same quarter last year. General and
administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 were
$937,000, or 12.2 percent of revenues, versus $1.3 million, or 16.5
percent of revenues, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. In the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, Qualstar did not incur any costs
associated with its previous patent infringement dispute with Raytheon
Company, resulting in a significant reduction in general and
administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 compared
to the year-ago period. The dispute with Raytheon was settled in April
2004.
    The Company recorded a tax provision of approximately $234,000 in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, resulting in an effective tax
benefit rate of 16.6% for the full fiscal year 2004, compared to an
effective tax rate of 33.3% for fiscal 2003. The low effective tax
benefit rate in fiscal 2004 can be primarily attributed to valuation
allowances established for capital losses realized on a tax basis in
fiscal 2004.
    Qualstar reported income from operations of $242,000 for the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to a loss from operations of
$486,000 for last year's fourth quarter. Further, the Company reported
a net loss of $16,000, or breakeven per diluted share, for the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004, compared with a net loss of $43,000, or
breakeven per diluted share, for last year's fourth quarter.
    Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $35.8
million at June 30, 2004, compared with $36.1 million at June 30,
2003. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) were approximately 55 days at June
30, 2004, compared to approximately 50 days at June 30, 2003.
Inventory turns were 2.5 times on an annualized basis for the period
ended June 30, 2004, compared to 2.9 times on an annualized basis for
the period ended June 30, 2003.

    Full Year 2004 Results

    Qualstar's fiscal 2004 revenues were $31.5 million, compared to
$33.6 million for fiscal 2003. The Company reported a net loss of
$731,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, in fiscal 2004, compared with
net income of $549,000, or $0.04 per diluted share, for fiscal 2003.
    "Our fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations,"
said Bill Gervais, president and chief executive officer of Qualstar
Corporation. "With a highly regarded and feature-rich suite of storage
solutions already on the market, and a line of next-generation
products currently under development, we are enhancing our sales and
marketing model to build out our customer base. We believe our recent
distribution agreement with Ingram Micro should help enhance our
presence in the marketplace.
    "We remain on track to announce our new XLS product family in late
calendar 2004, with customer shipments expected in the first half of
calendar 2005. By entering the high-end enterprise-class tape storage
market with a product that meets stringent customer requirements at an
attractive price point, we will gain access to a new, significant
market opportunity," continued Mr. Gervais.
    "As we continue our sales and development efforts, we're focused
on solidifying our position as the industry's recognized reliability
leader. We believe this is the right strategy to help drive Qualstar
to future long-term success."
