FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

               KELLWOOD (NYSE:KWD) REPORTS SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
                SALES UP 10 PERCENT - NET EARNINGS UP 30 PERCENT
                       REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND DECLARED

ST. LOUIS, MO., August 26, 2004 - Kellwood Company reported operating results
for the second quarter ended July 31, 2004, according to Hal J. Upbin, chairman
and chief executive officer.

         Sales for the second quarter increased $51 million, or 10 percent to
$560 million, versus $509 million last year due to a combination of organic
growth of $34 million, or 7 percent, and the acquisition of Phat Fashions and
Phat Farm which provided $17 million of revenue. Phat Fashions and Phat Farm
were acquired on February 3, 2004, and are being reported within the Men's
Sportswear segment.

         The organic growth was driven by the new marketing initiatives put in
place during the last nine months of fiscal year 2003 including Calvin Klein(R),
IZOD(R), XOXO(R) and Lucy PeredaTM women's sportswear, Liz Claiborne(R) Dresses
and Suits, and Def Jam UniversityTM urban sportswear which collectively provided
$43 million of growth in the second quarter. This growth was partially offset by
the planned elimination of certain low margin programs, which reduced sales by
$15 million. Sales growth of the remaining businesses in the second quarter was
$6 million, or 1 percent.

         The year-to-year organic sales growth for the quarter came from the
Women's Sportswear segment, up 10 percent, and the Men's Sportswear segment, up
13 percent. These increases were partially offset by an 8 percent drop in sales
of Other Soft Goods.

         Net earnings in the second quarter from continuing operations were
strong, increasing $2.3 million, or 30 percent, to $10.2 million, or $0.36 per
diluted share, versus $7.9 million, or $0.29 per share last year. The increase
in earnings was driven by increased sales, a 1.5 percentage point increase in
gross profit as a percent of sales partially offset by higher SG&A spending
attendant with the new marketing initiatives and SG&A expense from the
acquisition of Phat Fashions and Phat Farm. This is the ninth consecutive
quarter in which Kellwood has reported a significant year-to-year improvement in
gross profit as a percent of sales reflecting the continued underlying strength
of operations, improved sourcing, quality of inventory and improving mix of
business.

         Kellwood ended the quarter with an exceptionally strong balance sheet
with ample liquidity to fund acquisitions to enhance its diversification and
capability to service the needs of the Company's customers.

ADD ONE

         Total inventory at the end of the second quarter including inventory
from the acquisition increased by only $4 million versus prior year and
represented 57 days supply, versus 62 days at the end of the second quarter last
year.

         Sales for the first six months grew by $66 million, or 6 percent to
$1.247 billion, versus $1.181 billion last year. The increase came from organic
growth of $39 million, or 3 percent and $27 from the acquisition of Phat
Fashions and Phat Farm made earlier this year. The increase in organic sales for
the first half came from an 8 percent increase in Women's Sportswear and a 7
percent increase in Men's Sportswear, partially offset by a 13 percent drop in
sales of Other Soft Goods.

         Net earnings from continuing operations for the first six months
increased $6.3 million, or 22 percent, to $35.3 million, or $1.26 per share on a
diluted basis, versus $29.0 million, or $1.08 per share last year. The strong
growth in net earnings for the first half was driven by higher sales and by a
1.9 percentage point year-to-year improvement in gross profit. Kellwood's
investment in launching several new brands and the acquisition of Phat Fashions
and Phat Farm has resulted in higher SG&A spending. These initiatives are
expected to generate an accelerating rate of growth in sales and operating
earnings during the second half of the year.

         "As Kellwood looks ahead to the third quarter and total year, we remain
optimistic that the economy, the rate of job creation, and consumer confidence
and spending on apparel will continue to improve albeit at a slower pace than
experienced earlier this year. We see this same sense of guarded optimism
expressed by our customers as they book orders for Fall and Holiday. Like our
customers, Kellwood would rather focus on gross margin and inventory turnover
than get too far ahead of a cautious consumer with orders and inventory.

         "As a result of the recent softening in consumer demand for apparel, as
indicated by Fall orders from customers and some delays in launching certain new
marketing initiatives from the third to the fourth quarter, we expect sales in
the third quarter to increase by 12 to 13 percent and be in the range of
$720-$730 million versus $644 million last year, "said Upbin.

         Net earnings from continuing operations are forecasted to increase by
approximately 5 percent and be in the range of $32.5 million, or $1.15 per
diluted share, versus $30.9 million, or $1.13 per share reported last year.

         The Company expects to be on target with its financial plan for the
fiscal year which calls for sales to increase by 11 percent to approximately
$2.6 billion, versus $2.35 billion last year. Net earnings from continuing
operations for the year are planned to increase by $16-$18 million, or
approximately 24 percent to $89-$91 million, or $3.15-$3.25 per diluted share,
versus $72.6 million, or $2.68 per share reported last year.

NOTE REGARDING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
(AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)

On October 30, 2003, the Company finalized an agreement to sell their domestic
and European hosiery (Hosiery) operations for $7,500 plus reimbursement of
$2,800 for costs incurred by the Company in connection with the closure of
certain facilities. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company
decided to discontinue their True Beauty by Emme(R) (True Beauty) operations.
This included the termination of the related license agreement before its
expiration. The operations of True Beauty ceased in the fourth quarter of 2003.
Accordingly, both the Hosiery and True Beauty businesses have been accounted for
as discontinued operations. As such, their operating results and assets and
liabilities are segregated in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement
of earnings and condensed consolidated balance sheet. Prior to being classified
as discontinued, the Hosiery operations were included in the Men's Sportswear
segment, and True Beauty was included in the Women's Sportswear segment.

For the three and six months ended July 31, 2004, there was no operating
activity for the discontinued operations. For the three and six months ended
August 2, 2003, the operating results for the discontinued Hosiery and True
Beauty businesses are as follows:
