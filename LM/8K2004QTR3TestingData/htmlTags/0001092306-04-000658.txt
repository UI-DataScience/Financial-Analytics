           THE CHALONE WINE GROUP REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2004 RESULTS

Napa,  California,  August 12, 2004 --- The Chalone  Wine Group,  Ltd.  (Nasdaq:
CHLN)  announced  today it had a net  revenue of  $30,573,000  and net income of
$58,000  during  the  first six  months of 2004  compared  to a net  revenue  of
$29,012,000 and a net income of $504,000 in the same period of 2003.

"This quarter we have already begun to see the positive effects of our three new
wineries on our bottom line," said President and CEO Tom Selfridge. "The current
releases of Provenance  Vineyards are selling well in the marketplace;  in April
we had the debut of the Orogeny Vineyards Pinot Noir from Russian River Valley's
Green Valley and in May we celebrated the inaugural release of Hewitt Vineyard's
estate Cabernet Sauvignon from the Rutherford Bench.  Thanks to these new wines,
plus our efforts with our other wineries,  we had an increase in net revenues of
$1,561,000 in the first six months of 2004,  compared to that same time frame in
2003."

Commenting  on the  results  for the first  half of 2004,  Selfridge  said,  "As
previously announced, on May 17th we received a proposal from Domaines Barons de
Rothschild  (Lafite)  SCA  (DBR) to  purchase  the  company.  We have  formed an
independent  special  committee  of the board of the  directors  to evaluate the
proposal,  and the  committee  has  retained  outside  attorneys  and  financial
advisors to assist its evaluation of the DBR proposal.  If we subtract the costs
associated  with the special  committee  and other efforts  associated  with the
proposal, we would have posted a higher profit of $370,000 for the first half of
2004."

Selfridge  added,  "The proposed  purchase is just that - a proposal.  This will
take some time to sort out and, in the meantime, all of the employees at Chalone
Wine Group are focusing on producing and selling  great wine.  During these very
competitive  times in the marketplace,  we are continuing to keep our eye on the
ball."

measure.  The profit of $370,000  noted above is a non-GAAP,  pro forma  measure
