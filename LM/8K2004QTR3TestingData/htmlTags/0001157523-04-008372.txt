     SigmaTron International, Inc. Reports First Fiscal Quarter 2005 Results

    ELK GROVE VILLAGE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 9, 2004--SigmaTron
International, Inc. (Nasdaq:SGMA) today reported revenues and earnings
for the quarter ended July 31, 2004. Revenues were $25,078,167
resulting in a 1% increase from the prior year first quarter revenues
of $24,833,796. Net profit decreased 18% for the first quarter of
fiscal 2005 to $1,036,969 compared to $1,269,979 for fiscal 2004.
Fully diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2005
were $ 0.27 compared to $0.37 in the prior year.
    Gary R. Fairhead, SigmaTron's President and Chief Executive
Officer, commented: "We are pleased to report a profitable first
quarter for fiscal 2005. While our profits are down from the first
quarter of fiscal 2004, which was a record for the first quarter, our
results in the short term will be negatively impacted by our
investment in China. If you add to that planned expense the escalating
insurance costs and regulatory costs imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley, we
believe we have held our own reasonably well.
    "During the quarter our production continued to slowly ramp up in
China. As we go thru fiscal 2005 we expect the revenue to continue to
grow, which should put China in a positive operating position later in
fiscal 2005. The reaction to our China operation from customers and
potential customers has been favorable to date.
    "During the first quarter our Las Vegas operation was slow, which
is not atypical for the gaming market at this time of the year. We
believe that the gaming market will continue to prosper in the long
term and expect our operation in Las Vegas to benefit.
    "Our Mexican operation continues to be busy. We have also seen
renewed interest in Mexico as opposed to China which we believe will
help us long term. Elk Grove Village remains busy as well and is
looking at several new niche markets as new opportunities. As we have
already announced, during the second quarter we acquired the balance
of our affiliate, SMT Unlimited L.P. We believe this acquisition will
better position us with customers and investors.
    "We will be launching our first significant advertising campaign
in September, which is exciting. We are working with several new
customers that we believe will help us grow during calendar 2005. We
remain optimistic about the future and our opportunities and as
always, appreciate the support we receive from our stockholders,
customers, banks, vendors and employees."
