RF MICRO DEVICES UPDATES SECOND QUARTER BUSINESS OUTLOOK

Conference Call Scheduled for September 21, 2004 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern
Time

GREENSBORO, NC, September 21, 2004 - RF Micro Devices, Inc. (Nasdaq:
RFMD), a leading provider of proprietary radio frequency integrated
circuits (RFICs) for wireless communications applications, announced
today that it will host a conference call on September 21 at 9:00 a.m.
Eastern time to discuss updated financial guidance for its fiscal 2005
second quarter, which ends September 30, 2004.  The call will be
conducted by Bob Bruggeworth, president and CEO of RF Micro Devices,
and Dean Priddy, CFO of RF Micro Devices.

RF Micro Devices currently expects September 2004 quarterly revenue to
decline sequentially from the quarter ended June 30, 2004 by
approximately eight to twelve percent, which equates to quarterly
revenue of approximately $146 million to $152.5 million.  The Company's
revised revenue expectations are due primarily to lower than
anticipated sales to certain Asian handset customers, which the Company
believes was caused by excess inventory levels in the supply chain.
The Company had previously forecast quarterly revenue of approximately
$166 million in its July 20, 2004 earnings release and conference call.

RF Micro Devices currently anticipates second quarter GAAP earnings per
share in the range of ($0.03) to ($0.05) and pro forma earnings per
share in the range of ($0.01) to ($0.03).  The pro forma earnings per
share estimates exclude approximately $3.9 million in non-cash expenses
related to the Company's recent convertible bond redemption and the
amortization of deferred compensation and intangible assets. The
Company previously projected second quarter GAAP earnings per share in
the range of $0.01 to $0.02 and pro forma earnings per share in the
range of $0.03 to $0.04.

The Company currently anticipates sequential revenue growth in the
December quarter, driven by all three business units-Cellular, Wireless
Connectivity and Infrastructure.

Bob Bruggeworth commented, "The impact of short-term inventory
adjustments, primarily in Asia, clearly impacted our GSM power
amplifier business in the September quarter.  During the quarter, we
were able to partially offset this weakness by growing our
GSM/GPRS/EDGE market share at the world's two largest handset original
equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

"We are pleased with our efforts in the September quarter to grow our
emerging businesses.  During the quarter, we executed on numerous
initiatives that were part of our original July 20, 2004 guidance: We
are on track to increase our Bluetooth-Registered Trademark- business
more than two-hundred percent.  Additionally, we began production
shipments of GSM/GPRS/EDGE transceivers and power amplifiers to a top-
tier handset OEM.  We continue to forecast shipments of at least one
million POLARIS-Trademark- chipsets in the December quarter, driven
primarily by worldwide carriers' rapid migration to EDGE networks."

A live audio webcast of the presentation will be available via the
RFMD-Registered Trademark- Investor Relations web page at the following

The webcast will be available for replay until 5:00 p.m. Eastern time
on October 20, 2004.

RF Micro Devices believes pro forma reporting provides useful
supplemental information to the investment community and facilitates a
better understanding of its results of operations.  RF Micro Devices
has chosen to provide this supplemental information to investors to
enable them to perform additional comparisons of operating results and
as a means to analyze its financial performance without the impact of
certain non-cash expenses or unusual items that may obscure trends in
the Company's underlying performance.  These disclosures should not be
viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance
with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance
measures that may be presented by other companies.

RF Micro Devices, Inc., an ISO 9001- and ISO 14001-certified
manufacturer, designs, develops, manufactures and markets proprietary
radio frequency integrated circuits (RFICs) for wireless communications
products and applications. The Company is a leading supplier of power
amplifiers, one of the most critical radio frequency (RF) components in
cellular phones.  The Company is also the leading manufacturer of GaAs
HBT, which offers distinct advantages over other technologies for the
manufacture of current- and next-generation power amplifiers.  The
Company's products are included primarily in cellular phones, base
stations, wireless local area networks (WLANs), cable television modems
and global positioning systems (GPS).  The Company derives revenue from
the sale of standard and custom-designed products.  The Company offers
a broad array of products including amplifiers, mixers,
modulators/demodulators and single-chip transmitters, Bluetooth-
Registered Trademark- products and receivers and transceivers that
