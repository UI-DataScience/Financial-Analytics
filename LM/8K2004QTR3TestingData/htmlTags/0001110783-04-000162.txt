<H1 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=3>ITEM 2.02. Results of
Operations and Financial Condition. </FONT></H1>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
September 9, 2004, Monsanto Company issued a press release announcing that it increased
its estimates for the Company&#146;s fiscal year 2004 free cash flow guidance and
reaffirmed earnings per share (&#147;EPS&#148;) on an on-going business basis. This press
release is furnished as Exhibit 99 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
press release furnished herewith uses the non-GAAP financial measures of &#147;free cash
flow&#148; and EPS excluding the effect of certain items. We define &#147;free cash
flow&#148; as the total of cash flows from operating activities and cash flows from
investing activities. We believe that free cash flow is useful to investors and management
as an indication of the ability of our business to generate cash. This cash can be used to
meet business needs and obligations, reinvested into the company for future growth, or
returned to our shareowners through dividend payments or share repurchases. Free cash flow
is also used by management as one of the performance measures in determining incentive
compensation. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
non-GAAP EPS financial measure may exclude the impact of restructuring charges, charges
associated with the settlement of litigation, gains and losses on the sale of assets, and
certain other items. The specific items that are excluded from, and result in, our
non-GAAP EPS financial measure are clearly identified as such in the press release. We
believe that our non-GAAP EPS financial measure presented with these adjustments best
reflect our ongoing performance and business operations during the periods presented and
are more useful to investors for comparative purposes. In addition, management uses the
non-GAAP EPS financial measure as a guide in its budgeting and long-range planning
processes, and as a guide in determining incentive compensation. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
presentation of free cash flow and EPS excluding the effect of certain items is intended
to supplement investors&#146; understanding of our operating performance. These non-GAAP
financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
Furthermore, these non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace net income
(loss), cash flows, financial position, or comprehensive income (loss), as determined in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. </FONT></P>

RAISES FREE CASH FLOW GUIDANCE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2004; REAFFIRMS EARNINGS-PER-SHARE GUIDANCE </FONT></H1>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para (List) Indent" FSL="Default" -->
     <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ST. LOUIS (Sept. 9, 2004) &#150; Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON) today announced that
          it is increasing estimates for the company&#146;s fiscal year 2004 free cash
          flow guidance, reflecting working capital improvements as the company has been
          implementing changes to improve its return on capital (ROC). New goals for ROC
          will be announced when the company reports fiscal-year earnings on Oct. 6. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
company now expects that free cash flow will be in excess of $900 million for the 2004
fiscal year, compared with previous guidance estimating free cash flow at the $500 million
level. The company expects net cash provided by operations to be in the range of $1.15
billion and net cash required by investing activities to be in the range of $250 million. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
company also reaffirmed fiscal-year earnings-per-share (EPS) guidance of $1.55 to $1.60 on
an ongoing business basis, excluding the effect of net restructuring charges, discontinued
operations and related restructuring actions, and the write-off of goodwill associated
with the global wheat business (estimated at $(0.36), $(0.02) and $(0.26), respectively).
On a reported basis and including the estimated restructuring charges, discontinued
operations and goodwill write-off, EPS guidance is in the range of $0.91 to $0.96 for the
year, which is higher than the company&#146;s previous guidance as result of
lower-than-anticipated restructuring charges. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Our
strong cash generation is a testament to both the performance of our business and the
value of our traits and seeds strategy,&#148; said Hugh Grant, Monsanto chairman,
president and chief executive officer. &#147;With this free cash flow growth, we&#146;re
in the position to use the cash generated strategically, with a priority on returning
value to our shareowners and creating additional growth.&#148; </FONT></P>

Non-GAAP Financial Measures </FONT></H1>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>This release uses the non-GAAP
financial measures of &#147;free cash flow&#148; and &#147;earnings per share (EPS)&#148;
excluding the effect of certain items. The company defines free cash flow as the total of
cash flows from operating activities and cash flows from investing activities. A non-GAAP
EPS financial measure (which the company sometimes refers to as EPS from ongoing business)
may exclude the impact of restructuring charges, charges associated with the settlement of
litigation, gains and losses on the sale of assets, and certain other items. The specific
items that are excluded from, and result in, the company&#146;s non-GAAP EPS financial
measure are clearly identified as such in this release. The disclosure of free cash flow
and EPS excluding the effect of certain items is intended to supplement investors&#146;
understanding of the company&#146;s operating performance. These non-GAAP financial
measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Furthermore,
these non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace net income (loss), cash
flows, financial position, or comprehensive income (loss), as determined in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The non-GAAP financial
measures used in this release are reconciled to the most directly comparable financial
measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP below. </FONT></P>
