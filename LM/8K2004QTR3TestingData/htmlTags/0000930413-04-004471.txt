                    SCHOLASTIC REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS

                  STRONG PERFORMANCE IN EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING
                   DRIVES SMALLER THAN EXPECTED SEASONAL LOSS

NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 21, 2004 -- Scholastic Corporation (NASDAQ: SCHL) today
announced results for the first fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2004.
Scholastic's first quarter is its smallest revenue period, as most schools are
not in session, resulting in a seasonal loss. Last year's first quarter loss was
unusually low due to the benefit of approximately $170 million in revenues
related to the release of the record-setting best seller, HARRY POTTER AND THE
ORDER OF THE PHOENIX.

Net loss for the quarter ended August 31, 2004 was $50.3 million, or $1.27 per
share, which included $3.6 million pre-tax, or $0.06 per diluted share, in
severance costs relating to the previously announced fiscal 2004 reorganization
of the Continuities business. This compares to the year-ago net loss of $24.8
million, or $0.63 per share, which included Special severance charges of $2.0
million pre-tax, or $0.03 per diluted share. Revenues were $323.7 million in the
quarter, as compared to $475.4 million in the year-ago quarter.

"We are off to a good start to achieve Scholastic's fiscal 2005 financial
goals," said Richard Robinson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
"Strong performance in Educational Publishing, driven by technology sales, and
improved results in International helped us achieve a smaller than expected loss
for the first quarter. Our Continuities business met expectations as we
successfully executed on our plan. Non-HARRY POTTER trade revenue resumed
growth, reflecting improved sales of front-list titles. Cash use was
approximately flat with the year-ago quarter, and debt at August 31st was down
$82 million versus last year."

Scholastic's fiscal 2005 goals include revenue of $2.1 to $2.2 billion, earnings
per diluted share of $1.50 to $1.70, excluding severance charges, and free cash
flow of $40 to $50 million.

FIRST QUARTER SEGMENT ANALYSIS

CHILDREN'S BOOK PUBLISHING & DISTRIBUTION - Segment revenue was $121.8 million,
as compared to $287.9 million in the year-ago quarter, and operating loss was
$65.0 million, as compared to $16.6 million. Trade revenue declined in
comparison to the year-ago period, due to last year's release of HARRY POTTER
AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, partially offset by an 8% increase in other trade
revenues in the fiscal 2005 first quarter. As planned, Continuities results
improved on lower revenue as a result of reduced bad debt and fewer returns.

EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING - Segment revenue was $118.2 million, as compared to
$105.8 million in the year-ago quarter, and operating income was $22.2 million,
as compared to $15.5 million. A more than 50% increase in sales of the READ
180(R) technology program fueled a 25% increase in Curriculum revenue compared
to the year ago quarter. Library Publishing results improved, with revenue up
18%, while sales of collections of children's books to schools declined
modestly.

<PAGE>


INTERNATIONAL - Segment revenue was $71.8 million, as compared to $65.3 million
in the year-ago quarter, and the operating loss was $3.0 million, as compared to
$3.9 million. Segment results reflected improved revenues and profits in the
Company's Australian operations. Revenue also benefited from $4 million in
foreign currency translation.

MEDIA, LICENSING & ADVERTISING - Segment revenue was $11.9 million, as compared
to $16.4 million in the year-ago quarter, and operating loss was $6.7 million,
as compared to $4.9 million. The revenue decline primarily reflects different
production delivery schedules of animated television series in fiscal 2004 and
fiscal 2005. MAYA & MIGUEL(TM), Scholastic's new media, licensing and publishing
franchise, with a focus on the adventures of a Latino family, will debut on PBS
on October 11th.

 (1) Free cash flow is defined by the Company as net cash provided by operating
     activities, less spending on: property, plant and equipment;
     pre-publication and production costs; and royalty advances. The Company
     believes this measure, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is useful to
     investors as an indicator of cash flow available for debt repayment and
     other investing activities, such as acquisitions. The Company utilizes free
     cash flow as a further indicator of operating performance and for planning
     investing activities.
