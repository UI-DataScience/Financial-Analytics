       WHITEHALL JEWELLERS, INC. REPORTS SECOND QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS

         Chicago, Illinois, August 26, 2004 -- Whitehall Jewellers, Inc.
(NYSE:JWL) today reported financial results for the second quarter ended July
31, 2004.

         The Company reported total second quarter sales of $72.3 million
compared to $72.7 million for the second quarter last year. Net loss for the
second fiscal quarter of 2004 was $3.2 million compared to net loss of $2.8
million for the same period a year ago. Net loss per share of $0.23 in the
second quarter compares to net loss per share of $0.20 for the second quarter of
last year.

         As previously disclosed, the Company had recorded in the fourth quarter
of last year and the first quarter of the current fiscal year a total litigation
accrual of $8.9 million for the consolidated Capital Factors actions and related
investigations by the United States Attorney and Securities and Exchange
Commission. Since that time, the Company has engaged in additional settlement
discussions relating to these matters. In light of developments regarding the
foregoing, the Company has recorded an additional accrual in the quarter ended
July 31, 2004 in the amount of $310,000. In addition, professional fees
increased by approximately $370,000 over the second quarter last year. This
increase was incurred primarily in connection with the consolidated Capital
Factors actions and the related investigations by the United States Attorney and
Securities and Exchange Commission.

         For the six-month period ended July 31, 2004, the Company reported
sales of $145.3 million compared to $141.9 million last year. Net loss was $6.9
million versus a net loss of $5.6 million for the same period a year ago. Net
loss per share for the six-

month period was $0.49 compared to net loss per share of $0.39 for the six-month
period last year. For this period, the litigation accruals plus the increase in
professional fees, incurred primarily in connection with the consolidated
Capital Factors actions and the related investigations by the United States
Attorney and Securities and Exchange Commission, amounted to approximately $2.9
million before income taxes.

         Hugh M. Patinkin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Led
by Debbie Nicodemus-Volker, the Company's new Executive Vice President of
Merchandise, this quarter we began a review of the Company's merchandising and
marketing positioning. As a result of this review, in July the Company began
offering price reductions on certain items that will not be part of the
Company's merchandising assortments going forward. This will be a significant
focus for the Company during its third quarter. The Company is also currently
well advanced in its planning for the Christmas season."

          Mr. Patinkin continued, "We continue to cooperate with the United
States Attorney and the Securities and Exchange Commission in their
investigations related to the Capital Factors actions."

         Today at 9:00 a.m. EDT, the Company will host a conference call to
review results for the quarter ended July 31, 2004. To participate in the call,
please dial 877-888-7019. This call will also be broadcast live on the Internet
