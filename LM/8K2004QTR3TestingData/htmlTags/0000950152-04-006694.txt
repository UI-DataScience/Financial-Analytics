FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


          LANVISION SYSTEMS REPORTS SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2004 RESULTS

Cincinnati, Ohio, September 7, 2004 --- LanVision Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: LANV)
today announced the financial results for the second quarter and first six
months ended July 31, 2004.



Revenues for the second quarter were $2,558,295 compared with $2,966,590
reported in the second quarter of last year. The operating loss for the second
quarter of fiscal 2004 was ($83,922), compared with operating income of $646,559
in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. The net loss for the quarter was
($462,328), or ($0.05) per basic and diluted common share, compared with net
earnings of $213,596, or $0.02 per basic and diluted common share in the second
quarter of fiscal 2003.

Revenues for the first six months were $5,199,850, compared with $5,586,572
reported in the first six months of last year. The operating loss for the first
six months of fiscal 2004 was ($125,639) compared with operating income of
$398,542 in the comparable prior period. The net loss for the first six months
was ($883,391), or ($0.10) per basic and diluted common share, compared with net
loss of ($462,196), or ($0.05) per basic and diluted common share in the first
six months of last year.

Second Quarter Highlights included:

              payment of the high interest rate 1998 long-term debt and the
              related accrued and unpaid interest at maturity on July 30, 2004,
              and replacement of this debt with a $3.5 million working capital
              term loan, at Prime plus 2% (6.50%) payable in annual installments
              over three years,

              the successful pilot of LanVision's codingANYware at the
              Charleston Naval Hospital, and
              FORTUNE Small Business Magazine named LanVision as one of
              America's 100 fastest-growing small companies in America in its
              fourth annual ranking.


Brian Patsy, LanVision's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Our
current quarter and first six months operations followed our traditional
cyclical pattern, with a greater portion of our annual licensing revenues
recorded in our later two quarters. The quarterly operating results reflect
primarily a decline in high margin add-on software licensing revenues to
existing customers and the delayed purchasing decisions on new customer sales,
offset to some extent with increased application-hosting revenues, when compared
to the prior comparable period. Because the size of deals and the timing of
revenue recognition on software licensing significantly affects operating
results, the comparability of operating results among fiscal quarters can be
skewed. The current sales pipeline continues to contain significant new
opportunities that we anticipate closing during the remainder of the fiscal
year. Our ASPeN(SM) application service provider (ASP) based recurring revenues
continue to grow as we expand our distribution and the direct sales of our
application-hosting services such as codingANYware(TM). Based on our current
projections for the second half of the fiscal year, we believe that net new
software revenues from the current sales pipeline and ASP hosting services
should increase. The anticipated increase in new software licensing and ASP
hosting revenues combined with lower interest as a result refinancing our debt
at a significantly more favorable rate should enable us to be profitable in the
remaining two quarters."

Regarding the current sales pipeline for the second half of the year, Mr. Patsy
further commented, "We have a robust sales pipeline of direct and indirect
opportunities that we anticipate will close in the second half of our fiscal
year, including several large government sector codingANYware remote hosting
opportunities. In addition, we will be rolling out an important new entry level
document management solution for Emergency Departments (EDView(TM)) in September
through a joint distribution arrangement with Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE:
IRM). We anticipate piloting EDView at 2 or 3 mutual customer sites soon."

Mr. Patsy continued, "As noted in our announcement of the retirement of our high
interest rate debt, based on the anticipated prime rate and outstanding loan
balance during the second half of the current fiscal year, the anticipated
interest expense will be $109,600 compared with $955,800 in the second half of
the prior fiscal year or a reduction in interest expense of $846,200, or
approximately $0.09 per share, pre tax, for the second half of the current
fiscal year. For the next fiscal year (2005), the annual interest expense is
anticipated to be approximately $148,000 compared with $908,000 anticipated for
the current fiscal-year (2004), or a reduction of approximately $760,000 in
interest expense."

Mr. Patsy Concluded, "We believe that we are on course to achieve improved
operating results in the final six months of the current fiscal year."

ABOUT LANVISION SYSTEMS

LanVision is a healthcare information technology company focused on digitally
streamlining healthcare by providing solutions that improve document-centric
information flows while complementing and enhancing existing transaction-centric
healthcare information systems. The Company's workflow and document management
solutions bridge the gap between current, inefficient paper-based processes and
transaction-based healthcare information systems by 1) electronically capturing
document-centric information from disparate sources, 2) electronically directing
that information through vital business processes, and 3) providing access to
the information for authenticated users (such as physicians, nurses,
administrative and financial personnel and payers) across the continuum of care.

The company's workflow-based products and services offer unique solutions to
specific healthcare business processes within the Medical Record life cycle and
the revenue cycle, such as remote coding, abstracting and chart completion,
remote physician order processing, pre-admission registration scanning,
insurance verification, financial screening, secondary billing services,
explanation of benefits processing and release of information processing.

LanVision's products and services also create an integrated document-centric
repository of historical health information that is complementary and can be
seamlessly "bolted on" to existing transaction-centric clinical, financial and
management information systems, allowing healthcare providers to aggressively
move toward fully Electronic Medical Record (EMR) processes while improving
service levels and convenience for all stakeholders. These integrated systems
allow providers and administrators to dramatically improve the availability of
patient information while decreasing direct costs associated with document
retrieval, work-in-process, chart completion, document retention and archiving.

LanVision's systems can be provided on a subscription basis via remote hosting
services or installed locally. LanVision provides ASPEN, ASP-based remote
hosting services to The University Hospital, a member of The Health Alliance of
Greater Cincinnati, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and Children's Medical Center
of Columbus, Ohio among others. In addition, LanVision has installed its
workflow and document management solutions at leading healthcare providers
including Stanford Hospital and Clinics, the Albert Einstein Healthcare Network,
Parkview Health System, ProMedica Health System, Inc., the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center, Medical University Hospital Authority of South
Carolina, and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
