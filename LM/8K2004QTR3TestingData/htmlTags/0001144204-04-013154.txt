               Misonix, Inc. Reports Record Revenues and Increased
                  Earnings for Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2004

FARMINGDALE,  N.Y.,  August 25,  2004  Misonix,  Inc.  (NASDAQ  NM:  MSON) today
reported  financial results for the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2004.
Highlights for the fiscal year 2004 include:

      o     Revenues  for the twelve  months ended June 30, 2004  increased  12%
            from the prior  year  driven by a 22%  increase  in  medical  device
            product revenues.
      o     Net income increased 78% to $1.7 million for the twelve months ended
            June 30, 2004 as compared to $968,000 from the same period in fiscal
            2003.
      o     The backlog of unfilled orders was $8.7 million, a 56% increase from
            that of June 30,  2003.
      o     Sales of the Sonablate 500 (SB 500) have started in Europe.
      o     The  submission of a 510k  application  to the FDA for  laparoscopic
            ablation.

Revenues for the three months  ended June 30, 2004 were $10.8  million  compared
with $10.9 million for the same period in fiscal 2003. The Company  recorded net
income for the quarter of $548,000 or $.08 per fully diluted share,  compared to
net income of  $559,000 or $.08 per fully  diluted  share for the same period in
fiscal 2003.  Medical device product  revenues  decreased 3% to $5.6 million and
laboratory and scientific  product  revenues  increased 1% to $5.2 million.  The
decrease in medical device product revenues was attributed to an 18% decrease in
diagnostic  medical device  revenues to $2.3 million  partially  offset by a 12%
increase in therapeutic medical device revenues to $3.3 million. The increase in
laboratory  and  scientific  product  revenues was mainly  attributable  to a 6%
increase  in sales of  endoscopic  cleaning  and  disinfecting  units,  and a 2%
increase  in  sales of  ductless  fume  enclosures,  partially  offset  by a 20%
reduction  in sales of wet scrubber  products and an 8% reduction in  ultrasonic
laboratory product sales.

Revenues  for the twelve  months ended June 30, 2004 were $39.1  million,  a 12%
increase  when  compared  with $34.9 million for the same period in fiscal 2003.
The Company  recorded  net income for the twelve  months  ended June 30, 2004 of
$1.7 million or $.25 per fully  diluted  share,  a 78% increase when compared to
net income of  $968,000 or $.15 per fully  diluted  share for the same period in
fiscal 2003.  Medical device product revenues increased 22% to $21.4 million and
laboratory and scientific  product revenues  increased 2% to $17.7 million.  The
increase in medical device product  revenues was attributed to a 38% increase in
therapeutic  medical  device  revenues  to $12.3  million  and a 6%  increase in
diagnostic  medical device revenues to $9.1 million.  The increase in laboratory
and scientific  product  revenues was mainly  attributable  to a 10% increase in
ultrasonic  laboratory  product  sales and a 6% increase in sales of  Labcaire's
endoscopic  cleaning and disinfecting units partially offset by a 5% decrease in
ductless fume enclosure sales and a 23% reduction in wet scrubber sales.

As of June 30,  2004,  the backlog of unfilled  orders was $8.7  million,  a 56%
increase  when compared  with $5.6 million as of June 30, 2003.  Medical  device
product backlog was $5.8 million, a 91% increase,  and laboratory and scientific
product backlog was $2.9 million,  a 15% increase,  respectively,  from June 30,
2003.

Mr. Michael McManus, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer,  commented,  "I
am very pleased to report our record  revenues and the 78% increase in earnings.
After resolving our past legal issues, we have not only shown steady growth, but
also continued to increase  revenues in our medical device  businesses.  Medical
devices  have shown  growth at a rate in excess of 20%. We also  continue to see
the kind of increase in backlog to provide the basis for our future growth.

"We expect medical device sales to grow as a result of sales of a newly designed
neuroaspirator,   continued  sales  of  the  SB500  and  the  market's   overall
recognition of the importance of High Intensity Focused Ultrasound technology.

"We have  completed  our animal  studies  with the  prototype of our product for
kidney and liver cancer treatment.  As previously reported, we have a submission
before the FDA for the approval of laparoscopic ablation of tissue.

"We anticipate our Sonora  business will continue to expand as a result of new R
& D efforts in probes,  MRI and probe  testing.  Recognition of that unique work
has resulted in the growing network of international distributors.

"We  expect  to see a pick up in the  sales  of our  laboratory  and  scientific
products  as a  result  of a  recovery  in  some of our  markets  and  from  the
identification of new market niches."

Mr. McManus continued, "We believe that the significant growth we are showing in
revenues  and  earnings  together  with our new  product  pipelines  establishes
Misonix as a leader in the application of ultrasound for medical devices."

Regarding  guidance,  the Company said that it is expecting to increase revenues
by 10%-15% and earnings by 30% for fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004.
