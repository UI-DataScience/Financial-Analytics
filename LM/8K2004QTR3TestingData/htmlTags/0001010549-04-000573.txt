Avatar Reports Second Quarter 2004 Results: Software Sales Up 115% Over Q2 2003

DALLAS,  Aug. 18  /PRNewswire-FirstCall/  -- Avatar Systems,  Inc. (OTC Bulletin
Board:  AVSY), the petroleum  industry's leading provider of integrated software
solutions,  announced  today a net income of $106,560 for the second  quarter of
2004,  up from a $17,628 net loss for Q2 2003.  For the 6 months  ended June 30,
2004,  net income rose to $63,631 from a net loss of $15,136 for the same period
of 2003.

The jump in net income is due to a 115% increase in software  sales from $79,568
in Q2 of 2003, to $171,519 in Q2 of 2004.  Software sales for the 6 months ended
June 30,  2004,  grew by 25.2% to $191,725  compared  to  $153,126  for the same
period last year.  "With oil prices at record  highs,  oil and gas companies are
embracing  new  technology  to  improve  efficiencies  and  make  their  current
resources more productive," said Chuck Shreve, President of Avatar Systems. "The
present  activity  in  the  energy  sector,  combined  with  Avatar's  increased
marketing  efforts in 2003, have attracted many new customers looking to upgrade
technology  as a way to save  their two most  valuable  commodities  -- time and
money."

Net revenues  for the second  quarter of 2004 were up 8% over those for Q2 2003,
increasing  from $431,719 to $466,203.  Net revenues for the 6 months ended June
30, 2004,  fell by 8.4% to $781,214  compared  with $852,620 for the same period
last year. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower hardware sales in the
second quarter when compared with an exceptional quarter ended June 20, 2003.

Shreve anticipates  Avatar's positive sales growth to continue.  "Avatar remains
committed  to fully  supporting  customer  needs with  exceptional  products and
service," he said. "Our ongoing  investment in research and development  ensures
that Avatar customers will continue to receive  affordable  solutions as well as
the most advanced technology designed for the petroleum industry."


Avatar Systems,  Inc. is based in Dallas, Texas. The company provides enterprise
resource  solutions  for  companies  engaged in the  petroleum  exploration  and
production industry. Currently, Avatar has a growing customer base of 300 on its
Petroware(TM)  products,  approximately  50 customers  utilizing  the  Company's
Avatar400(TM) IBM AS400 product, and 100 subscribers utilizing its ASP services.
Two years ago, Avatar  released its new 32 bit Windows based product,  Petroware
2000(TM),  which has had over 150 users since its release.  Avatar  launched its
ASP (Application Service Provider) "RAPID"(TM) product in 1998. Avatar's product
portfolio provides  excellent  assistance in the crucial function of effectively
managing a business in the petroleum industry.

accurate  and are  subject to  significant  risks and  uncertainties,  including
statements  to the future  financial  performance  of the Company.  Although the
Company  believes  that  the  expectations  reflected  in its  forward-  looking
statements are  reasonable,  it can give no assurance that such  expectations or
any of its  forward-looking  statements  will prove to be correct.  Factors that
could  cause  results to differ  include,  but are not  limited  to,  successful
performance of internal plans, product development and acceptance, the impact of

continued  to grow,"  said  Chuck  Shreve,  President  of Avatar  Systems.  "Our
business strategy is sharply focused on providing  innovative  solutions to meet
technology  needs unique to the petroleum  industry," he continued.  "A surge in
oil and natural gas prices has  prompted  oil and gas  companies  to embrace new
technology.  They are  choosing to invest in  Avatar's  advanced  technology  to
increase  efficiencies,  reduce operating costs, and make current resources more
productive."

Avatar products offer advanced  solutions for  accounting/financial  management,

expanded  feature/functionality,"  said  Shreve.  "Our  ongoing  development  of
sophisticated  technology  and  commitment  to superior  customer  support  have
enabled Avatar to maintain a positive net revenue,  positioning us among the Top
200 companies in one of the nation's largest metropolitan areas."

Avatar Announces Near Perfect Customer Satisfaction Survey Results

DALLAS,  Aug. 18  /PRNewswire-FirstCall/  -- Avatar Systems,  Inc. (OTC Bulletin
Board:  AVSY), the petroleum  industry's leading provider of integrated software
solutions,  today announced its 2004 Customer Satisfaction Survey results, which
remain high for both Avatar software products and customer support.

On a scale  of 1 to 5, 5 being  "excellent",  the  Avatar400(TM)  and  RAPID(TM)
products received an average 4.3 rating, and support for the products got a 4.7.
The  Petroware  2000(TM)  solution  was rated 4.2,  with support for the product
receiving a 4.6. The near perfect  ratings are  consistent  with survey  results
every year going back to 2001, when Avatar began conducting customer surveys.

"We realize that a vendor  retains and grows its customer base with  outstanding
products and support," said Chuck Shreve,  President of Avatar Systems.  "Avatar
is therefore highly committed to research and development to provide innovative,
cost-effective,  easy-to-use  products that work. Our  technology  solutions are
specifically  designed for the oil and gas business and  supported by people who
are oil and gas experts.  Not only does our support staff  understand the Avatar
software  and  nuances of the  petroleum  industry,  but we strive to treat each
customer as if they are the only one we have. As a result, customers view Avatar
as an extension of their own companies."

"Accessibility  is key to customer  support,"  Shreve  continued.  Avatar's call
management  system  ensures  that no  customer  is  forgotten,  with most  calls
returned  within 30 minutes and all calls  returned by the end of business  day.
"We're interested in building more than just a business  alliance," said Shreve.
"We believe in a hands-on  approach  that builds  personal  relationships  while
addressing the unique needs of every customer."

Because  Avatar puts this  philosophy  into action,  customer  retention rate is
high, many companies having been with Avatar for over 20 years. More than 50% of
Avatar's  business  comes  from  referrals.   According  to  Shreve,   "Avatar's
customer-centric business strategy continues to grow our customer base and is at
the core of our ongoing success."

Avatar Systems,  Inc. is based in Dallas, Texas. The company provides enterprise

Avatar Offers ASP Hosted Environment for Petroware 2000(TM)

DALLAS,  Aug. 18  /PRNewswire-FirstCall/  -- Avatar Systems,  Inc. (OTC Bulletin
Board:  AVSY), the petroleum  industry's leading provider of integrated software
solutions,  continues to  successfully  add new  customers to its new  Petroware
2000(TM) ASP  (application  service  provider)  hosted  environment.  Avatar has
signed 4 customers in 4 months,  since  instigating the subscription  service in
April 2004.

"Avatar has been in the ASP  business  for years,  providing  a network  hosting
environment  for 50 large users of the  Avatar400(TM)  IBM AS400  product," said
Chuck Shreve,  President of Avatar  Systems.  "Given the direction of technology
and the move toward ASPs,  it just made sense to extend this service to users of
our popular Petroware 2000 solution."

The ASP network  infrastructure is maintained at Avatar  headquarters in Dallas,
Texas,  where a Dual  Pentium  Dell  Power  Edge  server  is  dedicated  to each
Petroware 2000 ASP customer. The system offers full processing capabilities,  to
include  running  reports and  entering  transactions.  In addition to power and
storage  redundancy,  the sophisticated  network environment is supported by the
most robust backup equipment  available on the market,  providing high capacity,
high-speed data backup.

"By offering  Petroware 2000 in an ASP  environment,  Avatar is giving lower and
middle  market  customers  the  opportunity  to take  advantage of software they
couldn't  otherwise  afford to license,"  said Shreve.  "An annual  subscription
gives oil and gas companies  high-speed  Internet access to process data and top
quality network and server  infrastructures  on which to run it. They don't need
to purchase a server or perform backup. All customers need to access our network
is an Internet connection from anywhere in the world."

In spite of the fact that Avatar has conducted no marketing to date, interest in
the Petroware  2000 ASP program is strong.  Avatar plans to initiate a marketing
effort in the third  quarter  of this  year.  "We  expect to see a surge in this
sector of business as all  applications  move  toward  Internet  delivery in the
future," said Shreve.  "Like our maintenance  agreement,  the Petroware 2000 ASP
program is a recurring  revenue model,  which we anticipate will produce a major
revenue  stream in 3 to 5 years.  To generate  additional  revenue,  Avatar will
consider  leveraging the network structure by hosting third party  applications,
including those outside the oil and gas industry."

Avatar Systems,  Inc. is based in Dallas, Texas. The company provides enterprise
resource  solutions  for  companies  engaged in the  petroleum  exploration  and
production industry. Currently, Avatar has a growing customer base of 300 on its
Petroware(TM)  products,  approximately  50 customers  utilizing  the  Company's
