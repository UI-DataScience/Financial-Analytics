            Semtech Second Quarter Sales up 10 Percent Sequentially;
                  Record Gross Margin Achieved in the Quarter

     CAMARILLO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 24, 2004--

                       Greater Than 1:1 Book-to-Bill Ratio

     SEMTECH CORPORATION (Nasdaq:SMTC), a leading producer of high performance
analog and mixed-signal semiconductors, today announced that net sales and net
income for its second quarter that ended July 25, 2004 were up significantly
over the first quarter and the prior year period. Operating income was 31
percent of net sales in the second quarter and net income represented a 26
percent after-tax-margin. Semtech generated $21.4 million of operating cash flow
in the second quarter and spent $13.0 million to buy back 619,000 shares of its
common stock.
     Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 were $68.3 million, up
53 percent from $44.6 million in the prior year second quarter. As a result of
higher sales and record gross margin, net income for the second quarter of
fiscal year 2005 was $17.4 million or 22 cents per diluted share. Net income for
the second quarter of last year was $2.4 million or 3 cents per diluted share,
which included a pre-tax charge of $6.8 million or net-of-tax 7 cents per
diluted share impact related to the Company's calling of its convertible
subordinated notes.
     For the first six months of fiscal year 2005, net sales were up 47 percent
to $130.2 million and net income nearly tripled to $32.2 million or 41 cents per
diluted share. Net sales in the first six months of fiscal year 2004 were $88.6
million and net income was $10.7 million or 14 cents per share.
     New orders in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 exceeded shipments for
the period, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of greater than 1:1. The strongest
growth came from the Company's timing and synchronization or SETS product line
used in high-speed communications, which saw new orders grow 32 percent over the
first quarter. The Human Input Device (HID) unit also saw meaningful order
growth, due in part to a new design win for the MicroBuddy(R) device being used
in a high volume digital video recorder.
     Net sales were up 10 percent sequentially in the second quarter of fiscal
year 2005 compared to the first quarter, driven by growth in Power Management,
HID, SETS, and Protection products. Shipments of Semtech's two largest product
lines, Power Management and Protection, are both up more than 50 percent
compared to the prior year period. The expansion in sales reflected ongoing
demand tied to cellular handsets and consumer electronics, as well as a modest
recovery in the computer segment.
     Jason Carlson, Semtech's President and Chief Executive Officer commented,
"I was most pleased with the new orders and shipment levels achieved by our SETS
product line in the second quarter. The emerging product lines of SETS and HID
have been areas of investment by Semtech for more than 4 years. In the case of
SETS, we are penetrating a relatively new end-market for Semtech, where HID
represents increased content in portable applications we are already
supporting."

     Third Quarter Outlook

     Semtech estimates that net sales for the third quarter that ends October
31, 2004 will be up 3 to 5 percent over the second quarter. Turns orders (orders
received and shipped in the same quarter) of approximately 32 percent are
required to achieve this forecast. Earnings in the third quarter are forecasted
to be 23 cents per diluted share. Per the Company's fiscal calendar, the third
quarter of fiscal year 2005 will be a 14-week quarter.

     Statements contained in this release that are not historical facts are
forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities

cellular phones, personal computers and automated test equipment, demand for
semiconductor devices in general, demand for the Company's products in
particular, competitors' actions, supply from key third-party silicon wafer
foundries and assembly contractors, manufacturing costs and yields, relations
with strategic customers, and risks associated with the businesses of major
customers. Other factors that may cause actual results to differ from the
forward-looking statements contained in this press release and that may affect
the Company's prospects in general are described in the Company's filings with
