        CORINTHIAN COLLEGES REPORTS FISCAL 2004 REVENUES OF $804 MILLION,
                     AN INCREASE OF 55% OVER THE PRIOR YEAR

SANTA ANA, CA, SEPTEMBER 1, 2004 - CORINTHIAN COLLEGES, INC. (NASDAQ:COCO) today
reported operating results for its fiscal 2004 year and fourth quarter ended
June 30, 2004.

FISCAL 2004 FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS:

- -     Revenues increased 56.3% to $217.1 million compared with $138.9 million in
      the 2003 fourth quarter.

- -     Operating income increased 2.1% to $30.0 million compared with $29.3
      million in the corresponding prior-year period.

- -     Net income increased 5.9% to $19.1 million compared with $18.0 million in
      the 2003 fourth quarter.

FISCAL 2004 HIGHLIGHTS:

- -     Revenues increased 55.5% to $804.3 million compared with $517.3 million in
      fiscal 2003.

- -     Operating income increased 23.4% to $135.3 million compared with $109.7
      million in fiscal 2003.

- -     Net income increased 23.8% to $81.6 million compared with $65.9 million in
      fiscal 2003.

Same-school revenues increased 21.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004
compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Same schools are defined as
those colleges that have been owned and operated by the company for four full
quarters. Core growth revenues increased 26.0% in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004 compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Core growth is defined as
the increase in total revenues, excluding revenues attributable to colleges
acquired within the last four full quarters.

Net income for the fourth quarter was $19.1 million, or $0.20 per diluted share,
in line with the company's revised guidance, and includes costs of approximately
$2.1 million ($3.2 million pre-tax) or approximately $0.02 per

diluted share related to facility closings at LTU and severance charges. This
compares with net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of $18.0 million,
or $0.20 per diluted share.

Net income for fiscal 2004 rose 23.8% to $81.6 million, or $0.87 per diluted
share, also in line with the company's revised guidance, from $65.9 million, or
$0.72 per diluted share, in fiscal 2003. This amount includes charges of
approximately $3.9 million ($6.4 million pre-tax) or approximately $0.04 per
diluted share associated with both the impairment charge at LTU taken in the
third quarter of fiscal 2004 and the facility closing costs and severance costs
reflected in the fourth quarter.

The weighted average number of shares outstanding and all per share calculations
reflect the company's two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock
dividend and paid March 23, 2004. The weighted average number of diluted shares
outstanding for the 2004 fourth quarter and year end were 94.2 million and 94.0
million, respectively, compared with 92.8 million and 92.1 million for the
respective periods in fiscal 2003.

David G. Moore, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Fiscal 2004 was a
year of investment in the future of Corinthian, a year in which we acquired 57
colleges and 15 training centers, opened a record 10 new branch campuses and
remodeled, relocated or expanded 35 additional campuses as we also expanded our
extensive library of high quality curricula. Throughout this period of growth
and investment, we remained focused on delivering to our students high quality,
employer-driven education in attractive facilities. Although the investments
made in fiscal 2004 have restrained our operating performance in the short-term,
we believe they establish a solid platform for Corinthian's future growth in
North America."

Further underscoring Corinthian's investment in future growth, Corinthian
adopted a record 147 programs into its schools in fiscal 2004, with 82 program
adoptions into U.S. schools and 65 into Canadian schools. This compares with 50
program adoptions in fiscal 2003, when the company only operated within the
United States. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, Corinthian's campuses
adopted 47 programs, with 39 program adoptions into colleges in the U.S. and
eight program adoptions into schools in Canada. Program adoptions are typically
dilutive to earnings in the short term, but provide campuses and prospective
students with relevant, high quality employer-driven curricula.

Income from operations for the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter amounted to
approximately $30.0 million or 13.8% of revenues as indicated in the company's
pre-release of August 2, 2004. This compares with $29.3 million or 21.1% of
revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and compared with $35.6 million or
16.4% of revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. Income from operations
for fiscal 2004 increased 23.4% to $135.3 million or 16.8% of revenues compared
with $109.7 million or 21.2% of revenues in fiscal 2003.

Income from operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 reflects higher
educational services expenses, marketing and admissions expenses as well as the
previously mentioned facility closing costs and severance expenses, partially
offset by a reduction in general and administrative expenses.

Income from operations as a percent of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004 was further restrained by an increase in new branch campus openings, with
three new branch campuses opened during the 2004 fourth quarter contrasted to
two opened in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. In total, Corinthian opened 10
new branch campuses during the full fiscal 2004, compared with six new branch
campuses opened during fiscal 2003. New branch campuses have typically achieved
breakeven between nine and 12 months after opening.

Additional factors contributing to the reduction in fourth quarter operating
margin were the acquisitions in fiscal 2004 that have lower operating margins
than typical Corinthian colleges and the campuses that were remodeled, expanded
or relocated during fiscal 2004. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 amounted to
approximately $64.7 million, more than double fiscal 2003's $30.8 million.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, educational services expenses increased to
55.5% of revenues compared with 50.0% of revenues in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2003. The increase in educational services was due primarily to the
investments Corinthian made in the future in acquisitions completed in fiscal
2004, the 10 new branch campuses opened in fiscal 2004, the expansion,
relocation or remodel of 35 existing campuses and the adoption of 147 programs
into campuses. These investments in initiatives to drive future growth resulted
in an increase in salaries and wages to 27.0% of revenues compared with 24.0% of
revenues in fiscal 2003. Additionally, rent and occupancy expenses increased to
8.6% of revenues compared with 7.6% of revenues in fiscal 2003, classroom and
bookstore costs rose to 6.0% of revenues compared with 5.7% of revenues in
fiscal 2003, and depreciation and amortization increased to 2.4% of revenues
compared with 1.8% of revenues in fiscal 2003. Bad debt expenses increased to
4.2% of revenues compared with 3.4% of revenues in fiscal 2003.

Educational services expenses amounted to 52.1% of revenues for fiscal 2004,
compared with 48.6% of revenues in fiscal 2003.

Marketing and admissions expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 amounted
to $49.3 million or 22.7% of revenues compared with $28.2 million or 20.3% of
revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Marketing and admissions expenses
were 22.5% of revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. During the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004, lead flow into the campuses in the U.S., excluding FMU
Online, was derived 28% from the Internet and 64% from sources such as
television, direct mail and newspaper advertising. Marketing and admissions
expenses amounted to 22.2% of revenues in fiscal 2004, compared with 20.6% of
revenues in fiscal 2003.

General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004
amounted to $14.2 million or 6.5% of revenue compared with $11.9 million or 8.5%
of revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and $19.3 million or 8.9% of
revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. The improvement in general and
administrative expenses as a percent of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004 was due primarily to the reversal of a bonus accrual of approximately $3.1
million. Corinthian accrues bonuses throughout the fiscal year based on
pre-determined operating results targets, and reversed the accrual after
operating performance deteriorated in the fourth quarter. General and
administrative expenses amounted to 8.1% of revenues for fiscal 2004, compared
with 9.6% of revenues in fiscal 2003.

Impairment, facility closings and severance expenses amounted to $3.2 million or
1.5% of revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, and includes the
previously disclosed facility closing costs of the two LTU campuses in Southern
California and severance expenses of approximately $900,000. Impairment,
facility closings and severance expenses for fiscal 2004 amounted to $6.4
million or 0.8% of revenues and primarily consisted of the third quarter fiscal
2004 impairment charge related to LTU of approximately $3.2 million in addition
to the enumerated fourth quarter costs.

ADDITIONAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

Total student population rose to 64,810 at June 30, 2004, an increase of 49.9%
compared with 43,229 students at June 30, 2003. Same school student population
grew by 15.1% over the fourth quarter of last year.

For fiscal 2004, total student starts increased 55.4% and same school student
starts increased 16.6% when compared with fiscal 2003. Total new student starts
for the fourth quarter increased 51.0% to 21,258, and same school student starts
for the quarter rose 12.3% compared with 13.5% in the fourth quarter last year.

Exclusively online student population at Corinthian's FMU Online campus grew by
approximately 266% to 2,035 students at June 15, 2004. During fiscal 2004,
online course registrations increased 58% to 43,046 compared with 27,271 in
fiscal 2003. Total online course registrations for the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004 increased to 12,824, up 68.4% from 7,615 online course registrations a year
ago. At June 30, 2004, Corinthian offered students a choice of 173 courses
online and 12 exclusively online accredited degrees. Three more exclusively
online degrees were added in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Corinthian
currently offers 15 exclusively online degrees, including associate, bachelor
and master's degrees in accounting, business, and criminal justice and associate
and bachelor's degrees in paralegal, homeland security and computer information.
