Item 2.02.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

     On September 9, 2004,  CBRL Group,  Inc.  issued the press  release that is
furnished  as Exhibit  99.1 to this  Current  Report on Form 8-K,  which by this
reference is incorporated  herein as if copied verbatim,  with respect to fourth
quarter and year-end  results,  current sales trends,  earnings guidance for the
first fiscal quarter and fiscal 2005, other  information and the conference call
to be held to discuss this information.


Item 7.01.  Regulation FD Disclosure.

     The  information  set forth in Item 2.02 above is incorporated by reference
as if fully set forth herein.

     On September 8, 2004,  Cracker  Barrel Old Country  Store,  Inc.  ("Cracker
Barrel"), a wholly owned subsidiary of CBRL Group, Inc. (the "Company"), reached
agreement in principle to settle  certain  litigation  pending  against  Cracker
Barrel.  Final settlement  documentation  has been negotiated and upon receiving
appropriate  signatures,  which is expected to occur  within the next few weeks,
dismissals with prejudice will be entered in the litigation in question.

     The  litigation  being  resolved  by the  announced  settlements  has  been
previously  described in the Company's  reports filed with the  Commission.  See
Part II, Item 1 of the Company's  Quarterly  Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended April 30, 2004 filed with the  Commission on June 2, 2004.  The litigation
being resolved consists of:

    (1)       Serena McDermott and Jennifer Gentry v. Cracker Barrel Old Country
              Store,  Inc.,  4:99-CV-0001-HLM  (United States District Court for
              the Northern  District of Georgia  ("NDG")),  a collective  action
              under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act involving approximately
              10,000 opt-in plaintiffs ("McDermott");
    (2)       Kelvis  Rhodes,  Maria Stokes et al. v. Cracker Barrel Old Country
              Store, Inc.,  4:99-CV-217-HLM  (NDG), an action under Title VII of
              the Civil  Rights Act of 1964 and Section 1981 of the Civil Rights
              Act of 1866 involving 13 individual plaintiffs;
    (3)       Flounice  Stanley,  Calvin  Slack et al.  v.  Cracker  Barrel  Old
              Country Store,  Inc.,  4:01-CV-326-HLM  (NDG), a collective action
              under the FLSA involving 3 remaining individual plaintiffs;
    (4)       National  Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Betty
              Thomas  et  al.  v.  Cracker  Barrel  Old  Country  Store,   Inc.,
              4:01-CV-325-HLM  (NDG),  an  action  under  Title II of the  Civil
              Rights  Act of 1964 and  Section  1981 of the Civil  Rights Act of
              1866 involving 40 individual plaintiffs  ("Thomas"),  and of these
              40 individual plaintiffs, 2 have elected not to participate in the
              settlement; and
    (5)       actions similar to Thomas brought by 62 individual  plaintiffs in
              Arkansas,  North Carolina and Mississippi.

<PAGE>

     Cracker Barrel has agreed to make payments totaling $8.7 million, including
all attorneys' fees, in complete  settlement of the above described  litigation.
Of that amount,  $3.5 million pre-tax was previously accrued in fiscal 2001 when
Cracker Barrel made offers of judgment in the McDermott case.

     As previously  reported,  Cracker  Barrel entered into a consent order with
the U.S. Department of Justice resolving allegations similar to Thomas.  Cracker
Barrel is currently  implementing  that consent  order.  Cracker  Barrel did not
admit any wrongdoing  and expressly  denied  wrongdoing.  Cracker Barrel reached
agreement in order to avoid  expensive and  protracted  litigation.  The Company
views the  settlements as prudent  actions that are in the best interests of the
Company, its employees, its shareholders, and its guests.

     These  settlements  will  result  in an after tax  charge to net  income of
approximately  $3.3 million,  or  approximately  $0.07 per diluted share, in the
fourth  quarter of the fiscal year ended July 30,  2004.  The total  incremental
cost of these  settlements,  however,  is believed to be less than the potential
expense of continuing to litigate and bringing these cases to  conclusion.  This
charge was not  included  in the  Company's  previously  announced  guidance  of
expected diluted net income per share of $0.65-$0.68 for the fourth quarter. See
Exhibit 99 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission
on June 17, 2004,  which by this reference is  incorporated  herein as if copied
verbatim. Likewise, this charge does not account for the possible effects of any
insurance recoveries that might be received.  The Company considers it premature
to estimate what those amounts might be, if any.

     See the press release issued by Cracker Barrel  furnished hereto as Exhibit
99.2 and incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

   CBRL GROUP, INC. ANNOUNCES FISCAL 2004 FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-END RESULTS

 Announces Effect of Settlement of Previously Disclosed Private Litigation and
                         Schedule for Press Releases to
                Report Financial Results and Earnings Guidance,
           Reports Sales Trends and Provides Guidance for Fiscal 2005

LEBANON,  Tenn. (September 9, 2004) -- CBRL Group, Inc. (the "Company") (NASDAQ:
CBRL) today  announced  results for its fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 ended July
30,  2004,  reporting  diluted net income per share of $0.60,  which  included a
charge of $0.07 per diluted share  related to  settlement of certain  previously
reported private lawsuits against its Cracker Barrel Old Country Store(R),  Inc.
("Cracker Barrel")  subsidiary.  The settlement is discussed more fully later in
this press  release  and in a Form 8-K filed with the  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission today.  Before the effect of the settlement  charge, the results were
in line with the  Company's  most  recent  guidance  for the fiscal  2004 fourth
quarter of  between  $0.65-$0.68  per  share,  and down from $0.70 in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003. The  settlement  charge had an effect of $0.07 and $0.06
per  diluted  share on the  quarter  and full year,  respectively.  The  Company
reported fiscal 2004 full-year diluted net income per share of $2.25,  including
the $0.06  settlement  charge,  compared with $2.09 in fiscal 2003. In addition,
the Company  reported  sales trends for August of fiscal 2005,  guidance for the
first quarter and full year of fiscal 2005, and announced a change to the future
timing and content of its regular press releases for reporting financial results
and earnings guidance during fiscal 2005.

         Highlights of the fiscal 2004  fourth-quarter  and year-end results and
fiscal 2005 sales trends include:

     -     Reached  a  mediated  settlement  in  principle  on  long-outstanding
           litigation  resulting  in a charge to diluted net income per share of
           $0.07 for the fourth quarter and $0.06 for the full year.
<PAGE>

     -     Diluted  net income per share for the full year of fiscal 2004 was up
           7.7% (10.5% before the effect of the $0.06  settlement  charge),  and
           net income  was up 6.3% (9.5%  before  the  settlement  charge)  from
           fiscal 2003 on an 8.3% increase in total revenue.

     -     Diluted  net income per share for the fourth  quarter of fiscal  2004
           was down  14.3%  (4.3%  before  the  effect of the  $0.07  settlement
           charge),  and net income was down 15.8% (6.4%  before the  settlement
           charge) from the fourth  quarter of fiscal 2003 on a 4.7% increase in
           total revenue.

     -     Comparable  store restaurant sales for the fourth fiscal quarter were
           down 0.6% for the Company's Cracker Barrel operations, and comparable
           store retail sales at Cracker Barrel were down 3.1%.

     -     Comparable  restaurant  sales for the fourth  fiscal  quarter were up
           5.6% in the Company's Logan's Roadhouse(R) ("Logan's") restaurants.

     -     Full-year  fiscal 2004 comparable  store restaurant sales for Cracker
           Barrel were up 2.0% from fiscal 2003,  marking the fifth  consecutive
           year of positive comparable store restaurant sales at Cracker Barrel,
           and comparable  store retail sales for the full fiscal year increased
           5.3%.

     -     Full-year fiscal 2004 comparable restaurant sales for Logan's
           increased 4.8%.

     -     Operating  income margin for the full fiscal year decreased 0.1% as a
           percent of revenue  compared with a year earlier,  but increased 0.1%
           before the settlement charge.

     -     Net cash  provided by operating  activities  for the full fiscal year
           was  approximately  $200 million,  marking five consecutive  years in
           which cash  provided by operating  activities  has exceeded cash used
           for capital expenditures (purchase of property and equipment) and the
           fourth consecutive year this excess was more than $50 million.

     -     Comparable store restaurant sales for the four weeks ended August 27,
           2004,  the first  month of fiscal  2005,  increased  1.8% in  Cracker
           Barrel and 3.9% in Logan's.  Comparable store retail sales in Cracker
           Barrel were down 1.6% in the  period.  (See  discussion  below on new
           reporting being adopted in fiscal 2005).

Fourth-Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results

     The Company also noted Cracker Barrel's  announcement that yesterday it had
reached a settlement in principle of certain  previously  reported lawsuits that
alleged  discrimination  in  employment  and  public  accommodation  as  well as
violations  of the Fair Labor  Standards  Act.  Under  terms of the  settlement,
Cracker Barrel will pay $8.7 million to various  parties in order to resolve the
litigation.  The Company  previously accrued $3.5 million before taxes in fiscal
2001  related  to  certain  of the  cases,  resulting  in a net charge now being
recorded in its fourth  quarter of fiscal  2004 of  approximately  $3.3  million
after  taxes,  or $0.07 per diluted  share for the fourth  quarter and $0.06 per
diluted share for the full fiscal year.

     Total revenue for the fourth  fiscal  quarter ended July 30, 2004 of $607.5
million increased 4.7% from the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003.  Comparable store
restaurant sales for the fourth quarter for the Cracker Barrel concept decreased
0.6%,  including a 1.9% higher average check, 1.7% of which reflected menu price
increases,  and 2.5% lower  guest  traffic.  Comparable  store  retail  sales at
Cracker Barrel  decreased 3.1% for the quarter.  Logan's  comparable  restaurant
sales for the  quarter  were up 5.6% as  average  check  increased  4.6%,  which
<PAGE>
included approximately 3.0% of menu price increases, and guest traffic increased
1.0%. During the quarter,  the Company opened eight new Cracker Barrel units and
one new franchised Logan's location.

     The Company  reported  net income for the fourth  quarter of fiscal 2004 of
$29.9 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, down from net income of $35.5 million
and diluted net income per share of $0.70 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.
Fourth  quarter fiscal 2004 net income and diluted net income per share included
after-tax  litigation  settlement  charges of $3.3 million and $0.07 per diluted
share,  respectively,  before which net income was $33.3 million and diluted net
income per share was $0.67. Before the settlement charges,  the reported diluted
net  income  per share  results  were in line  with the  Company's  most  recent
guidance of diluted net income per share of  $0.65-$0.68  for the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2004.

     Operating  income for the fourth quarter declined 14.9% from the prior year
and fell from 9.9% of total  revenue  for the fourth  quarter of fiscal  2003 to
8.0% in the fourth  quarter of fiscal  2004.  The  decline in  operating  income
margin  reflected  litigation   settlement  charges  (included  in  general  and
administrative  expense),  higher cost of goods sold, including the effects of a
mid-single  digit  percentage  increase in overall  commodity  costs, and higher
labor and other operating expenses, partly offset by lower bonus expenses.

     Commenting on the  fourth-quarter  results,  CBRL Group, Inc. President and
Chief Executive  Officer Michael A. Woodhouse said, "We are pleased that Cracker
Barrel has reached the  mediated  litigation  settlement.  Apart from the charge
associated with the settlement, we achieved our earnings guidance for the fourth
quarter in an  environment  of  widely-reported  weakening  sales  trends in the
industry and significant ongoing commodity cost pressures. We were encouraged by
improvements in comparable  store restaurant sales trends at both Cracker Barrel
and Logan's from the early part of the quarter,  as Cracker Barrel  recovered to
positive to last year and Logan's was up approximately 6% in fiscal July.

     "Despite  these  external  factors,  we  continue  to focus on  operational
execution in our  restaurants,  and we were very pleased to receive  recognition
from consumers that we are delivering outstanding experiences for our guests. We
were very proud to mark the 35th  anniversary  of Cracker  Barrel by being named
`Best  Family  Dining  Chain  in  America'  for  the  14th  consecutive  year by
Restaurants  and  Institutions  magazine.  Also, in J.D.  Power and  Associates'
inaugural  study of customer  satisfaction in the restaurant  industry,  Cracker
Barrel  scored the  highest  among  family  dining  chains in  overall  customer
satisfaction  in its core market regions and the second highest in those regions
among all family and casual dining chains."

Full-Year Fiscal 2004 Results

     For the full fiscal year ended July 30, 2004, the Company  reported revenue
of $2.4 billion compared with $2.2 billion for fiscal 2003, an increase of 8.3%.
Comparable  store  restaurant  sales for Cracker Barrel were up 2.0% from a year
ago,  including a 1.7% increase in average check and 0.3% higher guest  traffic,
while retail sales increased 5.3%. Fiscal 2004 marked the fifth consecutive full
year of positive  comparable store  restaurant sales at Cracker Barrel.  Logan's
comparable  restaurant  sales for fiscal 2004  increased  4.8% from fiscal 2003,

<PAGE>

with average check rising 1.7% and guest traffic  increasing  3.1%.  The Company
opened 24 Cracker  Barrel units,  and 11  company-operated  and four  franchised
Logan's restaurants during fiscal 2004.

     Operating income for fiscal 2004 increased 6.4% from fiscal 2003, including
the  effect of the  settlement  charge,  but  operating  margin of 7.8% of total
revenue was 0.1% below  prior  year.  Before the  settlement  charge,  operating
income improved 9.3% from fiscal 2003, and operating income margin improved as a
percent of total  revenue from 7.9% in fiscal 2003 to 8.0% in fiscal  2004.  Net
income  for the full year  increased  to $113.3  million,  or $2.25 per  diluted
share, from $106.5 million, or $2.09 per diluted share, for the full year fiscal
2003, reflecting increases of 6.3% and 7.7%, respectively (before the settlement
charge the increases were 9.5% and 10.5%, respectively).

     Net cash  provided by operating  activities  was $200.4  million for fiscal
2004,   $55.8  million  more  than  the  Company's  $144.6  million  in  capital
expenditures  (purchase of property and equipment).  This marks five consecutive
years where net cash  provided by operating  activities  exceeded the  Company's
capital expenditure outlays and the fourth consecutive year this excess was more
than $50  million.  In fiscal  2004,  the  excess  net cash was used  toward the
repurchase  of 1.8  million  shares  of the  Company's  common  stock  for $69.2
million.  Since  beginning its share  repurchase  activities in fiscal 1999, the
Company has repurchased 22.7 million shares for $593.7 million. The Company also
increased its dividend payments in fiscal 2004 by over $15 million.

     No share  repurchases were made during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter.
Shortly  after  the  Company   announced  a  new  2-million   share   repurchase
authorization  during the quarter,  mediation activity in the pending litigation
(settlement of which is being  announced by Cracker  Barrel today)  intensified.
Accordingly,  the Company suspended share repurchases  during these discussions,
which  at any time  during  their  course  could  have  resulted  in a  mediated
settlement.  Now that a final  settlement  has been  reached  in  principle  and
disclosed, the Company expects to resume its share repurchase activity.

     Woodhouse commented on the full-year results, saying, "We are pleased that,
apart from the  effects of the  settlement  charge,  we  delivered  double-digit
growth in diluted net income per share and an  improvement  in operating  income
margin during a year marked by extraordinarily  unfavorable factors in commodity
markets.

     "We  continue to expect to generate  strong cash flow well in excess of our
capital expenditure needs, and we have a clear strategy for managing our capital
structure and returning capital to our shareholders  through dividends and share
repurchases.  We  believe  that we  have  two  strong  brands  with  experienced
leadership  teams in place who will  guide us to  achievement  of our  long-term
operating and financial objectives."

Sales Trends

     The  Company  urges  caution  in  considering  its  current  trends and the
earnings guidance  disclosed in this press release.  The restaurant  industry is
highly competitive,  and trends and guidance are subject to numerous factors and
influences, some of which are discussed in the cautionary language at the end of
this press release.  The Company  disclaims any  obligation to update  disclosed

<PAGE>

information on trends or targets other than in its periodic  filings under Forms
10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

     The  Company  announced  that it is changing  its  protocol  for  regularly
reporting sales results and earnings  guidance.  The expected  calendar of dates
for the Company's  expected press releases  announcing  results is at the end of
this  release.  The primary  changes are that the Company  will begin  reporting
comparable store sales results for its fiscal monthly  periods,  instead of on a
quarter-to-date  basis, and does not expect to provide updated earnings guidance
with every sales update.  The Company  believes that these changes will make the
timing of disclosure of its results more  consistent with that of many others in
the restaurant  industry and improve  comparability of sales results from update
to  update.  The  Company  has  provided  a table  at the  end of  this  release
reflecting  comparable  store sales for each period of fiscal 2004 under the new
reporting protocol for comparison.

     The Company  reported that Cracker  Barrel's  comparable  store  restaurant
sales for  August  of  fiscal  2005 (the four  weeks  ending  August  27,  2004)
increased  1.8%,  including  an  increase  of 2.9% in  average  check,  of which
approximately  1.7% reflected menu price increases.  This increase compares with
the comparable  store  restaurant sales increase of 1.5% in the August period of
fiscal  2004.  Comparable  retail  sales for  Cracker  Barrel  in fiscal  August
decreased  1.6%  (compared  with an 8.5% increase in the August period of fiscal
2004),  including  the  unfavorable  comparison  for the last day of the  fiscal
period to a porch sale event over Labor Day weekend  last year. A porch sale was
held this year also over Labor Day weekend,  but the holiday fell one week later
this year.  Logan's  comparable  store  restaurant sales grew 3.9% in the August
period  versus a year  ago  (compared  with  0.9% in  August  of  fiscal  2004),
including 5.2% higher average check, of which 3.0% reflected higher menu prices.
The Company  indicated  that there were no apparent net material  sales  impacts
from  either  adverse  weather  or the  Olympics  in  August,  although  certain
individual stores did lose sales during Hurricane Charley.

     To aid in the  transition to the new reporting  protocol,  the Company also
reported  quarter-to-date  sales  trends for the nearly  six-week  period of its
first fiscal quarter in 2005.  This is the final reporting of sales trends under
the  previous  quarter-to-date   approach.   Quarter-to-date   comparable  store
restaurant sales at Cracker Barrel  increased  approximately 2% from prior year,
including  approximately 3% higher average check, of which approximately  1.5-2%
reflected menu price increases.  Comparable store retail sales at Cracker Barrel
decreased   approximately  1.5-2%   quarter-to-date.   Logan's   quarter-to-date
comparable restaurant sales increased  approximately 4.5%, including an increase
of approximately 5% in average check, of which approximately 3% reflected higher
menu  prices and  approximately  0.2%  reflected  increased  alcohol  sales as a
percent of total sales.  Quarter-to-date  sales trends  reflected  the effect of
store closings  caused by Hurricane  Frances  during the Labor Day weekend.  The
Company  estimates that  quarter-to-date  comparable store restaurant sales were
reduced by approximately  0.5-1% at Cracker Barrel and  approximately  0-0.5% at
Logan's as a result lost sales from  Hurricane  Frances.  Retail sales appear to
have been affected by a greater  amount,  approximately  1-1.5%,  because of the
lost or reduced porch sale in many locations.

<PAGE>

     Woodhouse  commented  on the  trends,  "We are  pleased  by the  sequential
improvements  in  Cracker  Barrel's   restaurant   sales  trends,   and  by  the
continuation of Logan's solid sales performance.  These results represent a good
start for our fiscal year."

Fiscal 2005 Earnings Guidance

     The  Company's  present  guidance  for diluted net income per share for the
first  quarter of fiscal 2005,  which ends October 29, 2004, is for a percentage
increase up to the mid-single digits from $0.56 in the year-ago quarter on total
percentage revenue growth in the high single digits.  Earnings guidance reflects
many assumptions,  many of which cannot be known,  including,  very importantly,
sales  expectations.  The Company presently expects  comparable store restaurant
sales for the full first quarter to be up  approximately  1-3% at Cracker Barrel
and up  approximately  4-5% at Logan's,  with  comparable  store retail sales at
Cracker  Barrel  expected to be flat to up  approximately  2% compared  with the
year-ago quarter. The Company presently expects operating income margins for the
quarter to be down slightly from prior year, primarily reflecting that fact that
the Company has not yet lapped the  significant  commodity  cost  increases that
began in the second  quarter of the prior  fiscal  year.  The Company  presently
expects to open five new Cracker Barrel units in the first quarter, of which one
has already opened, and seven new Logan's company-operated units, of which three
have already opened.

     For  the  full-year  of  fiscal  2005,  the  Company  presently  expects  a
percentage  increase in diluted net income per share in the mid-teens from $2.31
(excluding  the  effects of the  settlement  charge)  for  fiscal  2004 on total
revenue of approximately $2.6 billion and operating margin approximately flat to
prior year  (excluding the effects of the settlement  charge).  During the year,
the Company  presently  expects to open 25 new Cracker  Barrel  units and 18 new
Logan's company-owned and five new franchised restaurants. The Company presently
expects  full-year cash provided by operating  activities to exceed its $160-165
million  projected  capital  expenditure  requirements  by as much  as  $100-110
million.  This would represent the sixth consecutive year in which cash provided
by  operations  exceeded  outlays for the purchase of property and equipment and
the fifth  consecutive  year that the excess was at least $50 million.  As noted
above, the Company presently expects to resume repurchasing shares of its common
stock in the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  2005,  and it has 2.9  million  shares
remaining to repurchase under existing authorizations.

     In  addition to the many risks and  uncertainties  listed at the end of the
narrative  portion of this press release,  the Company notes a certain  specific
risk that is excluded from its guidance,  but which likely would have a material
impact on its  guidance  if it  occurred.  The Company  noted that its  earnings
guidance does not include the potential  effect of a change in accounting  rules
for convertible  debt proposed by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF 04-08) of
the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  that  would  require  the  use  of
"if-converted"  accounting  for  contingently  convertible  debt  regardless  of
whether the  contingency  allowing debt holders to convert is met. Under current
rules (FAS 128),  contingently  issuable  shares  should be  included as diluted
shares  outstanding  only when the  contingency  is met. The present  contingent
conversion share price is $48.21,  and the Company's  convertible  notes may not
actually be converted unless its common shares close at this price for 20 of the

<PAGE>

last 30 trading days of the present fiscal quarter.  This contingent  conversion
price increases over time. Should the rule change be adopted,  the Company would
be required to include  approximately  4.6 million  shares in its diluted shares
outstanding  related to its convertible  debt. Had the accounting been in effect
in fiscal 2004, the Company would have reported  diluted net income per share of
approximately  $2.12 instead of $2.25,  including  the effect of the  settlement
charge.  The  likelihood  and  timing of  implementation  of the rule  change is
uncertain.  The Company  noted that,  if  implemented,  the change would have no
economic  effect because the terms of the notes would be unchanged.  The Company
has not yet determined what response or change in policy,  if any, it would make
if the new accounting took effect.
