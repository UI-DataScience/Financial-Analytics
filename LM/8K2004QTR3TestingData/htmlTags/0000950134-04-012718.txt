ITEM 2.02.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

         On August 18, 2004 the registrant issued a press release discussing its
results of operations and financial condition for its second fiscal quarter
ended July 31, 2004. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99
hereto.

         The registrant defines EBITDA as net income (loss) for the respective
periods excluding depreciation and amortization expense, interest income
(expense), and income taxes. The registrant's management views EBITDA as an
important alternative operating performance measure because it is commonly used
by analysts and institutional investors in analyzing the financial performance
of companies in the broadcast and television home shopping sectors. However,
EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or to cash
flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles) and should not be construed as a measure of
liquidity. EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly entitled
measures reported by other companies.

         The registrant's management uses EBITDA to evaluate operating
performance and as a measure of performance for incentive compensation purposes.

         For the quarter ended July 31, 2004, Exhibit 99 states that the net
loss for such quarter was $7.8 million. EBITDA for such quarter, which excludes
depreciation and amortization expense, interest income and income taxes, was
$(3.2) million. The difference between these measures includes $(4.9) million of
depreciation and amortization expense and $.3 million of interest income. For
the quarter ended July 31, 2003, Exhibit 99 states that net loss for such
quarter was $.1 million. EBITDA for such quarter, which excludes depreciation
and amortization expense, interest income and income taxes, was $3.9 million.
The difference between these measures includes $(4.3) million of depreciation
and amortization expense, $.4 million of interest income and $(.1) of income
taxes.

         For the six months ended July 31, 2004, Exhibit 99 states that the net
loss for such period was $15.7 million. EBITDA for such period, which excludes
depreciation and amortization expense, interest income and income taxes, was
$(6.6) million. The difference between these measures includes $(9.7) million of
depreciation and amortization expense and $.6 million of interest income. For
the six months ended July 31, 2003, Exhibit 99 states that net income for such
period was $.5 million. EBITDA for such period, which excludes depreciation and
amortization expense, interest income and income taxes, was $8.4 million. The
difference between these measures includes $(8.5) million of depreciation and
amortization expense, $.7 million of interest income and $(.1) of income taxes.

VALUEVISION REDESIGNS LOOK OF THE SHOPNBC TELEVISION NETWORK

On August 16, ValueVision launched a brand new look for ShopNBC. The new look
for the shopping network incorporates a state-of-the-art television
communication redesign with graphic and sound elements choreographed to present
product offers more clearly and effectively. This includes a higher level of
aesthetic appeal, such as a new tower, original music, a coming-up menu, catchy
promotional packages, and topical transition segments. As part of the redesign,
the Company launched a new tagline "Be Good To Yourself," which will be the
unifying theme across all customer touch points.

"The new look and tagline were designed to provide a much improved viewing
experience for our customers, to further differentiate ShopNBC from the
competition, and to strengthen the visual connection we have with our strategic
partner NBC," said Lansing.

COMPANY DEBUTS KEY MERCHANDISING INITIATIVE: "OUR TOP VALUE"

Coincident with the launch of ShopNBC's TV network redesign, ValueVision debuted
a key merchandising initiative called "Our Top Value" (OTV), a daily special
product offer at an exceptional value for one day only. OTV products are unique,
high quality, and timely. They have broad consumer appeal and are priced at
least 15% below ShopNBC's regular price and well below retail.

"The OTV strategy is one of many elements of our merchandising strategy," said
Lansing. "For our consumers, it's about unbelievable product at unbelievable
values. For vendors, it's a way for new ones to get in the door with us and
existing vendors to expand their relationship with us. Not only does OTV
complement our category diversification strategy, it should also drive
incremental sales and profit."

VALUEVISION RENEWS FULFILLMENT AND CUSTOMER SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH RALPH LAUREN
MEDIA

In the second quarter, ValueVision signed a two-year agreement with Ralph Lauren
Media to continue to provide fulfillment and customer care services. ValueVision
has a 12.5% ownership stake in the venture with NBC and Polo Ralph Lauren, and

During the second quarter, FanBuzz entered into e-commerce and fulfillment
agreements with the Chicago Bulls and the Washington Wizards. This marks the
third NBA franchise to sign with FanBuzz, including the Boston Celtics. FanBuzz
is a wholly owned subsidiary of ValueVision.

     slightly negative and the fourth quarter is expected to be positive.

(a)    EBITDA as defined for this statistical presentation represents net income
       (loss) for the respective periods excluding depreciation and amortization
       expense, interest income (expense) and income taxes. Previous to the
       second quarter of fiscal 2004, management defined EBITDA as operating
       income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization expense, other
       non-operating income (expense) and income taxes. The change was made to
       conform to the more common definition of EBITDA. Management views EBITDA
       as an important alternative operating performance measure because it is
       commonly used by analysts and institutional investors in analyzing the
       financial performance of companies in the broadcast and television home
       shopping sectors. However, EBITDA should not be construed as an
       alternative to operating income or to cash flows from operating
       activities (as determined in accordance with generally accepted
       accounting principles) and should not be construed as a measure of
       liquidity. EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly
       entitled measures reported by other companies. Management uses EBITDA to
       evaluate operating performance and as a measure of performance for
       incentive compensation purposes.
