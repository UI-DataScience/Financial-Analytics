(NASDAQ: LARL)\ntoday reported net income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 of $1.7\nmillion or $.85 per diluted share compared to net income of $2.5 million or\n$1.28 per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2003. The $847,000 or 33.4%\ndecrease in net income for the year reflects the effect of a decrease in net\ninterest income combined with higher operating expenses, partially offset by an\nincrease in other operating income and a decrease in income tax expense. The\nincrease in other operating income consisted primarily of income from the Bank's\ninvestment in Bank Owned Life Insurance and an increase in service fees\ncollected. The increase in operating expenses was primarily attributed to\nexpenses incurred from the operation of two additional branch offices and the\namortization of the core deposit intangible, which were both obtained as part of\nthe acquisition of SFSB Holding Company on March 28, 2003, increasing the number\nof full-service offices to eight.\n\n                                     (more)\n\n\n", u'\n\n\n\n\nFor fiscal 2004, the Company\'s return on average assets (ROA) was .55% and\nreturn on average stockholders\' equity was 6.19% compared to .89% and 9.32%,\nrespectively, for fiscal 2003.\n\nLaurel Capital Group, Inc. also reported net income for the quarter ended June\n30, 2004 of $431,000 or $.22 per diluted share compared to $556,000 or $.28 per\ndiluted share for the quarter ended June 30, 2003. The 22.5% decrease in net\nincome was primarily attributable to a decrease in net interest income, which\nwas partially offset by an increase in other income and a decrease in other\noperating and income tax expenses.\n\nNon-performing assets, which consist of loans delinquent 90 days and over,\nincreased $1.2 million to $2.2 million or .72% of total assets at June 30, 2004\ncompared to $956,000 or .30% of total assets at June 30, 2003. The increase in\nnon-performing loans was primarily due to three commercial loans having an\naverage balance of $239,000 and two single-family loans having an average\nbalance of $227,000 becoming non-performing. Management does not believe that\nthe current level of non-performing loans pose a material risk to the Company.\n\nIn commenting on the Company\'s performance, Edwin R. Maus, President and Chief\nExecutive Officer, stated that "The challenging interest rate and economic\nenvironment continues to inhibit the Company\'s operations and ability to\ngenerate earnings growth in a conservative manner. Notwithstanding these\nchallenges, we believe we are positioned to take advantage of changes in these\nenvironments as they occur."\n\nAt June 30, 2004, Laurel Capital Group, Inc. had total assets of $299.4 million,\nloans receivable, net of $173.3 million and total deposits of $246.2 million.\nAdditionally, stockholders\' equity amounted to $27.1 million or $14.06 per share\ncompared to $27.7 million or $14.71 per share at June 30, 2003.\n\nLaurel Capital Group, Inc., headquartered in Allison Park, PA, is the holding\ncompany for Laurel Savings Bank. Laurel Savings Bank is a 117-year-old,\nPennsylvania-chartered, FDIC-insured\n\n                                     (more)\n\n\n', u"\n\nsavings bank with eight full-service offices located in Allegheny and Butler\ncounties offering a wide variety of financial services and products to customers\nthroughout the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.\n\nThe Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission are available\nelectronically on the Internet and can be found at\nwww.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm.\n\nThis news release may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking\nstatements are subject to risk and uncertainties, which could cause actual\nresults to differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of\nfactors.
