("USAuto") for $76 million in cash that\n                  was raised in part by a rights offering to existing\n                  shareholders and the issuance of 13,250,000 shares to the\n                  shareholders of USAuto.\n\n         o        From the date of acquisition to June 30, 2004 (two months),\n                  the insurance operations produced revenues of $18.2 million\n                  and income before tax of $3.3 million, reporting a combined\n                  ratio of 74.8% (after adjusting expenses for ceding\n                  commissions from reinsurer and fee income) which included a\n                  loss ratio of 61.1% over the same period.\n\nACTUAL RESULTS\n\n         The net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2004 (which includes\ntwo months of insurance operations) was $6.1 million, or a net loss of $0.16 per\nshare on a fully-diluted basis, compared to a net loss of $0.8 million, or a net\nloss of $0.04 on a fully-diluted basis, for the same period of fiscal 2003.\nTotal revenues grew from $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 to $18.4\nmillion in the fourth quarter of 2004 as a result of the inclusion of USAuto\'s\nnon-standard automobile insurance operations. Total expenses for the 2004 period\ninclude $3.3 million of severance costs and $7.6 million in stock-based\ncompensation to terminated employees. Total weighted average diluted shares\nincreased from 20.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 to 38.2 million in the\nfourth quarter of 2004 as a result of the rights offering and USAuto\nacquisition.\n\n         The net loss for the year ended June 30, 2004 was $3.8 million, or a\nnet loss of $0.15 per share on a fully-diluted basis, compared to a net loss of\n$1.9 million, or a net loss of $0.09 on a fully-diluted basis, for fiscal 2003.\nTotal weighted average diluted shares increased from 20.4 million in fiscal 2003\nto 25.0 million in fiscal 2004 as a result of the rights offering and USAuto\nacquisition.\n\nPRO FORMA RESULTS\n\n         On a pro forma basis, for the year ended June 30, 2004 (assuming that\nthe acquisition of USAuto took place on July 1, 2002), total revenues were\n$100.3 million, compared to $80.4 million for fiscal 2003. On a pro forma basis,\nnet income increased 27%, from $9.1 million in fiscal 2003 to $11.6 million in\nfiscal 2004, and, on a fully-diluted basis, net income per share increased 26%,\nfrom $0.19 in fiscal 2003 to $0.24 in fiscal 2004.\n\n', u"\n\nINSURANCE OPERATIONS\n\n         o        KEY RATIOS - The Company's loss ratio was 61.1% for the period\n                  from April 30, 2004 (the date of the USAuto acquisition) to\n                  June 30, 2004. On a pro forma basis, for the year ended June\n                  30, 2004, the Company's loss ratio improved to 63.4% from\n                  67.5% for fiscal 2003 and the combined ratio improved to 79.2%\n                  from 80.6% over the same period.\n\n         o        OFFICE EXPANSION - During the three months ended June 30,\n                  2004, the Company opened 13 new offices in four states,\n                  bringing the total number to 139 offices in seven states. This\n                  increase compares to two new offices opened during the same\n                  period last year. During the year ended June 30, 2004, the\n                  Company opened 30 new offices compared to 17 during the same\n                  period last year, and 13 during the same period in 2002. The\n                  30 new offices opened in fiscal 2004 were profit neutral in\n                  fiscal 2004, but are expected to be accretive during fiscal\n                  2005. Between June 30, 2004 and August 31, 2004, the Company\n                  opened an additional seven offices, bringing the total number\n                  of offices to 146.\n\n         o        PREMIUM GROWTH - On a pro forma basis, for the three months\n                  ended June 30, 2004, net premiums earned increased by 43% to\n                  $17.5 million, as compared to $12.2 million for the same\n                  period last year. The increase was driven by an increase in\n                  the percentage of reinsurance assumed on business written in\n                  Alabama (increased from 15% to 50% effective February 2004) in\n                  addition to a 6% increase in the number of average policies in\n                  force.\n\n                  On a pro forma basis, for the year ended June 30, 2004, net\n                  premiums earned increased by 50% to $57.7 million, as compared\n                  to $38.4 million for fiscal 2003. The increase was due to the\n                  previous-mentioned increase in the percentage of reinsurance\n                  assumed on business written in Alabama and a 5% increase in\n                  average policies in force.\n\n         o        REINSURANCE - During the quarter and year ended June 30, 2004,\n                  the Company ceded approximately 50% of its earned premiums.\n                  Based on the increase in available statutory capital and\n                  surplus as a result of the USAuto acquisition, the Company\n                  elected not to renew its quota share reinsurance treaty\n                  effective September 1, 2004. For the year ended June 30, 2004,\n                  ceded premiums earned by the reinsurer were $44.4 million.\n\nREAL ESTATE OPERATIONS\n\n         During the three months ended June 30, 2004, the Company sold one\nproperty of 1.3 acres in San Antonio, Texas for net sales proceeds of $26,000,\nwhich was equal to its carrying value. For the year ended June 30, 2004, a total\nof ten properties, totaling $4.6 million in sales proceeds, were sold, producing\na gain of $4.1 million.\n\n                                       2\n\n", u'\n\n\n         On July 7, 2004, the property and deed for 41 acres the Company owned\nin Arlington, Texas was taken by the City of Arlington upon foreclosure of a tax\nlien with no recourse to the Company. An accrual of $433,000 for potential\nliability for taxes will be reversed in the first fiscal quarter of 2005.\n\n         The Company has six parcels of land remaining to be sold in the San\nAntonio area, totaling 310 acres, with a book value of $1.1 million at June 30,\n2004.\n\nCASH AND INVESTED ASSETS\n\n         The Company completed a rights offering of its common stock on April\n30, 2004, which produced net proceeds of approximately $49.4 million. Prior to\nthe transaction, the Company had unrestricted cash totaling $58.9 million,\nresulting in total cash available for the USAuto acquisition of $108.3 million.\nOf this amount, $76.0 million was paid for the purchase of USAuto, $2.9 million\nwas used to reduce USAuto\'s debt, and $3.1 million was paid for costs related to\nthe acquisition. After the acquisition, the Company contributed $5.0 million to\nthe statutory capital and surplus of its two insurance subsidiaries, USAuto\nInsurance Company Inc. and Village Auto Insurance Company Inc., to support\nadditional premium writings. The remaining net unrestricted cash of $21.3\nmillion is available for general corporate purposes and to provide support for\nincreased premium writings of the insurance operations.\n\n         Proceeds from the Company\'s rights offering and cash flows from\ninsurance operations for the two months ended June 30, 2004 have contributed to\nhigher invested assets. On July 1, 2004, the Company engaged Hyperion Capital\nManagement, Inc. to manage its insurance and corporate investment portfolios,\nwhich total approximately $60 million in investable assets.\n\nABOUT FIRST ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION\n\n         First Acceptance Corporation began its operations as Liberte Investors,\nInc. in 1986.
