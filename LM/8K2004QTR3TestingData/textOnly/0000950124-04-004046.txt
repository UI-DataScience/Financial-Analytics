REPORTS\n                    2004 SECOND-QUARTER AND SIX-MONTH RESULTS\n\nROCHESTER HILLS, MICHIGAN -- AUGUST 16, 2004 - TRANS-INDUSTRIES, INC. (NASDAQ:\nTRNI), a manufacturer of bus lighting systems and information display products,\nannounced results for the second quarter and six months ending June 30, 2004.\n\nSales were $7.7 million for the quarter. This represented a decline of 9.9\npercent from sales of $8.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003.\nThis decline was concentrated in the lighting products business segment and\nresulted primarily from a decrease in the level of bus production from that of\nthe previous year. Moreover, in the current quarter, the Company shipped a\nlimited number of luggage lofts, which have higher dollar content per bus than\nregular lighting products. While sales of digital information products improved,\nsuch sales were insufficient to offset the decrease in lighting shipments noted\nabove. These same factors resulted in a sales decrease of $2.0 million, or 11.4\npercent, to $15.2 million for the current period from $17.2 million for the\nsix-month period ended June 30, 2003.\n\nA loss of $2.6 million was incurred for the quarter, consisting of $344,000 from\noperations in addition to $2.3 million from the establishment of an additional\ninventory reserve. This inventory reserve resulted from several factors that\nimpacted the Company's operations during the quarter. In early March, management\nchanges were effected including the appointment of a new President and Chief\nOperating Officer. The Company's existing product offerings were analyzed and\nsome have been curtailed, and personnel has been further reduced, thereby\nreducing product absorption. In light of a decline in sales during the second\nquarter and the changed business direction, it was determined a portion of the\ninventory would not be used going forward. Cost reduction opportunities\ncontinued to be emphasized with formal programs initiated in all cost segments.\n\n", u'\n\n\n\n\nHowever, savings from these programs are not expected to be realized in full\nuntil later in the year as legacy costs in the form of severance payments\ncontinued throughout the quarter.\n\nThe Company believes its system for purchasing materials, particularly in the\ndigital information systems operation, improved in the period as better\nutilization of the material requirements production system initiated last year\nprovided needed information for enhanced scheduling against available inventory.\n\nThe Company has been operating under a forbearance agreement with Comerica Bank,\nits present lender until January 2005. Efforts to locate another lender to\nreplace the Comerica credit have been ongoing and the Company anticipates\nfinalizing credit arrangements with a new lender by September 1, 2004.\n\nABOUT THE COMPANY:\nThe Company is a leading provider of lighting systems and related components to\nthe mass transit market as well as a supplier of information hardware and\nsoftware solutions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and mass transit\nprojects. ITS utilizes integrated networks of electronic sensors, signs and\nsoftware to monitor road conditions, communicate information to drivers and help\ntransportation authorities better manage traffic flow across their existing\ninfrastructures.\n\nForward-Looking Statements:\nExcept for statements of historical fact, this news release contains certain\nforward-looking statements about the Company.
