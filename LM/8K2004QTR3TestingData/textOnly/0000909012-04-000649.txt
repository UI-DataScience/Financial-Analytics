(Nasdaq: SCLD), today\nannounced financial results for its 2004 fiscal third quarter, which ended July\n31, 2004. Revenues for the quarter were $6,600,296 compared to $8,156,414\nmillion in fiscal third quarter 2003. Revenues increased by $808,532 compared to\nfiscal second quarter 2004. The Company recorded a net third quarter loss of\n$1,076,927 compared to net earnings of $10,308 in the previous fiscal year third\nquarter. Net loss per share was $.08 in fiscal third quarter 2004 compared to\nearnings of $.01 per share in the previous fiscal year third quarter.\n\n"Although Q3 revenues were up modestly from Q2, our fiscal year-to-date results\nare disappointing," said Thomas P. Dunne, SteelCloud Chairman and CEO. "Third\nquarter gross profits were adversely affected by new contract start-up costs. On\nthe positive side, however, recent fourth quarter order activity has increased\nour working backlog by 50% - from $14 million at the beginning of the quarter to\n$21 million - not including additional contract options for six million dollars,\nwhich will bring total backlog to $27 million. New order activity has been\ndriven by several factors... economic turnaround, innovative engineering and\nrecent ISO 9001 certification. Starting in the fourth quarter the company will\nexperience growth in revenues, margins, and profitability. I am optimistic about\nour current business model and future prospects."\n\n\n\n\n', u'\n\n\nFiscal Year 2004, Q3 highlights:\n\n|X|   SteelCloud ended FY Q3 with over $14 million in backlog.\n\n|X|   The Company ended the quarter with just under $10 million in working\n      capital and approximately $6,363,433 in cash.\n\n|X|  Microsoft successfully deployed twenty-three of their thirty-three\n     SteelCloud IDS appliances in their Security Network Operations Center at\n     Microsoft\'s Worldwide Partner Conference in Toronto, Canada on July 11-13.\n|X|  Steelcloud continued R&D investments in its proprietary software at the\n     Company\'s Fort Lauderdale, Florida facility. |X| Steelcloud announced,\n     demonstrated and made first customer deliveries of the Company\'s new Secure\n     Content Manager Security Platform.\n\nAs previously announced, the Company will also hold a telephone conference call\nat 11:00 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, September 14, 2004 to discuss the release.
