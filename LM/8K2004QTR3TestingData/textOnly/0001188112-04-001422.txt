Same-store sales increased 10.1%, versus last year\'s\n13.7% gain.\n\nDuring the third quarter, the Company\'s sales result was better than anticipated\nprimarily due to strong sales of emergency response items, particularly in the\nSoutheast region, as well as a higher level of promotional activity compared to\nthe year ago period. However, the Company\'s gross margin was negatively impacted\nby several factors including:\n\n     -    Sales of lower margin hurricane related products.\n\n     -    Higher year-over-year levels of promotional activity.\n\n     -    A later than expected start to the Fall/Winter selling season, which\n          negatively impacted the sale of higher margin seasonal products.\n\n     -    Greater than anticipated freight costs coupled with difficulty passing\n          through steel and other commodity costs to consumers.\n\n     -    A higher LIFO reserve due to increased product costs.\n\nIn addition, selling, general and administrative expenses were higher primarily\ndue to reset activity, uninsured losses and increased legal and accounting\nexpenses.\n\nWhile the process of evaluating inventories and operating costs is not yet\ncomplete, the Company currently anticipates net income, excluding an estimated\n$1.9 million after-tax charge related to the consolidation and relocation of the\nCompany\'s store support center, to be between $8.5 and $9.5 million, or $0.20 to\n$0.23 per diluted share. This compares to the Company\'s previous expectation for\nnet income, excluding the above referenced charge, of $11.0 to $12.4 million, or\n$0.26 to $0.29 per diluted share.\n\nIncluding the aforementioned charge, net income is anticipated to be in the\nrange of $6.6 to $7.6 million, or $0.16 to $0.18 per diluted share, for the\nthird quarter. This compares to the Company\'s previous guidance, including the\ncharge, of $9.0 to $10.4 million, or $0.21 to $0.24 per diluted share, for the\nthird quarter.\n\nJoe Scarlett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated, "We have not fully\nassessed the potential impact of the above conditions on our fourth quarter\nsales, margin and profits. However, we have now completed the significant third\nquarter reset activity and we are taking steps to improve our margins. For\nexample, next week, as part of our annual vendor conference, we will be holding\na series of meetings titled "Working Collaboratively to Reduce Supply Chain\nCosts." We continue to believe we are well positioned to continue to drive\nlong-term growth and deliver shareholder value."\n\n', u"\n\nThe Company plans to release its full third quarter results as well as provide\nan update of expectations for fiscal 2004 after the market closes on Monday,\nOctober 11, 2004.\n\nTractor Supply Company operates 500 stores in 32 states, focused on supplying\nthe lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers.
