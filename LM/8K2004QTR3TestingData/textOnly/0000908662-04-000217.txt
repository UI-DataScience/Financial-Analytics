Bruce Turner.  "Total revenues\ngrew  approximately  17  percent,  quarter-over-quarter,   driven  by  continued\nimprovements in same-store sales, the benefit of recent acquisitions, and strong\nproduct sales. In addition to a solid financial performance, we had a successful\nquarter across all three GTECH vertical markets - lottery, gaming solutions, and\ncommercial services."\n\n"We are  pleased  with  the  continued  strength  of our core  business  and the\nprogress we have made in integrating our recent acquisitions," said GTECH Senior\nVice  President and Chief  Financial  Officer  Jaymin B. Patel.  "We are excited\nabout the  opportunities  we see in each of the markets we serve, and based upon\nour current outlook, we are confident we can achieve our goals and objectives in\nthe current fiscal year and beyond."\n\n\nOperating Results\n- -----------------\n\nEarnings  and  dividends  per share for the three and six month  periods  of the\nprior year have been restated to reflect the 2-for-1 common stock split effected\nin the form of a stock  dividend,  which was  distributed  on July 30, 2004,  to\nshareholders of record as of July 1, 2004.\n\nRevenues  for the second  quarter of fiscal 2005 were $323.5  million,  up 16.7%\nover revenues of $277.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Net income\nwas $53.1 million,  or $0.40 per diluted share, up 9.5% over net income of $48.5\nmillion, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the same period last year.\n\nRevenues for the first six months of fiscal 2005 were $603.7  million,  up 16.8%\nover  revenues  of $516.8  million in the first six months of fiscal  2004.  Net\nincome was $106.7 million,  or $0.80 per diluted share, up 19.2% over net income\nof $89.5 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, for the same period last year. Net\nincome  in the  first  six  months of  fiscal  2005  includes  a net,  one-time,\nafter-tax  gain of $6.4  million,  or  approximately  $0.05 per  diluted  share,\nassociated  with the sale of the Company\'s 50% interest in Gaming  Entertainment\n(Delaware)  L.L.C.,  net of charges  associated with the early retirement of the\nremainder of the Company\'s 2007 private placement notes.\n\n\nCash Flow and Investments\n- -------------------------\n\nDuring the first six months of fiscal 2005, the Company generated $171.8 million\nof cash from  operations  which,  along with other  sources  of  liquidity,  was\nprincipally  used to fund the  Spielo  Manufacturing  Incorporated  and  Leeward\nIslands Lottery Holding  Company,  Inc.  acquisitions of $192.4 million,  and to\npurchase  systems,  equipment  and other assets  relating to contracts of $113.0\nmillion.  In addition,  the Company  repaid the  remaining  $90.0 million of its\n7.87% Senior Notes;  repurchased  $82.8  million,  or 3,649,500  shares,  of the\nCompany\'s common stock; and paid cash dividends of $20.1 million.\n\nAt the end of the  fiscal  2005  second  quarter,  GTECH  had $15.0  million  of\nborrowings under its $300 million credit facility.\n\n\nFinancial Outlook\n- -----------------\n\nThe  Company  provided  guidance  for the full year and third  quarter of fiscal\n2005.\n\nFor the fiscal year ending  February 26, 2005,  GTECH  expects  service  revenue\ngrowth in the range of 5% to 7%, and product  sales in the range of $210 million\nto $220 million.\n\nThe Company continues to expect service profit margins to be in the range of 40%\nto 42%, and product sale profit margins to be in the range of 36% to 38%.\n\nThe  Company  expects  the  effective  tax rate for the fiscal year to be in the\nrange of 35% to 36%,  compared  to 37%  reported in the first half of the fiscal\nyear. It expects the most  significant  portion of the rate  reduction will take\naffect in the third quarter.\n\nBased upon the  results of the first  half of the  fiscal  year and the  current\noutlook,  it continues to expect earnings per share for fiscal 2005 to be in the\nrange of $1.43 to $1.48 on a  fully-diluted  basis,  reflecting the  two-for-one\nstock split that occurred on July 30, 2004.\n\nFor the third  quarter of fiscal 2005,  ending  November  27, 2004,  the Company\nexpects  service  revenue  growth in the range of 6% to 8%, and product sales in\nthe range of $55 million to $65 million.  The Company expects service margins in\nthe range of 38% to 40%,  and  product  margins  in the range of 37% to 39%.  It\nexpects  the  effective  tax  rate  for the  quarter  to be  approximately  33%.\nAccordingly,  the Company expects earnings per share to be in the range of $0.33\nto $0.36 per share for the quarter.  This  compares  with $0.35  reported in the\nsame period last year,  which included a one-time,  after-tax,  non-cash gain of\n$3.3 million,  or $0.03 per diluted share,  associated with the consolidation of\nthe partnership that owns the Company\'s headquarters facility in Rhode Island.\n\n\nSecond Quarter Highlights\n- -------------------------\n\nIn the second quarter,  GTECH  continued to strengthen its market  leadership in\nthe core lottery  business.  Internationally,  the Company was chosen to provide\n5,000 additional  handheld lottery terminals to Organizacion  Nacional de Ciegos\nEspanoles  (ONCE)  in  Spain,  following  a  previous  order of  7,000  handheld\nterminals  also  awarded to GTECH by ONCE in the second  quarter.  In  addition,\nCogetech,  a joint  venture  in  which  GTECH  is the  technology  and  services\nprovider,  was named a successful applicant for a five-year license to operate a\ngaming machine  network and central  system in Italy.  The Company also signed a\nlong-term  integrated  services  contract  to provide a complete  video  lottery\nsolution in Jamaica. In Mexico, GTECH\'s original contract award with Pronosticos\npara la  Asistencia  Publica  was  reinstated  in August,  and the new  six-year\nintegrated  services  contract  was  ultimately  signed by both parties in early\nSeptember 2004.\n\nDomestically,  GTECH  signed a three-year  contract  extension in Oregon and was\nawarded a new Instant Ticket Vending Machine (ITVM) contract in Maine.\n\nOn the  commercial  services  side,  GTECH began  selling  prepaid  mobile phone\ntop-ups through its 200 lottery  terminals in Barbados in June 2004. The Company\nalso launched bill payment  services at approximately  700 terminals  throughout\nPoland utilizing the PolCard network.\n\nAlso in the quarter, GTECH unveiled GamePoint(TM),  the Company\'s new all-in-one\ninstant and online lottery terminal solution.  The innovative GamePoint terminal\ndispenses  both  instant and online  tickets,  combining  GTECH\'s  world-leading\nonline expertise and Interlott\'s instant ticket self-service leadership.\n\n"In total, we secured between $220 million and $240 million in total incremental\nfuture revenues this last quarter," continued Mr. Turner.\n\nAfter the close of the quarter,  GTECH signed a  three-year  contract  extension\nwith the Minnesota  State Lottery to commence on February 10, 2008. In addition,\nto advance its commercial  services strategy,  the Company recently announced it\nhad acquired  BillBird  S.A.,  the leading  provider of electronic  bill payment\nservices in Poland.\n\n\nOther Business Developments\n- ---------------------------\n\nSri Lanka\n- ---------\n\nGTECH\'s customer in Sri Lanka, the Mahapola Higher Education  Scholarship  Trust\nFund  (MTF),  was  recently  notified  by the  Supreme  Court of the  Democratic\nSocialist  Republic of Sri Lanka that it may resume with the  implementation  of\nits  lottery  games  in the  country.  In March  2004,  lawsuits  were  filed by\ncompetitors   challenging   GTECH\'s   contract   award  and  thus   delayed  the\nimplementation  of the instant  ticket and online  games in Sri Lanka.  All such\nlawsuits  have  been  settled,  without  any  payment  by  GTECH,  and have been\ndismissed.\n\nCertain  statements   contained  in  this  press  release  are  forward  looking\nstatements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the  Securities Act of 1933 and\nSection 21E of the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934.

     Final - 20 September 2004\n\n\nHello,  everyone  ... and welcome to our  discussion  of GTECH's  second-quarter\nresults.\n\n\nSlide #4\n- --------\n\nAs you have seen in this  morning's  release,  it was another  quarter of steady\ngrowth  and  profitability  for GTECH  despite  the  challenges  in  Brazil  and\ndifficult quarter-over-quarter comparisons.\n\nTotal revenues grew  approximately 17 percent,  quarter over quarter,  driven by\ncontinued improvements in same store sales and strong product sales.\n\nGross profit margins were within the expected range at 41 percent ... despite an\nincrease in depreciation...\n\nOur operating  expense  ratio was 13 percent,  down a point and a half from last\nquarter ...\n\nEarnings per share came in at 40 cents per share ...  which was slightly  higher\nthan expected ...\n\nWe recorded $75 million in cash from operations.\n\nAnd we have been able to maintain one of the highest returns on invested capital\nin the gaming  industry,  despite a significant  increase in the average capital\nemployed in the business.\n\nIn addition to a solid financial performance, we had a successful quarter across\nall three GTECH vertical  markets:  lottery,  gaming  solutions,  and commercial\nservices.\n\nAmong the lottery  highlights  were two new orders for handheld  terminals  from\nONCE, the Spanish National Organization for the Blind. With these orders - for a\ntotal of 12 thousand  additional  terminals - the ONCE network will total 19,000\nunits,  making  it the  largest  lottery  network  in  Spain.  Clearly,  Spain's\nvisually-impaired retailers are very pleased with the terminals' ease of use and\nperformance.\n\nThe second  quarter also saw the situation in Mexico  resolved in GTECH's favor.\nAs you may recall, GTECH's winning bid to supply a new online lottery system and\nnetwork to our customer  ---Pronosticos --- was declared non-compliant in April.\nHowever,  after an  appeal,  the  Mexican  Comptroller  Ministry  reversed  that\ndecision  last month ... and we have  recently  signed a new  six-year  contract\nvalued at approximately $90 million dollars.\n\nIn August, we signed a three-year  contract  extension worth up to approximately\n$25 million dollars with the Oregon Lottery. The deal calls for GTECH to replace\nOregon's  existing video lottery central system with our Enterprise Series Video\nsystem. We will also be providing 2,000  internet-protocol - or IP--ready Altura\nsite  controllers,  which will link more than 10,000 VLTs to the central system.\nThis new  contract  will take effect in 2005,  marking  Oregon's  20th year as a\nvalued GTECH customer.\n\nOn the opposite  side of the country,  we recently  secured a contract  with the\nstate of Maine. Under the terms of the contract,  we will be supplying the Maine\nLottery with 150 Instant Ticket Vending Machines. This is our fourth consecutive\nITVM  contract win and serves as further  validation of how the  acquisition  of\nInterlott has enhanced GTECH's ability to pursue and win new business.  In fact,\nwe have  been so  successful  in the  ITVM  space  since  the  acquisition  that\nInterlott's production hit an all-time high in the month of July.\n\nThere was good news in our Gaming Solutions  business,  as well ... with a video\ncentral system win in Italy through our joint venture,  Cogetech ... and a total\nVLT system win in Jamaica.\n\nThe contract  with Italy is  significant  because,  although the Italian  gaming\nmarket  ranks eighth in the world in terms of total  gaming  sales,  much of its\nlegalized gaming machine market remains  untapped.  Up to 65,000 gaming machines\nwill be deployed throughout Italy and connected to our Enterprise Series central\nsystem.  The  Jamaican  VLT  contract  is the  second  one for which  GTECH is a\nsingle-source vendor, providing all components. Initially, we will install about\n125 video lottery  terminals,  with an option to expand from there. We expect to\ngenerate  up to $60  million  dollars  in  revenues  from  the  contract  by its\nconclusion in 2011.\n\nAll told,  we secured  between $220  million and $240  million  dollars in total\nincremental future revenues this last quarter.\n\nIn the  Commercial  Services  vertical,  we  continued  to expand  our  services\nsuccessfully  in Latin America and Poland.  In June,  we began selling  pre-paid\nmobile phone top-ups through our lottery terminals in Barbados. We also launched\nbill payment services at approximately 700 terminals throughout Poland utilizing\nthe  PolCard  network.  And two weeks ago,  we  acquired  BillBird,  the leading\nprovider  of  electronic  bill  payments  in Poland,  with over 2,000  points of\naccess.  GTECH is now the leader in this emerging  industry in Poland ... and we\nare well positioned to become a commercial  services market leader in one of the\nmost significant markets in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\n\nSlide #5\n- --------\n\nWhen we look at the factors  that fueled our lottery  performance  in the second\nquarter,  new games  continued  to be a key  driver.  In late May,  we  launched\nHotTrax,  a new  monitor-based  lottery game, at select  locations here in Rhode\nIsland.  Since the launch,  we have seen total  sales of monitor  games at these\nlocations increase by an average of 24%.\n\nEncouraged by this performance,  we are currently  developing a suite of monitor\ngames tied to popular  spectator sports that will add further  excitement to the\nsocial space play experience.\n\nAt the same time, we are moving  forward  aggressively  to enhance our e-scratch\nofferings. Starting this quarter and continuing for the next year or so, we will\nintroduce  four new  e-scratch  games every  quarter.  The games  scheduled  for\nrelease in  October  include a  sports-themed  game ... a  Halloween  game ... a\ncasino  style  3-reel game that will allow for  multiple  line matches and bonus\nrounds  ... and a  crossword-style  game.  We believe  that these will add a new\nelement of revenue-stimulating excitement and anticipation for players.\n\nWe also continue to develop ways to generate new revenue  through branded games,\ninstant-online games such as Extra and Bingo, and promotional on-line games tied\nto major  events.  Earlier  this year,  we announced an agreement to develop and\ndistribute  lottery games based on Hasbro's  Monopoly and Battleship  games.  We\nplan to release our first Monopoly-themed games into the traditional on-line and\non-line instant markets in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. Very soon, we\nhope to be  announcing  another  branded  monitor  game to  complement  Keno and\nHotTrax ... and we will bring you all the details as soon as they are available.\n\nWe have also  invested  in game  development  at Spielo  since  closing  on that\nacquisition  in late April and we plan to release  three new video lottery games\nin the New York market by the end of this  calendar  year.  The first release is\nscheduled for installation this week.\n\nIn  addition  to  developing  new  games  for New York,  we are  developing  new\nmulti-line video games for the wide-area, racino and casino marketplaces. We are\nalso pursuing licensing  agreements with third-party  content developers ... and\nwe are  exploring  ways to  license  Spielo  content  in Class II and  Class III\nmarkets.  As I have said  before,  it is our goal to become  the  number-one  or\nnumber-two player in the markets in which we operate,  and we believe increasing\nour investment in content development will help us attain that goal.\n\nConvenience and self-service  are also important  factors in driving new lottery\nsales. To that end, we recently introduced GamePoint,  an all-in-one instant and\nonline lottery  self-service  terminal  solution.  GamePoint extends the product\nvalue inherent in Interlott's  instant  ticket vending by  incorporating  online\nfunctionality and end-to-end connectivity. This product will allow us to upgrade\nthe existing 30,000 instant ticket vending machines in the marketplace today ...\nas well as  helping  us  expand  into new  markets.  We plan to ship  the  first\nGamePoint  machines to  Washington  in the  beginning  of 2005.  If the positive\nindustry  response we have received thus far is any  indication,  GamePoint will\nhelp accelerate the already-fast growth in the ITVM/self-service space.\n\nIn addition to these developments, we are pursuing a number of new opportunities\nin Lottery  and Gaming  Solutions.  We are  currently  waiting for a decision in\nThailand,  where we have bid on a new on-line  lottery system as part of a joint\nventure with Loxley, a Thai  conglomerate.  We were one of only two companies to\nmake the short list after  technical  evaluations ... and a final decision could\nbe made within a matter of weeks.\n\nWe have also recently rebid for our lottery contract in Missouri,  and we expect\na decision from them some time in the third quarter.\n\nIn  Pennsylvania,  where  the state  government  recently  approved  legislation\nallowing  video lottery  terminals at race tracks,  we have submitted a bid on a\nVLT central system contract and we plan to pursue machine opportunities there as\nwell. We also have proposals  pending for video central  systems in Manitoba and\nthe Atlantic  Lottery  Corporation  in Canada ... and we are looking at upcoming\nVLT opportunities in Louisiana and Maine.\n\nMeanwhile,  we are  actively  pursuing  new  lottery  opportunities  in Finland,\nGermany and New Zealand... a new multi-channel interactive gaming opportunity in\nIreland ... and several government  licensing  opportunities,  including on-line\nsystems for hunting and fishing permits in Illinois and Kansas.\n\nCloser to home,  the Rhode  Island  Supreme  Court  recently  ruled the proposed\nlegislation allowing for a casino in West Warwick to be unconstitutional. On the\nheels of this news,  we expect the owners of Lincoln Park and Newport  Grand Jai\nAlai to pursue their plans to expand their lottery-run VLT operations. Under the\nterms of our Master Agreement with the state of Rhode Island, GTECH will provide\nthe next 700 machines installed, plus 50% of any additional machines.\n\nOn the  operational  side of things,  the  integration  of our  acquisitions  is\nproceeding  according  to  plan  and we are  beginning  to see  the  inter-group\nbenefits  of  Spielo  and  LILHCo,   particularly  between  lottery  and  gaming\nsolutions.\n\nNow,  before I turn  things  over to  Jaymin,  I would  like to give you a brief\nupdate on the  situation in Brazil ... and the latest on our capital  allocation\nprogram.\n\nWhen last we  spoke,  a court in  Brazil  had  decided  to  withhold  30% of our\nrevenues  pending the outcome of a civil suit  against  GTECH.  We appealed  the\ncourt's decision ... and that appeal is still pending.  In the meantime,  we are\ncontinuing  to work with our  customer  in Brazil to find a  solution  that will\nallow us to remain in the country.\n\nIn fact,  I recently  met with  members of Caixa to discuss  their plans for the\nfuture and to reiterate our desire to find a solution that allows us to continue\nour partnership.  However,  I want to assure you that the outcome of the current\nsituation  -  whichever  way it goes - will not have an  impact  on  either  our\nlong-term  strategy  ...  or our  long-term  outlook.  Since we first  announced\ndevelopments  in Brazil,  we have announced 14 new contracts and extensions with\ncustomers around the globe and we have seen no disruption to our business.\n\nAs our recent announcement  regarding the acquisition of BillBird indicates,  we\ncontinue to identify and evaluate  acquisition  candidates  that we believe will\ndrive long term growth and  shareholder  value.  We continue to believe it is an\nopportunity-rich environment.\n\n\nSlide #6\n- --------\n\nFinally,  in  keeping  with our  long-standing  commitment  to  return  value to\nshareholders,  we returned approximately $65 million dollars to our shareholders\nin  the  second  quarter.  This  included  our  regular  quarterly  dividend  of\napproximately  $10  million  dollars in July.  We also  repurchased  2.6 million\nshares of GTECH  stock in the  quarter at a cost of  approximately  $55  million\ndollars. As of today, we have 115.7 million shares outstanding and approximately\n$10 million dollars remaining under the current repurchase  program. We continue\nto believe that GTECH stock  represents  a good  investment  opportunity  at the\ncurrent trading levels.\n\nAll told, on a  year-to-date  basis,  we have returned in excess of $100 million\ndollars to our shareholders through the dividend and share repurchase programs.\n\nAnd with that,  I would  like to turn the  proceedings  over to our CFO,  Jaymin\nPatel.\n\nJaymin: Thank you Bruce.  Good morning, everyone.\n\n\nSlide #7\n- --------\n\nI would like to start by reviewing GTECH's  second-quarter  performance.  We are\ncertainly  pleased  with  the  performance  of  the  business  in the  light  of\nchallenges we faced in Brazil and  difficult  quarter-over  quarter  comparisons\ncreated by  significant  jackpot  activity in the second  quarter of last fiscal\nyear combined with the impact of increased capital deployed in the business over\nthe last twelve months.\n\nI would  like to remind  everyone  that all  references  to  earnings  per share\nreflect the two-for-one (2-for-1) stock split, that occurred on July 30th.\n\nSecond quarter service  revenues  increased more than ten million dollars ($10M)\nor approximately four percent (4%), driven by a number of factors.\n\nA  closer  review  of the  underlying  dynamics  of the  business  will  help to\nillustrate  what those key  drivers  were.  Let's start with a review of lottery\nservice  revenues.  In the U.S.,  same store sales increased  approximately  six\npercent  (6%),  with the  majority  of our  domestic  jurisdictions  once  again\nenjoying improved sales.\n\nThis increase in same store sales continues to be driven by the  introduction of\nnew games,  modifications to existing games,  such as jackpot  changes,  and the\nmarketing efforts of our customers. We also benefited from the launch of our new\nservice contract in Tennessee and the impact of the Interlott acquisition.\n\nThe increase in lottery  service  revenues was partially  offset by  contractual\nrate  changes,  resulting  in  domestic  service  revenues  of one  hundred  and\ntwenty-nine  million dollars ($129M), up approximately two percent (2%) over the\nsecond quarter of last fiscal year.\n\nInternational same store lottery sales grew by approximately two percent (2%) on\na constant currency basis,  reflecting new games such as Big Lotto in Taiwan, as\nwell as expanded distribution channels, including Keno in Beijing.\nFactoring  in higher  jackpot  activity  and the  favorable  impact  of  foreign\nexchange rates,  offset by contractual rate changes and the thirty percent (30%)\nwithholding  of our  revenues  in  Brazil,  our  international  lottery  service\nrevenues  increased by  approximately  four percent (4%), to ninety-one  million\ndollars ($91M).\n\nTotal service  revenues  included  approximately  eight million dollars ($8M) of\nservice revenue from gaming  solutions,  up  approximately  four million dollars\n($4M) over the same  period  last year.  This was driven by the  addition of new\nvideo lottery terminals in Rhode Island and the acquisition of Spielo.\n\nWe also  recorded  approximately  nineteen  million  dollars  ($19M) of  service\nrevenue from  commercial  transaction  processing,  which was  comparable to the\nsecond quarter of last fiscal year. Whilst we experienced an approximate  eleven\npercent (11%) increase in same store sales quarter over quarter,  this was again\noffset by the thirty percent (30%) withholding of revenues in Brazil.\n\n\nSlide #8\n- --------\n\nProduct sales in the second quarter were  seventy-five  million  dollars ($75M),\ndriven by terminal sales to our customer in Belgium combined with the first of 3\nterminal shipments to ONCE in Spain.\n\nGross profit  increased  by  approximately  sixteen  million  dollars  ($16M) or\nthirteen  percent  (13%)  quarter-over-quarter.  Service  gross profit  declined\napproximately six million dollars ($6M) quarter-over-quarter. This was primarily\nthe result of higher depreciation and amortization and the impact of the revenue\nwithholding in Brazil.\n\nProduct margins were stronger than anticipated, at forty-one point eight percent\n(41.8%), due to changes in the product mix.\n\nOur operating expenses for the quarter were forty-two point five million dollars\n($42.5M), or approximately thirteen percent (13%) of total revenue.\n\nThe two point eight million dollar ($2.8M) increase in SG&A was driven primarily\nby the  consolidation of acquisitions  and increased  activities in new business\ndevelopment.\n\nThis was partially offset by lower research and development expenses,  primarily\ndue to the timing of development initiatives.\n\nThe strength in revenues drove operating income growth of approximately fourteen\nmillion dollars ($14M) or nineteen percent (19%).\n\nBelow the operating income line,  other expense  increased  approximately  seven\nmillion  dollars  ($7M),  driven  by lower  equity  income  from  unconsolidated\naffiliates as a result of the sale of our equity interest in Harrington  Raceway\nin  Delaware,  combined  with higher  interest  expense  resulting  from the two\nhundred and fifty million dollars ($250M) of debt issued in the third quarter of\nlast fiscal year.\n\nNet income for the quarter increased approximately five million dollars ($5M) or\napproximately  ten percent (10%) and we reported  diluted  earnings per share of\nforty cents ($0.40), up approximately eight percent (8%) over the second quarter\nof last fiscal year.\n\n\nSlide #9\n- --------\n\nDuring the quarter,  we generated  seventy-five  million  dollars ($75M) in cash\nflows from operations.\n\nThis financed  approximately  sixty-three  million  dollars  ($63M) in investing\nactivities.\n\nAlso in the quarter,  we repurchased  approximately two point six million shares\n(2.6M) of GTECH stock at a cost of fifty-five million dollars ($55M) and we made\nour  quarterly  dividend  payment in the  amount of  approximately  ten  million\ndollars ($10M).\n\n\nSlide #10\n- ---------\n\nNow, let's turn to GTECH's performance on a year to date basis.\n\nService  revenues  for the six months  ended  August 28th were up  approximately\nforty million dollars ($40M) or nine percent (9%) over the same period of fiscal\nyear 2004,  driven by the  continued  strength  in same store  sales  around the\nworld, new contracts and the impact of acquisitions.\n\nProduct sales were higher in the first six months of this year, primarily due to\nhigher terminal sales and the impact of acquisitions.\n\n\nSlide #11\n- ---------\n\nYear-to-date,  we recorded two hundred  sixty-nine  million  dollars  ($269M) in\nrevenue  from our US  lottery  group --- two  hundred  and  sixty-three  million\ndollars  ($263M)  from  the   international   lottery  group  ---  approximately\nthirty-one  million  dollars  ($31M) in gaming  solutions and forty-one  million\ndollars in commercial and other services ($41M).\n\n\nSlide #12\n- ---------\n\nIn the first six months of the  fiscal  year,  we  generated  approximately  one\nhundred  and  seventy-two  million  dollars  ($172M)  in cash  from  operations.\nCombined  with  cash and short  term  investments  on the  balance  sheet,  this\nfinanced over three hundred  million  dollars  ($300M) in investing  activities,\nrepresenting new contract assets and acquisitions.\n\nIn addition,  we paid cash  dividends of twenty  million  dollars  ($20M) and we\naccelerated our return of cash to shareholders via the share repurchase program.\nOn a  year-to-date  basis,  we  repurchased  a total of three  point six million\nshares  (3.6M)  of our  stock at a cost of  approximately  eighty-three  million\ndollars ($83M).\n\nAs of August 28th, we had cash of  approximately  thirty million  dollars ($30M)\nand we had approximately two hundred fifty-six million dollars ($256M) available\nunder our revolving line of credit.\n\n\nSlide #13\n- ---------\n\nAverage capital employed grew by over four hundred million dollars  ($400M),  or\nfifty-two  percent  (52%),  year-over-year  and we generated  returns on capital\nemployed of nineteen point two percent  (19.2%).  In view of the pace of capital\ninvestment,  we are pleased to have been able to maintain returns on the overall\nportfolio at more than two times (2x) our weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAgain,  our  Return  on  Capital   Employed   calculation  is  provided  in  the\nSupplemental Financial Data File posted on our website.\n\nThose are the key financial  highlights of our second quarter and  year-to-date.\nNow I would like to turn our  attention  to the  outlook  for the  remainder  of\nfiscal year 2005.\n\n\nSlide #14\n- ---------\n\nBased upon the strength of our performance year-to-date, we are confident in our\nability to deliver  results in line with the full year  guidance  we provided at\nthe end of June.\n\nBased upon our current  outlook,  we continue to expect total revenue  growth in\nthe range of eighteen to nineteen  percent  (18% - 19%),  with  service  revenue\ngrowth in the range of five to seven percent (5% - 7%), based upon the following\nassumptions and factors:\n\n1) Same store  sales  growth of four to six percent (4% - 6%), 2) The net effect\nof contract  wins and  contractual  rate  changes,  3)  Fluctuations  of foreign\ncurrency  against  the US  Dollar,  4) The  impact of the  acquisitions  we have\ncompleted to date, and 5) The impact of the 30% withholding of Brazil revenues.\n\nWe continue to expect  product  sales in the range of two hundred and ten to two\nhundred and twenty million dollars ($210M - $220M).\n\nWe expect service margins in the range of forty to forty-two percent (40% - 42%)\nand product margins in the range of thirty-six to  thirty-eight  percent (36% to\n38%).\n\nWith respect to our tax rate, we continue to believe that the effective tax rate\nfor this fiscal year will be thirty-five  to thirty-six  percent (35% - 36%), or\none to two  percent  (1% - 2%)  lower  than the  thirty-seven  percent  (37%) we\nreported  in the first half of the fiscal  year.  This is  primarily  due to the\nchange in the  composition of our revenues and profits as a result of our recent\nacquisitions of non-US-based  companies. We expect the lion's share of the catch\nup to occur in the third quarter.\n\nBased upon this outlook,  we believe that diluted  earnings per share will be in\nthe range of one dollar  and  forty-three  cents to one  dollar and  forty-eight\ncents ($1.43 to $1.48) per share for fiscal year 2005,  assuming a fully diluted\nshare count of one hundred and thirty-three point seven million (133.7M) shares.\n\nThis estimate includes the impact of the net one-time gain recorded in the first\nquarter.\n\nIn fiscal year 2005, we plan to invest  between five hundred and twenty and five\nhundred  and forty  million  dollars  ($520M - $540M),  including  the  recently\ncompleted  acquisitions.  This  investing  activity  will be funded by cash from\noperations and borrowings under our revolving line of credit.\n\n\nSlide #15\n- ---------\n\nNow let's look at the outlook for our third quarter, which ends November 27th.\n\nWe expect  service  revenues to increase six to eight  percent (6% - 8%) quarter\nover  quarter  and we  expect  product  sales  in the  range  of  fifty-five  to\nsixty-five million dollars ($55M - $65M).\n\nWe expect service  margins to be in the range of  thirty-eight  to forty percent\n(38% to 40%) and product  margins in the range of  thirty-seven  to  thirty-nine\npercent (37% to 39%).\n\nWe believe  the tax rate for the quarter we will be  approximately  thirty-three\npercent (33%), due to the reasons I mentioned earlier.\n\nFinally,  we expect  earnings  per share to be in the range of  thirty-three  to\nthirty six cents  ($0.33 to $0.36) per share.  This  compares to the thirty five\ncents  ($0.35) per share we reported in the third  quarter of last fiscal  year,\nwhich  included  a  one-time,   after-tax  non-cash  gain  associated  with  the\nconsolidation  of the partnership that owns our corporate  headquarters  here in\nRhode Island.  Excluding  that gain,  recurring  earnings per share in the third\nquarter of last year were  thirty-two  cents  ($0.32) per share,  as reported by\nFirst Call.\n\n\nSlide #16\n- ---------\n\nTo summarize ... We are pleased with the continued strength of our core business\nand the progress we have made in  integrating  our recent  acquisitions,  we are\nexcited about the opportunities we see in each of the markets we serve - - - and\nbased on our  current  outlook,  we are  confident  we can achieve our goals and\nobjectives in the current fiscal year and beyond.\n\nThank you for your  attention.  Now  Bruce  and I would be happy to  answer  any\nquestions that you may have.\n\n\n\n[Q&A]\n\n\n\nCLOSING REMARKS\nIf there are no further  questions,  allow me to briefly summarize our prospects\nfor the remainder of fiscal 2005 and beyond.\n\nGTECH  remains  on  track  to meet  its  full-year  goals  and  objectives.  Our\nlonger-term  strategy  and outlook  likewise  are  unchanged.  And we are making\ncontinued  progress  in our  efforts  to  drive  new,  profitable  growth  while\nreturning value to our shareholders.\n\nWe will be back in December with our third-quarter  earnings call ... but in the\nmeantime,  we look forward to seeing many of you in Las Vegas next month at G2E.\nSpielo  will have a booth on the trade  show  floor  for the first  time,  as we\nintroduce our machines and games to the commercial gaming marketplace.
