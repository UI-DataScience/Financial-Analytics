Net loss\nfrom continuing operations was $0.4\xa0million for the 2004 second quarter\ncompared to a net loss of $2.9\xa0million for the comparable 2003 period. Net\nloss from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2004 benefited from a\ngain on the settlement of a warrant obligation of $0.2\xa0million. Net loss from\ncontinuing operations for second quarter of 2003 benefited from the elimination\nand reduction of accruals aggregating $0.6\xa0million and from a tax benefit of\n$0.7\xa0million. Without these benefits, the net loss from continuing operations\nfor the 2004 and 2003 second quarter would have been $0.6\xa0million and $4.2\nmillion, respectively. Management believes that comparison of its 2004 and\n2003 second quarter net loss without the effect of the above-described items\nprovides a useful measure for investors to compare the Company\x92s\nperiod-to-period results of operations. After accounting for income from\ndiscontinued operations, net loss for the second quarter of 2004 was $248,000\n($0.01 per basic and diluted share), compared to a net loss of $27,000 ($0.00\nper basic share and diluted share) for the 2003 second quarter.\n\n\n', u'Revenue for the six months ended June\xa030, 2004 was $161.5\xa0million, compared to\n$103.4\xa0million for the first half of 2003, an increase of 56%. Net loss from\ncontinuing operations was $1.2\xa0million for the 2004 first half, compared to a\nnet loss of $2.9\xa0million for the comparable 2003 period. Net loss from\ncontinuing operations for the first half of 2004 benefited from a gain on the\nsettlement of a warrant obligation of $0.2\xa0million. Net loss from continuing\noperations for the first half of 2003 benefited from the elimination and\nreduction of accruals aggregating $1.2\xa0million and from a tax benefit of $0.9\nmillion. Without these benefits, the net loss from continuing operations for\nthe 2004 and 2003 first half would have been $1.4\xa0million and $5.0\xa0million,\nrespectively. Management believes that comparison of its 2004 and 2003 first\nhalf net loss without the effect of the above-described items provides a useful\nmeasure for investors to compare the Company\x92s period-to-period results of\noperations. After accounting for income from discontinued operations, net loss\nfor the first half of 2004 was $130,000 ($0.00 per basic share and diluted\nshare), compared to a net income of $292,000 ($0.01 per basic and diluted\nshare) for the 2003 first half.\n\n\n', u'Roy T.

While our results for the first half of 2004 have been negatively\nimpacted by the startup costs associated with multiple lines of DC-10 work for\na major new customer, we continue to see a trend toward outsourced aircraft\nmaintenance as well as strong growth in our engineering and interior related\nbusinesses.\x94\n\n\n', u'TIMCO Aviation Services, Inc. is among the world\x92s largest providers of fully\nintegrated aviation maintenance, repair and overhaul (MR&O) services for major\ncommercial airlines, regional air carriers, aircraft leasing companies,\ngovernment and military units and air cargo carriers.
