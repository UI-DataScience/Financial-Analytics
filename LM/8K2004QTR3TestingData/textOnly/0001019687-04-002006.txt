(AMEX: SLP),\nthe leading provider of ADME absorption simulation and neural net\nstructure-to-property prediction software for pharmaceutical discovery and\ndevelopment, today reported preliminary revenues and estimated earnings for the\nfiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended August 31, 2004.\n\n         Momoko Beran, chief financial officer of Simulations Plus, said: "Our\npreliminary pharmaceutical software and services revenues were $868,000 for the\nfourth quarter compared to $1,403,000 for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003\n(which included a large multi-year software license of over $1 million), and for\nthe fiscal year, $2,856,000, compared to $3,106,000 for fiscal 2003. Performance\nin our Words+ subsidiary improved, reporting preliminary revenues of $599,000\nand a return to profitability, indicating that our restructuring has achieved\nthe desired effect. Total revenues were $1,467,000 for the fourth quarter\ncompared to last year\'s fourth quarter of $2,026,000 which included the $1\nmillion plus order. Total preliminary revenues for the 2004 fiscal year were\n$5,208,000, compared to $5,485,000 in fiscal 2003."\n\n         Ms. Beran continued, "Based on the information we have right now, we\nexpect fourth quarter earnings to be between $0.11 and $0.13 per diluted share,\nand for the fiscal year, between $0.16 and $0.19 per diluted share. The company\nis financially strong, with zero debt and a good cash position." Ms. Beran also\nannounced, "This release of preliminary revenues and earnings is the last one we\nwill do. From now on, in order to reduce the redundancy in our reporting and\nfiling requirements, we will follow the practice of most other companies and\nprovide information when the 10Q and 10K reports are filed."\n\n         Walt Woltosz, chairman and chief executive officer of Simulations Plus,\ncommented: "This quarter saw substantial growth in our core pharmaceutical\nsoftware and services business without the benefit of a large multi-site global\nlicense award we had expected from a current customer. We continue to believe\nthat this customer is in the process of receiving the requisite multi-layer\ninternal approvals for completion in the near future. It\'s important to note\nthat we\'re increasing the pharmaceutical software and services business base\nwith a larger number of smaller customers, and that should continue to add to\nour recurring revenues with our annual license business model. We\'ve maintained\nsteady growth, growing profitability, and made significant expansions to our\nproduct line this year. Our new product development activities are on track and\nwe expect release of both DDDPlus and MembranePlus before the end of the\ncalendar year. This will increase the number of core products from three to\nfive. Feedback from potential customers who have seen previews of these new\ntools has been encouraging."\n\n         Woltosz continued: "In addition to our software, Simulations Plus\ncontinues to enjoy a reputation for world-class expertise in oral absorption,\npharmacokinetics, and related areas. In fact, our consulting revenues during\nthis last quarter exceeded any other quarter, an area of business that we\nbelieve will continue to grow. During the fourth quarter, we received our\nlargest study contract to date to assist a generic drug company with analyzing\ndata from two trials that failed to establish bioequivalence for a new generic\nformulation. This study, which involved complex data taken from hundreds of\nindividual doses in both fasted and fed conditions, was a new milestone for us,\nand showed that our unique software and expertise is of significant value to the\nindustry."\n\n                                       1\n', u'\n\nABOUT SIMULATIONS PLUS, INC.\n\nSimulations Plus, Inc., is a premier developer of groundbreaking drug discovery\nand development simulation software, which is licensed to and used in the\nconduct of drug research by major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies\nworldwide.
