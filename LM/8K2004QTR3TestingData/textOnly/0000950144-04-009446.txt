(NYSE:OXM) announced today financial\nresults for the first quarter ended August 27, 2004. The Company reported that,\nfor the quarter, net sales increased 9% to $265 million from $242 million in the\nfirst quarter of fiscal 2004.\n\nDiluted earnings per share for the first quarter decreased to $0.36 from $0.42\nin the first quarter of fiscal 2004. The Company noted that earnings per share\nwere affected by the write-off of $1.8 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, in\ndeferred financing fees to amend its revolving credit agreement. The Company\'s\nmost recent guidance assumed this charge would be approximately $0.05 per share.\nAdditionally, the Company noted that $0.06 per share of non-cash intangible\nasset amortization costs associated with the Tommy Bahama and Ben Sherman\nacquisitions were included in operating expenses in the first quarter.\n\nJ. Hicks Lanier, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Oxford Industries,\nInc., commented, "While the challenging retail environment had an impact on\nresults in our historical businesses, we were very pleased with the performance\nof our branded businesses and continue to be optimistic with respect to our\nfull-year outlook. Tommy Bahama continues to be very well received by the\nmarkets and to have excellent opportunities for continued growth. The Ben\nSherman business, which was added to our Menswear Group following its\nacquisition on July 30th, delivered strong results for the quarter, particularly\nin its US operations. We believe that Ben Sherman, along with Tommy Bahama, will\ncontinue to fuel our results as we go forward."\n\nThe Tommy Bahama Group contributed $93.5 million in sales in the first quarter,\nan increase of 48% over last year when results from its operations were included\nfor an eleven week period. Sales growth resulted from increased wholesale\npenetration and revenues from eleven more retail stores than were open during\nthe year-ago quarter. Operating income for this segment was $11.9 million for\nthe quarter, an increase of 71% over the eleven-week first quarter last year.\n\n\n                                      More\n', u'\nThe Menswear Group reported first quarter sales of $118.7 million compared to\nsales of $115.8 million last year. Ben Sherman, which was included for only one\nmonth during the first quarter following its July 30th acquisition, contributed\napproximately $17 million in sales. The Company noted that last year\'s first\nquarter included the last of the initial fixture fill of Lands\' End product for\nSears retail stores and the last remnants of the discontinued Izod Club Golf\nbusiness, neither of which anniversaried this year. First quarter operating\nincome in this segment was $8.9 million, a decrease of 6% from the same period\nlast year. The decline in profitability was the result of de-leveraging on a\nsales decline in its historical business, which was partially offset by higher\noperating profitability in the recently acquired Ben Sherman business.\n\nFirst quarter sales for the Womenswear Group declined to $52.5 million from\n$63.0 million last year. The Company attributed the sales decline to continued\nlower shipments of women\'s apparel to WalMart, whose sales in this product\ncategory have been sluggish for the past several months. Lower than expected\ncomparable store sales trends at several major customers led to the deferral of\nsome orders from the first quarter. Continuing margin pressure and the sales\nshortfall resulted in an operating loss of $1.0 million for the first quarter\ncompared to operating income of $3.2 million in the year ago quarter.\n\nThe Company commented that, despite some near term challenges in its historical\nbusiness, it continues to be comfortable with a full year range of diluted\nearnings per share of $2.70 to $2.85 on sales of approximately $1.285 billion to\n$1.325 billion.\n\nFor the second quarter, ending on November 26, 2004, the Company continues to\nanticipate sales in a range from $305 million to $315 million and earnings per\nshare of $0.48 to $0.52.\n\nMr. Lanier continued, "We have a variety of strong opportunities for growth\nduring the remainder of the year and believe that we are positioned for a strong\nsecond half. We expect to deliver record financial results for the year driven\nby the contributions of Tommy Bahama and Ben Sherman and supported by new\ninitiatives in a number of our historical businesses. We look forward to\ncontinuing to deliver superior returns and drive value to our shareholders."\n\nThe Company will hold a conference call with senior management to discuss the\nfinancial results at 4:30 p.m. ET today.
