We believe that free cash flow is useful to investors and management\nas an indication of the ability of our business to generate cash.

The specific items that are excluded from, and result in, our\nnon-GAAP EPS financial measure are clearly identified as such in the press release. We\nbelieve that our non-GAAP EPS financial measure presented with these adjustments best\nreflect our ongoing performance and business operations during the periods presented and\nare more useful to investors for comparative purposes.
