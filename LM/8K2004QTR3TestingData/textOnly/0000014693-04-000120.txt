Earnings  growth was driven\nprimarily by continued volume and margin  improvement from the company's premium\nspirits portfolio and profits from the company's  introductory  shipments of its\nnew  low-carbohydrate  wine  brands,  One.6  Chardonnay  and  One.9  Merlot.  In\naddition,  this quarter  benefited from the absence of an approximate  $0.06 per\nshare charge related to last year's legal  settlement with a former  distributor\nin the United Kingdom.  Partially  offsetting this first quarter earnings growth\nwas continued softness within the Consumer Durables segment,  higher pension and\npostretirement  expenses,  volume declines for Fetzer Premium  Varietals,  and a\ndecline in profits from Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails.\n\nAdjusting for the $10 million of legal settlement expenses incurred in the first\nquarter of the prior year,  the current year benefit of the  company's  new wine\nbrands,  favorable foreign exchange, and the net effect of restructuring charges\nin both segments, the company's operating income grew by 15%.\n\n", u"\n\nBeverages\n\nThe Beverage segment  benefited from a healthy  environment for premium spirits,\nparticularly  in the United States.  Global  depletion  trends for the company's\nmost important brand, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey,  accelerated in the first\nquarter. Depletions are nine-liter case movements from wholesale distributors to\nretailers,  and  are  generally  used  in  the  spirits  and  wine  industry  to\napproximate  consumer demand.  Jack Daniel's volumes increased at a double-digit\nrate in the United  States and in half the  brand's  ten  largest  international\nmarkets.  Southern Comfort  depletions grew in the mid-single digits globally as\nContinental  Europe  improved  over its weak  performance  last year.  Finlandia\ndepletions  continued  to  increase in the United  States and  Poland,  but were\nsluggish in other global  markets.  Results for the company's  core wine brands,\nFetzer  Premium  Varietals  and  Bolla,  remained  soft  due  to  the  intensely\ncompetitive  retail price  environment  in the United  States.  However,  Korbel\nChampagne grew its volume in the mid-single  digits and  strengthened its market\nshare leadership in the sparkling wine category.\n\nBeverage  revenue and gross profit increased by 12% and 13%,  respectively,  for\nthe quarter.  Growth was driven  primarily by higher global volumes and improved\npricing for both Jack  Daniel's  and  Southern  Comfort,  the  establishment  of\ninitial trade  inventories for One.6  Chardonnay and One.9 Merlot,  and a modest\nbenefit from a weaker U.S. dollar.\n\nBeverage advertising expenses increased 8% during the quarter,  driven by higher\nbrand-building  investments behind Jack Daniel's and Finlandia,  and promotional\ninvestments supporting the launch of the new low-carbohydrate wine products.\n\nConsumer Durables\n\nThe environment for the company's Lenox business remained very  challenging.  In\nthe  Durables  segment,  net sales were down 5% and gross  profit  decreased  6%\nduring the quarter,  despite  increases in revenue and gross profit for Hartmann\nluggage.  Lenox sales to  department  stores were sluggish and revenues from the\ncompany's  retail outlets  declined in the first  quarter.  As a result of lower\nconsumer  response  rates,  revenues  also  declined  in the  direct-to-consumer\nchannel.\n\n", u'\n\nConsumer  Durables is a seasonal  business that typically  reports a loss in the\nfirst  quarter.  The segment  reported  an  operating  loss of $15 million  this\nquarter,  including approximately $3 million in restructuring charges,  compared\nto a $12 million loss during the same period last year. The new management  team\nat  Lenox  continues  to  focus  its  efforts  on  rationalizing   marginal  and\nunprofitable  businesses,   creating  organizational  efficiencies,   increasing\nmanufacturing and operational  efficiency,  building its brands, and meeting end\nconsumer needs.\n\nOutlook\n\nFirst  quarter  financial  results were very strong,  even after  excluding  the\nbenefit from the company\'s new low-carbohydrate wine product  introduction,  the\nabsence of last year\'s  legal  settlement  and  restructuring  charges,  and the\nmodest benefit from favorable foreign exchange earnings.  Earnings  expectations\nfor the full fiscal year,  however,  are tempered by the  competitive  pressures\nwithin the U.S. table wine category and the difficult environment for key pieces\nof the Consumer Durables segment.  Additionally,  the company is contemplating a\nreduction in field  inventories  resulting  from a  continuing  evolution of its\nworldwide distribution system.  However, as a result of its strong first quarter\nperformance,  and the underlying strength in its premium spirits portfolio,  the\ncompany  is raising  previously  provided  earnings  guidance,  and now  expects\nearnings in the range of $2.35 to $2.43 per share for fiscal 2005.\n\nConference Call\n\nBrown-Forman  will host a conference  call to discuss its first  quarter  fiscal\n2005 results  today at 10:00 a.m.  EDT.

These  factors  could  cause our actual\nresults to differ materially from  Brown-Forman\'s  historical  experience or our\npresent expectations or projections.  Here is a non-exclusive list of such risks\nand uncertainties:\n\n - changes in general economic conditions, particularly in the United States\n   where we earn the majority of our profits;\n - a strengthening U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, especially the\n   British Pound;\n - reduced bar, restaurant, hotel and travel business in wake of other terrorist\n   attacks, such as occurred on 9/11;\n - developments in the class action lawsuits filed against Brown-Forman and\n   other spirits, beer and wine manufacturers alleging that our advertising\n   causes illegal consumption of alcohol by those under the legal drinking age,\n   or other attempts to limit alcohol marketing, through either litigation or\n   regulation;\n - a dramatic change in consumer preferences, social trends or cultural trends\n   that results in the reduced consumption of our premium spirits brands;\n - tax increases, whether at the federal or state level;\n -
