Reports Fiscal 2004 Third Quarter and Nine Months Results\n\n    SOUTH HACKENSACK, N.J., Sept. 13 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- AEP Industries\nInc. (Nasdaq: AEPI, the "Company") today reported financial results for its\nfiscal third quarter and nine months ended July 31, 2004.\n\n    Net sales rose 10.1 percent to $204,872,000 compared with $186,160,000 in\nlast year\'s fiscal third quarter.  Excluding $4,910,000 of positive impact of\nforeign exchange, worldwide net sales increased $13,802,000 or 7.4 percent.\nThe increase in net sales during the 2004 third quarter was primarily driven\nby a 10.7 percent increase in sales volume partially offset by a 3.0 percent\ndecrease in per unit selling prices.\n\n    For the first three quarters of fiscal 2004, net sales increased 9.5\npercent to $591,402,000 compared with $540,190,000 in the first nine months of\nfiscal 2003.  Excluding $31,976,000 of positive impact of foreign exchange,\nworldwide net sales increased $19,236,000 or 3.6 percent.  For the nine-month\nperiod, the increase in net sales was primarily due to a 2.8 percent increase\nin sales volume and a 0.8 percent increase in per unit selling prices.\n\n    Gross profit percentage for the 2004 third quarter improved to 16.9\npercent from 15.8 percent in the 2003 third quarter.  The $5,150,000\nimprovement in gross profit resulted from increased sales volume, primarily in\nNorth America, and was partially offset by a slight decrease in per unit\nselling prices.\n\n    For the nine-month 2004 period, gross profit percentage improved to 17.5\npercent from 16.5 percent in the same period last year.  The $14,200,000\nincrease in gross profit in the first nine months of 2004 is primarily a\nresult of a $3,940,000 positive impact of foreign exchange combined with\nincreased per unit selling prices and increased sales volumes, primarily in\nNorth America.\n\n    Operating expenses in the 2004 third quarter were $795,000 more than the\nthird quarter of 2003.  This increase in operating expenses includes a\nnegative impact of foreign exchange of $600,000 and $1,800,000 in increased\ndelivery costs attributable to increased sales volume and higher fuel costs\nincurred during the period.  These expenses were partially offset by a net\ncost reduction of $1,700,000 resulting from the liquidation of the Italian\noperations ("FIAP") and the closedown of the United Kingdom operations in\n2003.\n\n    For the nine-month period, operating expenses increased $617,000 and\nincluded $4,000,000 of negative impact of foreign exchange effect that was\noffset by the net cost reduction of $4,300,000 resulting from the liquidation\nof FIAP and the closedown of the United Kingdom operations in 2003.\n\n    Income from continuing operations improved to $7,479,000 in the 2004 third\nquarter compared with $2,900,000 in the 2003 third quarter.  This improvement\nbetween the third quarters of fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 is primarily the\nresult of the previously mentioned improvement in sales volume, and the net\neffect of the FIAP liquidation, which increased 2004 third quarter income from\noperations by $271,000.\n\n    The Company reported income from continuing operations of $24,300,000 for\nthe first nine months of fiscal 2004, compared with $10,679,000 in the same\nperiod last year.  This improvement between the first nine months of 2004 and\nthe same period last year is primarily due to improved sales volume and\nmaterial margins, combined with the net effect of the FIAP liquidation, which\nincreased 2004 nine months income from operations by $2,087,000.\n\n    In the 2004 third quarter, the Company had a net loss from continuing\noperations of $1,918,000, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared with a net loss\nfrom continuing operations of $2,122,000, or $0.26 per diluted share, in last\nyear\'s third quarter.  For the nine-month period, AEP reported a net loss from\ncontinuing operations of $1,520,000, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared with\na net loss from continuing operations of $9,155,000, or $1.14 per diluted\nshare, for the first nine months of 2003.\n\n    In July 2004, the Company\'s management approved a plan to sell its Spanish\nsubsidiary and took the first step, as previously announced, that on July 26,\n2004, the Company\'s Spanish subsidiary filed for Suspension of Payments status\nunder Spanish law.  As a result, the Spanish operations are now accounted for\nas discontinued operations.  For the third quarter 2004, the Company had a net\nloss from discontinued operations of $9,654,000, or $1.15 per diluted share,\ncompared with a net income from discontinued operations of $89,000, or $0.01\nper diluted share, in the 2003 third quarter.  For the 2004 nine month period,\nthe net loss from discontinued operations was $11,651,000, or $1.40 per\ndiluted share, compared to a net loss from discontinued operations of\n$480,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the same period last year.\n\n    For the 2004 third quarter the Company reported a net loss of $11,572,000,\nor $1.38 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $2,033,000, or $0.25\nper diluted share in the same quarter last year.\n\n    The net loss for the first nine months of 2004 was $13,171,000, or $1.59\nper diluted share, compared with a net loss of $9,635,000, or $1.20 per\ndiluted share in the first nine months of last year.\n\n    "We are pleased with our North American operations which had increased\nsales volumes and improvements in gross margins, primarily due to our\ncontinuing ability to pass through increases in resin costs to our market\nplace.  We anticipate passing through price increases in our operations during\nthe fourth quarter of 2004.  This is essential to our effort towards improving\nour overall profitability," commented Brendan Barba, Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer of the Company.\n\n    "We are disappointed that our Spanish subsidiary filed for Suspension of\nPayments.  Over the past few years we have had to make difficult decisions\nabout these components of our international operations and we will continue to\ntake the steps necessary to maximize the returns of the entire company,"\nconcluded Mr. Barba.\n\n    The Company invites all interested parties to listen to its third quarter\nconference call live over the Internet at http://www.aepinc.com on Tuesday,\nSeptember 14, 2004 at 10:00 a.m. EDT.
