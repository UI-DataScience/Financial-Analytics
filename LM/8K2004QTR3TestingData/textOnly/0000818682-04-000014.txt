Releases Improved Operating Results For\n                  The Second Quarter Ended July 31, 2004\n                  Net losses narrowed during the quarter\n\nDallas,  TX  -  August 24, 2004 - Harold\'s Stores, Inc. (AMEX symbol:  HLD)\n(the  "Company"),  a chain of upscale ladies\' and men\'s  specialty  apparel\nstores,  announced today improved operating results for the second  quarter\nand year-to-date period ended July 31, 2004.\n\nFor the second quarter, the Company reported a net loss of $1.2 million, or\n$0.23  per  share,  compared to a net loss of $2.2 million,  or  $0.42  per\nshare,  in  the same period of the previous year.  The prior  year  results\nincluded $462,000 of restructuring expenses associated with store closings.\nDuring  the  year-to-date period ending July 31, 2004,  the  net  loss  was\n$451,000, or $0.19 per share, as compared to a net loss of $4.3 million, or\n$0.83  per  share, in the same period of the prior year.   The  prior  year\nresults included $1.6 million of costs associated with store closings.\n\n"During  the  second quarter and first half of this year, we  saw  a  solid\nimprovement  in  our reported operating results, including gross  margins,"\nsaid  Hugh Mullins, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "Reported gross\nmargins  were approximately 35% for the first half of 2004 as  compared  to\nabout  29%  during  the same time last year.  This increase  resulted  from\ngreater  selling  at full price due to the combination of our  having  more\ndesirable merchandise and our strategy of taking a less promotional  stance\nand conducting more timely clearances.  While the second quarter produced a\nloss, it was greatly reduced from last year\'s level, despite the fact  that\nthe  Company\'s  new clearance strategy accelerated more spring  and  summer\nmerchandise markdowns into the second quarter."\n\nMr.  Mullins  continued,  "Sales  on  our  spring  and  summer  merchandise\ncollections exceeded our expectations during the first quarter,  ultimately\ncausing  June\'s inventory levels and sales to be less than plan.   We  were\nable  to  deliver our early fall merchandise deliveries more  heavily  into\nJuly  than  last year, allowing us to achieve our needed inventory  levels.\nThus  far  into  the fall season, we have been pleased with our  customers\'\ninitial  reactions to the merchandise.  Our current inventory, even  though\nslightly below last year\'s levels, consists of a far greater percentage  of\nnew fall merchandise and a significantly lower level of clearance inventory\nthan last year."\n\nFor  the  second  quarter,  the  Company\'s  total  comparable  store  sales\nincreased  2.3%.   Comparable store sales in the full-price  retail  stores\nincreased  2.4%,  on  top  of the 12.0% comparable  stores  sales  increase\nexperienced  in  the  second  quarter  of  the  prior  year.  Outlet  store\ncomparable  sales  decreased 0.7%.  Net sales for the  quarter  were  $19.3\nmillion,  compared  to $19.6 million for the same period  in  the  previous\nyear,  a decrease of 1.4%. Total sales were nearly the same level as  those\nof  last year, despite the closing of unprofitable stores during the  prior\nperiod.\n\nThe  Company\'s total comparable store sales increased 5.7% during the first\nhalf,  increasing  5.7% in the full-price retail stores  and  5.3%  in  the\noutlets.   Net  sales in the first half were $43.5 million as  compared  to\n$44.3  million during the prior year, a decrease of 1.8%.   Net sales  were\nessentially equal to last year\'s, despite the closing of eight unprofitable\nstores during the first six months of the prior year.\n\nFounded in 1948 and headquartered in Dallas, Texas, Harold\'s Stores, Inc.,\ncurrently operates 41 upscale ladies\' and men\'s specialty stores in 19\nstates.
