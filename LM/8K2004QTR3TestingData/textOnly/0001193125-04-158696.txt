(Nasdaq: VYYO), a global supplier of\nbroadband end-to-end solutions for telephony and high-speed data connections, announced that its revenue in the quarter ending September 30, 2004 is likely to be materially below its previous third quarter guidance. The company had previously\nprojected third quarter revenue to be approximately $2.8 to $3.0 million. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Due\nto lower than expected third quarter results and the continued limited visibility in the Chinese broadband wireless market, full year revenue for fiscal year 2004 is also expected to be significantly lower than the original guidance given earlier\nthis year.
