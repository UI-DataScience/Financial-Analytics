("FSP Corp." or the\n"Registrant"), a Maryland corporation, four wholly-owned acquisition\nsubsidiaries of FSP Corp., each a Delaware corporation (the "Acquisition Subs"),\nand four real estate investment trusts, each a Delaware corporation (the "Target\nREITs"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"),\nproviding for (i) FSP Corp.\'s acquisition of each of the Target REITs by merging\neach Target REIT into a related Acquisition Sub, resulting in the Acquisition\nSub being the surviving corporation and (ii) the issuance of approximately\n10,894,994 shares of FSP Corp. Common Stock as consideration in connection with\nthe mergers. Upon consummation of the mergers, the holders of the preferred\nstock of the preferred stock of the Target REITs will become stockholders of FSP\nCorp.\n\n      Pursuant to the requirements of Rule 3-14 of Regulation S-X, this Current\nReport on Form 8-K includes a Statement of Revenues over Certain Operating\nExpenses for FSP Addison Circle Corp., FSP Collins Crossing Corp., FSP Montague\nBusiness Center Corp., and FSP Royal Ridge Corp. for the six months ended June\n30, 2004 (unaudited) and for the three years ended December 31, 2003 or, in the\ncase of FSP Royal Ridge Corp., for the two years ended December 31, 2003, as\nwell as pro forma financial information for FSP Corp. and the acquisition of 13\nreal estate investment trusts completed by FSP Corp. in June 2003. Because\nchanges will likely occur in occupancy, rents and expenses experienced by the\nTarget REITs and because the merger may not be completed, the historical\nfinancial statements and pro forma financial data presented should not be\nconsidered as a projection of future results.\n\n      In connection with the mergers, the Registrant is hereby filing as part of\nthis Current Report on Form 8-K the financial statements and pro forma financial\nstatements set forth below under Item 9.01.\n\n      Upon consummation of the mergers, the Registrant expects to file a Current\nReport under Item 2.01 of Form 8-K, "Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of\nAssets," reporting the information required to be set forth therein.\n\n                           FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nTHIS FORM 8-K CONTAINS FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE\nPRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 AND THE FEDERAL SECURITIES\nLAWS.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPERTY:\n\n      The accompanying statements of revenue over certain operating expenses\n      (the "Statements") include the operations of a recently constructed\n      ten-story Class "A" suburban office tower containing approximately 293,787\n      rentable square feet located on approximately 3.62 acres of land in\n      Addison, Dallas County, Texas (the "Property"). The subject property was\n      purchased by Champion Addison One, LP as a vacant tract of land on\n      November 11, 1997. On September 30, 2002, Champion Addison One, LP sold\n      the property to FSP Addison Circle Corp. (the "Company").\n\n2.    BASIS OF ACCOUNTING:\n\n      The accompanying Statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of\n      accounting. The Statements have been prepared in accordance with Rule 3-14\n      of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission for real\n      estate properties acquired or to be acquired. Accordingly, these\n      Statements exclude certain historical expenses not comparable to the\n      operations of the Property after acquisition such as amortization,\n      depreciation, interest, corporate expenses and certain other costs not\n      directly related to the future operations of the Property.\n\n3.    USE OF ESTIMATES:\n\n      The preparation of the Statements in conformity with the basis of\n      accounting described in Note 2 requires management to make estimates and\n      assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\n      during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those\n      estimates.\n\n4.    CONCENTRATIONS OF RISKS:\n\n      For the six months ended June 30, 2004 and 2003, rental income was\n      received from various lessees. As such, future receipts are dependent upon\n      the financial strength of the lessees and their ability to perform under\n      the lease agreements.\n\n5.    LEASES:\n\n      The Company, as lessor, has minimum future rentals due under a\n      noncancellable operating leases as follows:\n\n                     Year Ending\n                     December 31,         Amount\n                     ------------      ------------\n\n                         2004          $  3,342,000\n                         2005             6,636,000\n                         2006             5,698,000\n                         2007             3,101,000\n                         2008             2,369,000\n                      Thereafter            943,000\n                                       ------------\n\n                                       $ 22,089,000\n                                       ============\n\n      In addition, the lessees are liable for real estate taxes and operating\n      expenses as direct expenses to the lessees.\n\n\n                                       F-3\n', u"\n\n                            FSP ADDISON CIRCLE CORP.\n                        DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002, AND 2001\n\n\n                                 CONTENTS\n\n                                                                            PAGE\n\nIndependent auditors' report                                                 F-5\n\nStatements of revenue over certain operating expenses                        F-6\n\nNotes accompanying the statements of revenue over certain\n   operating expenses                                                        F-7\n\n\n                                       F-4\n", u'\n\n                    [LETTERHEAD OF BRAVER AND COMPANY, P.C.]\n\n\n                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS\' REPORT\n\n\nTo the Stockholders\nFSP Addison Circle Corp.\n\n\nWe have audited the accompanying statements of revenue over certain operating\nexpenses (the "Statements") of FSP Addison Circle Corp. for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001.

We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our\nopinion.\n\nThe accompanying Statements were prepared to comply with the requirements of\nRule 3-14 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and\nexclude certain expenses described in Note 2, and therefore, are not intended to\nbe a complete presentation of the Property\'s revenue and expenses.\n\nIn our opinion, these Statements referred to above presents fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the revenue over certain operating expenses (as described in\nNote 2), of FSP Addison Circle Corp. for the years ended December 31, 2003,\n2002, and 2001, in conformity with the basis of accounting described in Note 2.\n\n\n/s/ Braver and Company, P.C\nNewton, Massachusetts\nFebruary 28, 2004\n\n\n                                       F-5\n', u'\n\n                            FSP ADDISON CIRCLE CORP.\n              STATEMENTS OF REVENUE OVER CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES\n                  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002, AND 2001\n\n\n                                               2003         2002         2001\n                                            ----------   ----------   ----------\n                                                (3)          (2)          (1)\n\nREVENUE\n\n  Rental income                             $8,579,509   $8,679,187   $8,353,790\n                                            ----------   ----------   ----------\n\nCERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES (Note 2):\n\n  Taxes and insurance                        1,354,203    1,257,727    1,195,547\n  Management fees                              216,292      158,765      135,923\n  Administrative                               339,180      592,811      446,024\n  Operating and maintenance                  1,227,418      880,036      905,373\n                                            ----------   ----------   ----------\n\n                                             3,137,093    2,889,339    2,682,867\n                                            ----------   ----------   ----------\n\nExcess of revenue over certain\n  operating expenses                        $5,442,416   $5,789,848   $5,670,923\n                                            ==========   ==========   ==========\n\nProperty Owner:\n3 - FSP Addison Circle Corp\n2 - January 1, 2002 to September 29, 2002 - Champion Addison One, LP\n    September 30, 2002 to December 31, 2002 - FSP Addison Circle Corp.\n1 - Champion Addison One, LP\n\n\n    The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements\n\n\n                                       F-6\n', u'\n\n                            FSP ADDISON CIRCLE CORP.\n  NOTES ACCOMPANYING THE STATEMENTS OF REVENUE OVER CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES\n\n\n1.    DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPERTY:\n\n      The accompanying statements of revenue over certain operating expenses\n      (the "Statements") include the operations of a recently constructed\n      ten-story Class "A" suburban office tower containing approximately 293,787\n      rentable square feet located on approximately 3.62 acres of land in\n      Addison, Dallas County, Texas (the "Property"). The subject property was\n      purchased by Champion Addison One, LP as a vacant tract of land on\n      November 11, 1997. On September 30, 2002, Champion Addison One, LP sold\n      the property to FSP Addison Circle Corp. (the "Company").\n\n2.    BASIS OF ACCOUNTING:\n\n      The accompanying Statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of\n      accounting. The Statements have been prepared in accordance with Rule 3-14\n      of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission for real\n      estate properties acquired or to be acquired. Accordingly, these\n      Statements exclude certain historical expenses not comparable to the\n      operations of the Property after acquisition such as amortization,\n      depreciation, interest, corporate expenses and certain other costs not\n      directly related to the future operations of the Property.\n\n3.    REVENUE RECOGNITION:\n\n      Rental revenue includes income from leases, certain reimbursable expenses,\n      straight-line rent adjustments and other income associated with renting\n      the property. A summary of rental revenue is shown in the following table:\n\n                                                  Year Ended December 31,\n                                             2003          2002          2001\n                                          ----------    ----------    ----------\n\n      Income from leases                  $7,152,563    $7,230,163    $7,168,574\n      Straight-line rent adjustment          321,385       358,091       293,420\n      Reimbursable expenses                1,080,115     1,092,574       887,543\n      Other income                            25,446         1,359         4,253\n                                          ----------    ----------    ----------\n\n         Total                            $8,579,509    $8,682,187    $8,353,790\n                                          ==========    ==========    ==========\n\n\n      The Company has retained substantially all of the risks and benefits of\n      the property and accounts for its leases as operating leases. Rental\n      income from leases, which include rent concessions (including free rent\n      and tenant improvement allowances) and scheduled increases in rental rates\n      during the lease term, is recognized on a straight-line basis. The Company\n      does not have any percentage rent arrangements with its tenants.\n      Reimbursable costs are included in rental income in the period earned.\n\n4.    USE OF ESTIMATES:\n\n      The preparation of the Statements in conformity with the basis of\n      accounting described in Note 2 requires management to make estimates and\n      assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\n      during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those\n      estimates.\n\n5.    CONCENTRATIONS OF RISKS:\n\n      For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, rental income was\n      received from various lessees. As such, future receipts are dependent upon\n      the financial strength of the lessees and their ability to perform under\n      the lease agreements.\n\n\n                                       F-7\n', u'\n\n                            FSP ADDISON CIRCLE CORP.\n  NOTES ACCOMPANYING THE STATEMENTS OF REVENUE OVER CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES\n\n\n6.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPERTY:\n\n      The accompanying statements of revenue over certain operating expenses\n      (the "Statements") include the operations of a commercial building located\n      in Dallas County, Texas (the "Property"). The Property is an eleven-story\n      Class "A" institutional quality suburban office tower containing\n      approximately 298,766 square feet of rentable space. The Property was\n      owned by Collins Crossing Limited Partnership and sold to FSP Collins\n      Crossing Corp. (the "Company") on March 3, 2003.\n\n2.    BASIS OF ACCOUNTING:\n\n      The accompanying Statement have been prepared on the accrual basis of\n      accounting. The Statements have been prepared in accordance with Rule 3-14\n      of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission for real\n      estate properties acquired or to be acquired. Accordingly, these\n      Statements exclude certain historical expenses not comparable to the\n      operations of the Property after acquisition such as amortization,\n      depreciation, interest, corporate expenses and certain other costs not\n      directly related to future operations of the Property.\n\n3.

Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Statements\nare free of material misstatements. An audit includes examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the Statements.

We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our\nopinion.\n\nThe accompanying Statements were prepared to comply with the requirements of\nRule 3-14 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and\nexclude certain expenses described in Note 2 and, therefore, are not intended to\nbe a complete presentation of the Property\'s revenue and expenses.\n\nIn our opinion, these Statements referred to above present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the revenue over certain operating expenses (as described in\nNote 2), of FSP Collins Crossing Corp. for the years ended December 31, 2003,\n2002 and 2001, in conformity with the basis of accounting described in Note 2.\n\n\n/s/ Braver and Company, P.C.\nNewton, Massachusetts\nFebruary 28, 2004\n\n\n                                      F-14\n', u'\n\n                           FSP COLLINS CROSSING CORP.\n              STATEMENTS OF REVENUE OVER CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES\n                  YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002, AND 2001\n\n\n                                           2003           2002           2001\n                                        ----------     ----------     ----------\n                                            (3)            (2)            (1)\nRevenue\n\n  Rental income                         $7,810,887     $7,719,461     $7,231,817\n                                        ----------     ----------     ----------\n\n                                         7,810,887      7,719,461      7,231,817\n                                        ----------     ----------     ----------\n\nCertain operating expenses\n\n  Taxes and insurance                      916,353        906,803      1,080,465\n  Management fees                          211,726        148,990        136,467\n  Administrative                           102,130         64,208         59,948\n  Operating and maintenance              1,392,632      1,165,129      1,320,489\n                                        ----------     ----------     ----------\n\n                                         2,622,841      2,285,130      2,597,369\n                                        ----------     ----------     ----------\n\nExcess of revenue over certain\n  operating expenses                    $5,188,046     $5,434,331     $4,634,447\n                                        ==========     ==========     ==========\n\nProperty Owner:\n   3 - March 3, 2003 to December 31, 2003 - FSP Collins Crossing Corp.\n   3 - January 1, 2003 to March 2, 2003 - Collins Crossing Limited Partnership\n   2 - Collins Crossing Limited Partnership\n   1 - Collins Crossing Limited Partnership\n\n\n    The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements\n\n\n                                      F-15\n', u'\n\n                           FSP COLLINS CROSSING CORP.\n  NOTES ACCOMPANYING THE STATEMENTS OF REVENUE OVER CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES\n\n\n1.    DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPERTY:\n\n      The accompanying statements of revenue over certain operating expenses\n      (the "Statements") include the operations of a commercial building located\n      in Dallas County, Texas (the "Property"). The Property is an eleven-story\n      Class "A" institutional quality suburban office tower containing\n      approximately 298,766 square feet of rentable space. The Property was\n      owned by Collins Crossing Limited Partnership and sold to FSP Collins\n      Crossing Corp. (the "Company") on March 3, 2003.\n\n2.    BASIS OF ACCOUNTING:\n\n      The Statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting. The\n      Statements have been prepared in accordance with Rule 3-14 of Regulation\n      S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission for real estate properties\n      acquired or to be acquired. Accordingly, these Statements exclude certain\n      historical expenses not comparable to the operations of the Property after\n      acquisition such as amortization, depreciation, interest, corporate\n      expenses and certain other costs not directly related to future operations\n      of the Property.\n\n3.    REVENUE RECOGNITION:\n\n      Rental revenue includes income from leases, certain reimbursable expenses,\n      and straight-line rent adjustments associated with renting the property.\n\n                                                   Year Ended December 31,\n                                               2003         2002         2001\n                                            ----------   ----------   ----------\n\n      Income from leases                    $6,822,916   $6,747,319   $6,415,650\n      Straight-line rent adjustment            332,181      294,140      252,620\n      Reimbursable expenses                    655,790      678,002      563,547\n                                            ----------   ----------   ----------\n\n         Total                              $7,810,887   $7,719,461   $7,231,817\n                                            ==========   ==========   ==========\n\n      The Company has retained substantially all of the risks and benefits of\n      the Property and accounts for its leases as operating leases. Rental\n      income from leases, which includes rent concessions (including free rent\n      and tenant improvement allowances) and scheduled increases in rental rates\n      during the lease term, is recognized on a straight-line basis. The Company\n      does not have any percentage rent arrangements with its tenants.\n      Reimbursable costs are included in rental income in the period earned.\n\n4.    USE OF ESTIMATES:\n\n      The preparation of the Statements in conformity with the basis of\n      accounting described in Note 2 requires management to make estimates and\n      assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\n      during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those\n      estimates.\n\n5.    CONCENTRATIONS OF RISKS:\n\n      For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, rental income was\n      from three lessees. As such, future receipts are dependent upon the\n      financial strength of these lessees and their ability to perform under the\n      lease agreements.\n\n\n                                      F-16\n', u'\n\n                           FSP COLLINS CROSSING CORP.\n  NOTES ACCOMPANYING THE STATEMENTS OF REVENUE OVER CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES\n\n\n6.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPERTY:\n\n      The accompanying statements of revenue over certain operating expenses\n      (the "Statements") include the operations of a commercial building located\n      in San Jose, California (the "Property"). The Property consists of two\n      adjacent single-story Class "A" suburban office buildings containing\n      145,951 square feet located on 9.95 acres of land. The Property was owned\n      by Teacher\'s Insurance and Annuity Association of America and TlAA Realty,\n      Inc. and sold to FSP Montague Business Center Corp (the "Company") on\n      August 27, 2002.\n\n2.    BASIS OF ACCOUNTING:\n\n      The accompanying statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of\n      accounting. The Statements have been prepared in accordance with Rule 3-14\n      of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission for real\n      estate properties acquired or to be acquired. Accordingly, these\n      Statements exclude certain historical expenses not comparable to the\n      operations of the Property after acquisition such as amortization,\n      depreciation, interest, corporate expenses and certain other costs not\n      directly related to future operations of the Property.\n\n3.    USE OF ESTIMATES:\n\n      The preparation of the Statements in conformity with the basis of\n      accounting described in Note 2 requires management to make estimates and\n      assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\n      during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those\n      estimates.\n\n4.    CONCENTRATIONS OF RISKS:\n\n      For the six months ended June 30, 2004, and 2003, rental income was from\n      various lessees. As such, future receipts are dependent upon the financial\n      strength of the lessees and their ability to perform under the lease\n      agreements.\n\n5.    LEASES:\n\n      The Company, as lessor, has minimum future rentals due under\n      noncancellable operating leases as follows:\n\n                       Year Ending\n                       December 31,          Amount\n                       ------------       ------------\n\n                           2004           $  1,991,000\n                           2005              4,174,000\n                           2006              4,390,000\n                                          ------------\n\n                                          $ 10,555,000\n                                          ============\n\n      In addition, the lessees are liable for real estate taxes and operating\n      expenses as direct expenses to the lessees.\n\n\n                                      F-21\n', u"\n\n                              FSP MONTAGUE BUSINESS\n                                  CENTER CORP.\n                        DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001\n\n\n                                    CONTENTS\n                                                                            PAGE\n\nIndependent auditors' report                                                F-23\n\nStatements of revenue over certain operating expenses                       F-24\n\nNotes accompanying the statements of revenue over certain\n   operating expenses                                                       F-25\n\n\n                                      F-22\n", u'\n\n                    [LETTERHEAD OF BRAVER AND COMPANY, P.C.]\n\n\n                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS\' REPORT\n\n\nTo the Stockholders\nFSP Montague Business Center Corp.\n\n\nWe have audited the accompanying statements of revenue over certain operating\nexpenses (the "Statement") of FSP Montague Business Center Corp. for the years\nended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Rental\n      income from leases, which includes rent concessions (including free rent\n      and tenant improvement allowances) and scheduled increases in rental rates\n      during the lease term, is recognized on a straight-line basis. The Company\n      does not have any percentage rent arrangements with its tenants.\n      Reimbursable costs are included in rental income in the period earned.\n\n4.    USE OF ESTIMATES:\n\n      The preparation of the Statements in conformity with the basis of\n      accounting described in Note 2 requires management to make estimates and\n      assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\n      during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those\n      estimates.\n\n5.    CONCENTRATIONS OF RISKS:\n\n      For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, rental income was\n      from various lessees. As such, future receipts are dependent upon the\n      financial strength of the lessees and their ability to perform under the\n      lease agreements.\n\n\n                                      F-25\n', u'\n\n                       FSP MONTAGUE BUSINESS CENTER CORP.\n  NOTES ACCOMPANYING THE STATEMENTS OF REVENUE OVER CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES\n\n\n6.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPERTY:\n\n      The accompanying statements of revenue over certain operating expenses\n      (the "Statements") include the operations of a commercial building located\n      in Alpharetta, Georgia (the "Property"). The Property is a recently\n      constructed six-story Class "A" institutional quality suburban office\n      tower containing approximately 161,366 square feet of rentable space\n      completed in December 2001. The Property was owned by CK Royal 400, LLC\n      and sold to FSP Royal Ridge Corp. (the "Company") on January 30, 2003.\n\n2.    BASIS OF ACCOUNTING:\n\n      The accompanying Statement have been prepared on the accrual basis of\n      accounting. The Statements have been prepared in accordance with Rule 3-14\n      of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission for real\n      estate properties acquired or to be acquired. Accordingly, these\n      Statements exclude certain historical expenses not comparable to the\n      operations of the Property after acquisition such as amortization,\n      depreciation, interest, corporate expenses and certain other costs not\n      directly related to future operations of the Property.\n\n3.    USE OF ESTIMATES:\n\n      The preparation of the Statements in conformity with the basis of\n      accounting described in Note 2 requires management to make estimates and\n      assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\n      during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those\n      estimates.\n\n4.    CONCENTRATIONS OF RISKS:\n\n      For the six months ended June 30, 2004, and 2003, rental income was\n      received from three lessees. As such, future receipts are dependent upon\n      the financial strength of these lessees and their ability to perform under\n      the lease agreements.\n\n5.

We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our\nopinion.\n\nThe accompanying Statements were prepared to comply with the requirements of\nRule 3-14 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and\nexclude certain expenses described in Note 2 and, therefore, are not intended to\nbe a complete presentation of the Property\'s revenue and expenses.\n\nIn our opinion, these Statements referred to above present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the revenue over certain operating expenses (as described in\nNote 2) of FSP Royal Ridge Corp. for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,\nin conformity with the basis of accounting described in Note 2.\n\n\n/s/ Braver and Company, P.C.\nNewton, Massachusetts\nFebruary 28, 2004\n\n\n                                      F-32\n', u'\n\n                              FSP ROYAL RIDGE CORP.\n              STATEMENTS OF REVENUE OVER CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES\n                     YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002\n\n\n                                                          2003           2002\n                                                       ----------     ---------\n                                                           (2)           (1)\nRevenue\n\n  Rental income                                        $2,693,318     $   3,084\n                                                       ----------     ---------\n\n                                                        2,693,318         3,084\n                                                       ----------     ---------\n\nCertain operating expenses\n\n  Taxes and insurance                                     273,948       184,096\n  Management fees                                          73,071        33,212\n  Administrative                                          108,814        62,264\n  Operating and maintenance                               649,604       526,358\n                                                       ----------     ---------\n\n                                                        1,105,437       805,930\n                                                       ----------     ---------\n\nExcess of revenue (deficit) over certain\n  operating expenses                                   $1,587,881     $(802,846)\n                                                       ==========     =========\n\n Property Owner:\n 2 - January 1, 2003, to January 29, 2003 - CK Royal 400, LLC\n 2 - January 30, 2003, to December 31, 2003 - FSP Royal Ridge Corp.\n 1 - CK Royal 400, LLC\n\n\n    The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements\n\n\n                                      F-33\n', u'\n\n                              FSP ROYAL RIDGE CORP.\n  NOTES ACCOMPANYING THE STATEMENTS OF REVENUE OVER CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES\n\n1.    DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPERTY:\n\n      The accompanying statements of revenue over certain operating expenses\n      (the "Statements") include the operations of a commercial building located\n      in Alpharetta, Georgia (the "Property"). The Property is a recently\n      constructed six-story Class "A" institutional quality suburban office\n      tower containing approximately 161,366 square feet of rentable space\n      completed in December 2001. The Property was owned by CK Royal 400, LLC\n      and sold to FSP Royal Ridge Corp. (the "Company") on January 30, 2003.\n\n2.    BASIS OF ACCOUNTING:\n\n      The accompanying Statement have been prepared on the accrual basis of\n      accounting. The Statements have been prepared in accordance with Rule 3-14\n      of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission for real\n      estate properties acquired or to be acquired. Accordingly, these\n      Statements exclude certain historical expenses not comparable to the\n      operations of the Property after acquisition such as amortization,\n      depreciation, interest, corporate expenses and certain other costs not\n      directly related to future operations of the Property.\n\n3.    REVENUE RECOGNITION:\n\n      Rental revenue includes income from leases, certain reimbursable expenses,\n      and straight-line rent adjustments associated with renting the property. A\n      summary of rental revenue is shown in the following table:\n\n                                           Year Ended December 31,\n                                            2003            2002\n                                         ----------      ----------\n      Income from leases                 $1,152,591      $       --\n      Straight-line rent adjustment         954,172              --\n      Reimbursable expenses                 586,555           3,084\n                                         ----------      ----------\n\n        Total                            $2,693,318      $    3,084\n                                         ==========      ==========\n\n      The Company has retained substantially all of the risks and benefits of\n      the Property and accounts for its leases as operating leases. Rental\n      income from leases, which includes rent concessions (including free rent\n      and tenant improvement allowances) and scheduled increases in rental rates\n      during the lease term, is recognized on a straight-line basis. The Company\n      does not have any percentage rent arrangements with its tenants.\n      Reimbursable costs are included in rental income in the period earned.\n\n4.    USE OF ESTIMATES:\n\n      The preparation of the Statements in conformity with the basis of\n      accounting described in Note 2 requires management to make estimates and\n      assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\n      during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those\n      estimates.\n\n5.    CONCENTRATIONS OF RISKS:\n\n      For the years ended December 31, 2003, and 2002, rental income was\n      received from three lessees. As such, future receipts are dependent upon\n      the financial strength of these lessees and their ability to perform under\n      the lease agreements.\n\n\n                                      F-34\n', u'\n\n                              FSP ROYAL RIDGE CORP.\n  NOTES ACCOMPANYING THE STATEMENTS OF REVENUE OVER CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES\n\n6.

The\npro forma balance sheets are presented as if the mergers occurred as of June 30,\n2004. The pro forma statements of income are presented as if the mergers\noccurred as of the beginning of the period.\n\n      The mergers will be treated as a purchase of assets and each Target REIT\'s\nassets and liabilities will be recorded on FSP Corp.\'s books at their fair value\nas of the effective date of the mergers.\n\n                              PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS\n\n      Certain assumptions regarding the operations of FSP Corp. have been made\nin connection with the preparation of the pro forma condensed consolidated\nfinancial information. These assumptions are as follows:\n\n      (a)   FSP Corp. and each of the Target REITs have elected to be, and are\n            qualified as, a real estate investment trust for federal income tax\n            purposes. Each entity has met the various required tests; therefore,\n            no provision for federal or state income taxes have been reflected\n            on real estate operations.\n\n\n      (b)   FSP Corp. has subsidiaries which are not in the business of real\n            estate operations. Those subsidiaries are taxable as real estate\n            investment trust subsidiaries (each, a "TRS") and are subject to\n            income taxes at regular tax rates. The taxes on income shown in the\n            pro forma statements of operations are the taxes on income incurred\n            by the TRS. There are no material items that would cause a deferred\n            tax asset or a deferred tax liability.\n\n\n                                      F-42\n', u'\n\n                        Franklin Street Properties Corp.\n         NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n                                   (Unaudited)\n\n\n      (c)   The costs of the mergers to FSP Corp. are estimated at $500,000 and\n            are reflected as paid as of June 30, 2004 and are capitalized to the\n            assets acquired.\n\n      (d)   The cost of the property (including capitalized merger costs of\n            $500,000) has been allocated to real estate investments, acquired\n            lease origination costs and acquired favorable leases. Acquired\n            lease origination costs represent the value associated with\n            acquiring an in-place lease (i.e. the market cost to execute a\n            similar lease, including leasing commission, legal, vacancy and\n            other related costs). Acquired favorable leases represents the value\n            associated with a lease which has a rental stream with above market\n            rates. The value assigned to buildings land and to leases\n            approximates their fair value.\n\n            The following schedule shows the allocation of the aggregate cost of\n            the properties based upon appraised values. Depreciation and\n            amortization for the Target REITs is based on a preliminary\n            allocation of the purchase price to real estate investments and to\n            the leases acquired. The allocation is subject to change as\n            additional information is obtained.
