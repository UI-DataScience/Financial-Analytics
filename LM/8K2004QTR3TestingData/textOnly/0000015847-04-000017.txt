We just completed our third profitable year, April 30, 2004 and increased this profit in first quarter fiscal 2005.

Our plans are to provide support to currently available aircraft that will operate with a positive cost benefit picture into the middle of the 21", u'st', u' century.', u'\n', u'\nCurrently, our backlog is in excess of $11,500,000 reflecting the potential to realize the results of our product development efforts.

We are pleased to see the growth in our backlog for our new Classic Aviation Products and Services.  Significant accomplishments were made by all operating segments and in gaming.  However, because of our major investment in product development, we may not always maintain smooth and continuous quarterly profits.', u'\n', u'\nI am pleased with the continued progress by our people in this fiscal year.
