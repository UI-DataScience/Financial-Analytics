(Nasdaq: ISSI), announced today that it expects its revenue and\nearnings for the September 2004 quarter will be lower than the Company\'s\nprevious guidance provided on July 22, 2004.  The Company now expects that\nrevenue for the September 2004 quarter will be in the range of approximately\n$30 million to $33 million.  Further, the Company expects to report a loss for\nthe quarter.\n\n    "The quarter began with a combination of too much inventory in the channel\nand a seasonal slow down.  We needed a strong second half of the quarter and\nit just has not materialized," said Jimmy Lee, Chairman and CEO.  "Because of\nthe slow down, average selling prices for our lower density SDRAMs have\ndropped substantially from last quarter.  This decline has hurt top line\nrevenue and squeezed gross margins.  As a result, we will post a loss for the\nquarter."\n\n    ISSI has scheduled its regularly held quarterly conference call for\nThursday, October 28, 2004 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time to discuss the company\'s\nfinancial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2004.
