(Nasdaq/NMS:\nMAXE) today reported third quarter 2004 financial results.\n\nRevenues for the third quarter of 2004 rose 6% to a third quarter record $42.1\nmillion from $39.6 million for the third quarter of 2003. Net income and net\nincome per diluted share fell from $620,000 or $0.24 per diluted share for the\nthird quarter of 2003 to a net loss of $70,000 or $(0.03) per diluted share for\nthe third quarter of 2004.\n\nYear-to-date revenues increased 8% to $137.4 million for 2004 from $127.6\nmillion for 2003. Year-to-date net income and net income per share declined 39%\nand 38%, respectively to $1,318,000 or $0.51 per diluted share for 2004 from\n$2,178,000 or $0.82 per diluted share for 2003.\n\nTodd Barnum, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Max & Erma\'s, said this\nyear\'s revenue growth is due to the opening of six restaurants during 2003, two\nrestaurants opened thus far in 2004 and the opening of five franchised\nrestaurants during the last 12 months, which have contributed to a 35% growth in\nfranchise fees and royalties year-to-date. Mr. Barnum went on to say that\nsame-store sales were flat year-to-date, but off 1.25% during the third quarter\nof 2004. Mr. Barnum attributed the sluggish sales to concerns over the economy,\nhigher gas prices and unusual competitive situations affecting several of the\ncompany\'s restaurants.\n\nMr. Barnum said that in addition to soft sales, record high commodity prices put\npressure on margins during the quarter. He noted that higher ground beef,\nchicken and cheese prices increased food cost by over three and a half\npercentage points or $1.25 million for the quarter. He went on to say that we\nare attacking this problem in several different ways. Specs and portions are\nbeing reviewed along with all purchasing procedures and contracts. He said that\nat the end of the quarter the company contracted for chicken at a $1.5 million\nannual savings.\n\nMr. Barnum said that the reduced profitability will lead to a slower growth rate\nuntil margins improve. Three restaurants will open in the fourth quarter of 2004\nand a total of three are planned for 2005. He added that the company also\nexpects franchisees will open five restaurants in 2005.\n\nAs of August 1, 2004 Max & Erma\'s owns and operates 75 casual dining\nfull-service restaurants in Akron, Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Dayton,\nNiles and Toledo, Ohio; Indianapolis, Indiana; Detroit, Ann Arbor, Grand Rapids\nand Lansing, Michigan; Pittsburgh and Erie, Pennsylvania; Lexington and\nLouisville, Kentucky; Chicago, Illinois; Charlotte, North Carolina; Atlanta,\nGeorgia, Virginia Beach and Norfolk, Virginia.
