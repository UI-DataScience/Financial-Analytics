ANNOUNCES 2004 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS\n                   -----------------------------------------------\n\n       ST. LOUIS, MO. - AUGUST 26, 2004 - CPI CORP. (NYSE: CPY) today\n       reported a net loss for the 12-week second quarter ended\n       July 24, 2004 of $9.1 million, or $1.14 per diluted share compared\n       to a net loss of $826,000, or $0.10 per diluted share for the\n       comparable quarter in fiscal 2003.  As is discussed more fully in\n       the following paragraphs, the timing of Easter in 2004 versus 2003\n       had a significant negative impact on the comparability of reported\n       second quarter sales in 2004 compared to 2003.  In addition, the\n       overall results of the second quarter of 2004 were also significantly\n       impacted by the recording of other charges and impairments and the\n       completion of the Company's previously announced plans to exit\n       both its Mexican and mobile photography operations which began\n       operations in 2002.  Other charges and impairments totaling $3.9\n       million, $2.9 million on an after-tax basis or $0.36 per diluted\n       share were recorded in the second quarter of 2004 consisting\n       principally of severance accruals related to previously announced\n       corporate headquarters staff reductions, asset write-downs and\n       write-offs resulting from ongoing changes in strategic technology\n       direction and accruals related to early contract terminations\n       and settlements.  During the second quarter of 2004, the Company\n       recorded a loss from discontinued operations, net of income tax\n       benefits $2.6 million related to the discontinuance of its Mexican\n       and mobile photography operations.  The $2.6 million recorded in the\n       second quarter of 2004 related principally to exit costs, a\n       substantial portion of which were non-cash charges relating to asset\n       write-offs and write-downs, to effectuate the operational shut down\n       of the businesses and to a much lesser extent ongoing operating\n       losses during the period of operation during the second quarter\n       prior to shut down.  This $2.6 million loss in 2004 compares to an\n       $809,000 loss from such operations in the comparable quarter of 2003.\n\n       Consolidated net sales for the second quarter of 2004 decreased $12.3\n       million or 20.2% to $48.6 million from the $60.9 million reported in\n       the second quarter of 2003.  The timing of Easter, a seasonably\n       important time for portraiture sales, had a significant impact on the\n       timing of recognition of sales revenues between the Company's first\n       and second quarters.  Most of the Company's Easter-related sales in\n       2004, an earlier Easter, were recognized as revenues, in accordance\n       with the Company's revenue recognition policies, in the first fiscal\n       quarter while such sales in 2003, a later Easter, were principally\n       recognized in the second fiscal quarter. The comparability impact\n       on the Company's first and second quarter sales related to the timing\n       of Easter in 2003 and 2004 is eliminated by reference to year-to-date\n       sales comparisons for the 24-week periods ended July 24, 2004 and\n       July 19, 2003 which reflect a $13.5 million decrease or 11.6% to\n       $103.5 million from the $117.1 million recorded in the first 24 weeks\n       of 2003.\n\n       2004 FIRST HALF RESULTS\n       -----------------------\n\n       The Company reported a net loss for the 24-week first half of 2004 of\n       $17.9 million, or $2.22 per diluted share compared to a net loss of\n       $3.6 million or $0.44 per diluted share reported in the comparable\n       first half of fiscal 2003.  The overall results of the first half of\n       2004 were significantly impacted by the recording of other charges\n       and impairments totaling $13.5 million, $9.1 million on an after-tax\n       basis or $1.14 per diluted share.  Other charges and impairments\n       recorded in the first half of 2004 are summarized below:\n\n                                       AMOUNTS RECORDED IN 2004\n                                       ------------------------\n       Nature of Charge                  First       Second\n                                        Quarter      Quarter    Total\n       ----------------                 -------      -------  ---------\n                                     (in thousands)\n\n       Consent solicitation costs*      $   846        -      $     846\n\n       Accruals related to\n        accelerated vesting of\n        supplemental retirement plan\n        and guaranteed bonuses for\n        2004                              3,414           76      3,490\n\n       Reserves for potential\n        severance obligations/\n        related costs                     2,036        1,147      3,183\n\n       Impairment charges                 3,067        2,078      5,145\n\n       Other                                200          640        840\n                                       --------      -------    -------\n          Total                        $  9,563      $ 3,941    $13,504\n                                       ========      =======    =======\n\n       * Includes approximately $148,000 of total consent-related costs\n         incurred by the Knightspoint Group, which the Company has\n         reimbursed.\n\n       The consent solicitation costs represent the costs incurred in the\n       first quarter related to the then-ongoing consent solicitation contest.\n       The accruals related to the accelerated vesting of executives covered\n       by the Company's supplemental retirement plan ($3.3 million) and\n       guaranteed bonuses provided for in employment contracts for those\n       covered executives whose employment continues with the Company ($76,000\n       per quarter) were both triggered by change of control provisions in\n       employment contracts as a result of the change in the composition of\n       the Company's Board resulting from the completion of the consent\n       solicitation.  The reserves for potential severance obligations\n       recorded in the first quarter were triggered by the dismissal of\n       certain executives during the quarter.  The amounts recorded in the\n       second quarter relate to severance accruals associated with corporate\n       headquarters staff reductions that occurred during the quarter.\n       During the first quarter of 2004, the Company's reconstituted Board\n       along with its new management leadership in the technology function,\n       made a decision to materially alter the Company's previously planned\n       and recently in-process technology platform that was to serve as the\n       foundation for the eventual conversion to full digital technology in\n       our studios.  As a result of this decision, certain previously\n       capitalized software development costs related to the development of\n       the previous platform no longer have future utility to the Company\n       and, accordingly, have been written off.  During the second quarter\n       of 2004, additional strategic decisions were made regarding the\n       Company's technology platform that necessitated the write-off or\n       write-down of certain other technology-related assets.  The other\n       category for the first quarter relates to the write-off of a\n       non-refundable loan commitment fee paid and recorded as a prepaid\n       asset prior to the change of control.  The second quarter charges\n       relate to accruals resulting from early contract terminations and\n       settlements with certain of the Company's vendors.\n\n       As previously discussed, total net sales for the first half of 2004\n       decreased $13.5 million or 11.6% to $103.5 million from the $117.1\n       million recorded in the first half of 2003.  This sales decline was\n       driven by a 9% decrease in sittings from 1,794,000 to 1,638,000 coupled\n       with a 4% decline in average sales per customer sitting from $64.91 to\n       $62.39.  The Company believes that the continuing decline in first half\n       sittings is attributable to several external and internal factors.\n       Among the external factors are the impacts of continuing competitive\n       pressures, including the opening of new competitor locations and severe\n       price discounting.  In addition, the rate at which customers continue\n       to adopt amateur digital photography technologies has accelerated which\n       may be impacting the frequency of studio visits.  Internal factors\n       potentially negatively impacting sittings include the Company's\n       decision, beginning in the second half of 2003, to reduce studio\n       employment costs through lower allocations of hours toward coverage\n       and training/retention, which allocation is currently being partially\n       restored, as well as potential effects from reduced advertising spending\n       in the fourth quarter of 2003 which is being addressed by implementation\n       of a more targeted and focused marketing approach in the second half of\n       2004.  In  addition, it is likely that some customers visiting our\n       studios are receiving a less than optimal experience as a result of\n       certain technology and support challenges caused by our aging studio\n       infrastructure which also is currently under review as part of the new\n       Board's review of options to transition the studios to full digital\n       technology.\n\n       The net decrease in average sale per customer sitting is the result of\n       increased discounting in response to competitive pricing pressures and\n       the elimination of sitting fees on certain offers targeted at new\n       customer acquisition, partially offset by the positive impact of a\n       continuing mix shift toward the higher value custom offer.\n\n       Through the first four weeks of the third quarter, sales continue to\n       run significantly below those of the comparable period of the prior year\n       by being down approximately 13%, driven by a 15% decline in sittings\n       being only partially offset by a 2% increase in average sale per\n       customer sitting.\n\n       There are a number of initiatives currently under way and under\n       consideration for the second half of the year designed to reverse the\n       negative sales trend experienced over the past several years and\n       continuing in the first half of 2004.  These initiatives include, among\n       others, a studio hardware upgrade, a full digital test in a meaningful\n       number of studios, increased studio coverage hours, pricing/offer\n       changes and more targeted marketing support.\n\n       Losses from continuing operations for the first half of 2004 were $20.5\n       million compared to $3.7 million in the first half of 2003.  Excluding\n       other charges and impairments recorded in the first half of 2004\n       totaling $13.5 million, losses from continuing operations would have\n       increased $3.3 million to $7.0 million from the $3.7 million recorded\n       in the comparable period of 2003.  This $3.3 million increase in\n       operating losses from continuing operations is the result of a $13.5\n       million sales shortfall which was partially offset by decreases in cost\n       of sales of $1.4 million and selling, general and administrative\n       expenses of $8.6 million.  The decrease in selling, general and\n       administrative expenses is primarily attributable to decreases in\n       employment costs of $3.2 million $2.6 million related to studio\n       employment costs and $600,000 related to corporate headquarters\n       employment costs), decreased commissions due Sears of $2.2 million\n       and overall net decreases in various other categories of expenses\n       resulting from the Company's cost reduction initiatives.  The decline\n       in studio employment costs is the result not only of lower sitting\n       and sales volumes but is also partially attributable to the Company's\n       previously-discussed decision beginning in the second half of 2003 to\n       reduce studio employment costs through lower allocation of hours toward\n       coverage and training.  The decline in corporate headquarters employment\n       costs is the result of previously discussed executive and staff\n       reductions that took place near the end of the first quarter and during\n       the second quarter of 2004.\n\n       BUSINESS STRATEGY UPDATE\n       ------------------------\n\n       The Company's recently reconstituted Board is continuing its process of\n       reviewing, assessing and taking actions with respect to the Company's\n       business strategy.  To date, several executive leadership changes have\n       been made and the Company has exited its Mexican and mobile photography\n       operations commenced in 2002.  In addition, the Company has materially\n       altered its previously planned and recently in-process technology\n       platform that was to serve as the foundation for an eventual conversion\n       to full digital technology in our studios.  The Company continues to\n       review and evaluate its options to transition the studios to full\n       digital technology as rapidly as is prudently possible, including the\n       rollout in the second half of 2004 of full digital technology to a\n       meaningful number of our studios.  At the same time, management and\n       the Board continue to evaluate a potential return of capital.\n\n\n                                      * * * * * *\n\n       A conference call and audio webcast are scheduled for Friday,\n       August 27th 10:00 a.m. Central Time to discuss the second quarter\n       financial results and provide a Company update.
