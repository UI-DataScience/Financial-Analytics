(Aug. 30, 2004) -- Calavo Growers, Inc. (Nasdaq-NM: CVGW), the\nglobal leader in packing and distributing fresh and processed avocados and other\nperishable fruit products, today reported fiscal 2004 third-quarter and\nnine-month operating results.\n\n        For the three months ended July 31, 2004, net revenues climbed to $83.3\nmillion, the highest quarterly total in company history, up from $81.4 million\nin the like period of fiscal 2003. Third-quarter net income approximated $3.1\nmillion, equal to $0.23 per fully diluted share. This compares with net income\nof $3.2 million, or $0.25 per fully diluted share, in the year-earlier third\nquarter. Per share results for the recently concluded quarter are based on\napproximately four percent greater shares outstanding than in last year\'s third\nquarter, in part due to Calavo\'s all-stock acquisition of Maui Fresh\nInternational completed in Nov. 2003.\n\n        Calavo stated that its profitable financial results in the most recently\nconcluded quarter are principally attributable "to a strong performance in the\ncompany\'s California avocado segment, which experienced significant volume\ngrowth." The company reported that increased sales from the International\navocados and perishable food products (International) segment also contributed\nto third-quarter revenue growth.\n\n        As a result of the sales expansion in the International operating\nsegment, net revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 increased 14\npercent to a record $208.8 million, from $183.0 million in the corresponding\nperiod one-year earlier. Nine-month net income was $5.1 million, equivalent to\n$0.38 per fully diluted share, which compares with $5.5 million, or $0.42 per\ndiluted share, in the corresponding period one-year earlier. Lee E. Cole,\nchairman, president and chief executive officer, stated: "Calavo\'s focused\napproach to implementing its strategic operating agenda enabled the company to\ncomplete another successful quarter and nine months. The company continues to\ngain sales momentum, as reflected by our record revenues for the three and\nnine-month periods, and make notable progress on a range of initiatives intended\nto anchor future growth and profitability."\n\n        Specifically, Cole referenced advances made along several business\nfronts including:\n\n\n', u'\n    -   A significant increase in third-quarter volume of fresh California\n        avocados compared to the prior year, due to a significantly larger\n        domestic crop. The company estimates its quarter to date share of the\n        California avocado market totaled 33.4 percent, which represents an\n        increase from the prior year, which was 31.7%.\n\n    -   Increased growth from International segment sales, including continued\n        robust demand from the Japanese market.\n\n    -   The first full quarter of operation of the company\'s new, 90,000-plus\n        square foot processed-products manufacturing facility in Uruapan,\n        Michoacan, Mexico, which opened in February 2004.\n\n    "With respect to the new facility," Cole said, "while third-quarter sales in\nthe Processed Products segment fell beneath plan, we continue to gain\nefficiencies, and to build inventories to levels at which we can satisfy\ncustomer demand."\n\n    "Simply put, we believe this new plant will ultimately bring unprecedented\nefficiencies to our processed unit. However, this process is taking longer then\nanticipated," Cole stated.\n\n        Turning to Calavo\'s commitment to cost containment, Cole stated that\nselling, general and administrative expenses decreased by nearly four percent\nfrom last year\'s third quarter, and are virtually unchanged for the nine-month\nperiod.\n\n        "We view our ability to control SG&A -- even as Calavo mounts ambitious\ninitiatives, like the Uruapan processing facility, and contends with higher\nemployee salary and benefit costs -- as testament to a rigorous discipline of\nholding the line on costs that is central to the company mindset," Cole said.\n\n        The Calavo balance sheet remains "strong and virtually free of long-term\ndebt," Cole added. At July 31, 2004, shareholders\' equity totaled $46.9 million,\nan increase of 26 percent from $37.1 million at the end of fiscal 2003.\n\nCALIFORNIA AVOCADOS\n\n        California avocado sales of $66.7 million were $1.2 million, or 1.8\npercent below the $67.9 million in last year\'s fiscal third period. The decrease\nin sales reflects lower average selling prices, partially offset by a\nsignificantly larger number of units sold.\n\n\n\n                                       2\n', u'\nINTERNATIONAL\n\n        International segment sales increased 110 percent to $9.8 million, a\njump of $5.1 million from $4.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. This\nincrease is principally due to sales from the company\'s tropical fruit and\nspecialty products.\n\nPROCESSED PRODUCTS\n\n        Net sales in the processed products segment fell 23 percent to $6.8\nmillion from $8.8 million in the comparable quarter one year ago. The factors\nimpacting the business unit\'s performance are thought by management to be\ntransitional in nature. Sales were adversely affected as inventory levels were\nnot adequate to meet processed-product customer demand.\n\nFOURTH QUARTER OUTLOOK\n\n        "We are proceeding into the fourth quarter with increasing momentum and\na sense of confidence about our business units," said Cole. "The California\nAvocado segment is expected to continue yielding robust volume, particularly\nwhen measured against last year\'s seasonally lower domestic crop. "\n\n        "International segment sales are expected to remain strong for the\nremainder of the fiscal year" he continued. "The outlook for our Processed\nProducts segment is positive due to the substantial elimination of the use of\nco-packers, the expected closing of our Mexicali operations, and the increased\nlevels of inventory to service customer demand. We expect continued progress\nfrom our processed products segment, but have no illusions about this occurring\novernight and expect that the greatest gains may not be evident until next\nfiscal year."\n\nABOUT CALAVO\n\n        Calavo Growers, Inc. is a worldwide leader in the procurement and\nmarketing of fresh and processed avocados, as well as other perishable food\nproducts.
