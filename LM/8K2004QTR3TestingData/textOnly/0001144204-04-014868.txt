(NASDAQ: NXXI),\nthe leading developer and marketer of chromium-based nutritional supplements,\ntoday announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended\nJune 30, 2004.\n\n      Revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.8 million, compared to $1.8\nmillion for the comparable period a year ago. Net loss for the fourth quarter\nwas $2.6 million or $(0.07) loss per diluted share, compared to a net loss for\nthe fourth quarter of last fiscal year of $7.0 million or ($0.22) loss per\ndiluted share. The fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003 included an impairment\ncharge of $4.4 million. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004, Nutrition 21\nreported total revenues of $10.2 million, compared to $10.6 million for the same\nperiod a year ago. Net loss for fiscal year 2004 was $5.9 million or $(0.16)\nloss per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $10.5 million or ($0.32) loss\nper diluted share for the prior year. The Company closed the year with over $4\nmillion in cash.\n\n      Gail Montgomery, President and CEO of the Company commented, "While total\nrevenues were slightly less than the prior year, we are pleased to report a $1.6\nmillion increase in gross profit in fiscal year 2004 with gross margins\napproaching 80%. This improvement is directly related to our fiscal year 2003\ndecision to discontinue our investment in the Lite Bites(R) product line and\nfocus our sales and business development efforts on our chromium technologies.\nChromax(R) chromium picolinate, our flagship ingredient, which is licensed for\nuse in nearly 85% of all US chromium mineral supplement products, accounted for\nmore than 85% of our product sales in fiscal year 2004.\n\n      "We intend to continue strengthening our ingredients business, which\nremains a strong contributor to cash flow. According to the Nutrition Business\nJournal, chromium enjoyed 26% growth in calendar year 2003, an annual growth\nrate that exceeds all other minerals in the vitamin and supplement category. As\nour clinical research and communications programs unfold to emphasize the\nessential role of chromium in maintaining healthy insulin function in people\nwith or at risk for diabetes and heart disease, we expect to further stimulate\nthat growth.\n\n      "Establishing the therapeutic role of our chromium-based products in\nreducing the risk and symptoms associated with diabetes is a key element of our\nstrategy. Researchers at Harvard University and Johns Hopkins University have\nrecently shown correlations between low chromium status and the signs and\nsymptoms of type 2 diabetes. The National Institutes of Health is now funding an\nindependent research program to determine the public health implications\nassociated with chromium nutrition. If government research validates chromium\'s\npivotal role in human metabolism, the chromium market may one day rival that of\ncalcium, which is estimated at more than $1 billion in retail supplement sales.\n\n      "The filing of our FDA health claim petition to obtain diabetes and\ninsulin resistance prevention claims for chromium picolinate was a key fiscal\n2004 milestone. We anticipate that we will receive guidance from the FDA on the\npetition before the end of this calendar year. In the months ahead we will also\nbe reporting on the exciting results of our ongoing chromium research program.\nWe expect that data generated by studies completed in fiscal year 2004 will 1)\nfurther confirm the safety of chromium picolinate; 2) present a new method of\nmeasuring chromium status in humans; 3) provide new insights into chromium\npicolinate\'s mechanism of action that further confirms its role as an insulin\nsensitizer; and 4) provide clinical evidence of chromium\'s ability to be to an\neffective treatment of type 2 diabetes. As the peer-reviewed study results are\npublished, we plan to aggressively publicize these findings to increase the\ndemand for chromium picolinate use in vitamin and supplement formulas.\nAdditionally, once the safety and efficacy of Chromax chromium picolinate are\nwell established, we will actively market to functional food and beverage\nmanufacturers. This will be a new market for the Company\'s ingredient products.\n\n', u'\n\n      "We are also pleased to report that our Diachrome(R) research program is\non track for completion in November. In August 2004, the final patient was\nenrolled in a definitive study being conducted by XLHealth, a disease management\ncompany. In fiscal year 2005, we look forward with confidence to reporting on\nthis large-scale study designed to pharmaceutical standards. We were pleased to\nreport on the results of two clinical trials in fiscal year 2004. Data obtained\nin these trials showed that Diachrome, when used as an adjunct to traditional\noral anti-diabetic agents in people with type 2 diabetes, can significantly\nimprove blood sugar and lipid control. The study outcomes compared favorably to\nthose seen with prescription medications. Assuming positive Diachrome study\noutcomes in the large-scale trial, the Company hopes to have XLHealth\nincorporate Diachrome into its treatment protocol. This will be a key step in\nthe Company\'s longer term program to secure government and health care approval\nof Diachrome as a reimbursed first line medical nutrition therapy for all US\npatients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes."\n\n      Montgomery closed, "We are proud of our fiscal year 2004 accomplishments\nand believe the Company is on track to deliver on its promise of investing in\ngold standard clinical research to reposition Chromax chromium picolinate as the\npremium chromium ingredient in the newly reinvigorated chromium market. We have\nbuilt strong alliances with key researchers at leading academic diabetes and\nobesity centers, including, Harvard, Yale, University of Pennsylvania,\nPennington Biomedical Research Center and Duke University. Importantly, this\ninvestment in research has also created a scientific foundation that is paving\nthe way for the launch of Diachrome as a finished consumer product that will\ninitially be marketed through healthcare professionals.\n\n      "The most significant research spending is now behind us. Our proprietary\nchromium technology platform is well positioned to capitalize on the burgeoning\ndiabetes and pre-diabetes markets, and the Company is poised to fully\ncommercialize its potential. Our organization has been strengthened by several\nkey hires and a more streamlined focus. We are in a good cash position and will\nmaintain our NASDAQ listing at least through 2005 if we either satisfy the\nminimum $1 bid price and other initial listing criteria, or continue to meet\nnon-stock price initial listing criteria and commit that we will reverse split\nour stock by early January 2006. In summary, fiscal year 2005 promises to be a\nreal turning point for the Company."\n\n      About Nutrition 21\nNutrition 21 is a biosciences company dedicated to the research, development and\ncommercialization of innovative chromium-based nutrition products for improved\nhealth maintenance, and for the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases\nsuch as diabetes, insulin resistance, obesity, depression and cardiovascular\ndisease.
