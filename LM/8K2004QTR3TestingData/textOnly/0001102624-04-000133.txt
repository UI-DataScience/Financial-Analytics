The information contained herein and in the accompanying Exhibit shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing with the SEC made by Finisar Corporation whether before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language contained in such filing.\n', u'\n', u'The Company provides in the press release and conference call certain non-GAAP financial measures. As used herein, "GAAP" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude from the directly comparable GAAP measures a number of non-cash and cash charges described in the press release. As required by Regulation G, the press release contains a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide an alternative method for measuring the operating performance of the Company\'s business, excluding certain items that would normally be included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Company\'s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company\'s operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be co\nnsidered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as reported by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled items reported by other companies.\n', u'\n', u'Item 9.01.

The\ncall will be broadcast live over the Internet on the Investor Relations\nsection of Finisar's web site, located at www.Finisar.com.  To listen to\nthe Webcast, interested investors are encouraged to log onto the broadcast\nat least 15 minutes prior to the call. Participating in the call will be\nJerry Rawls, Finisar's President and CEO, and Steve Workman, Finisar's CFO.\n", u'\n', u'\nTotal revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 of $61.9 million were up\n9% on a sequential basis from $57.0 million in the fourth quarter and 57%\nfrom $39.4 million in the first quarter of the prior year. Total revenues\nfrom the sale of optical subsystems of $53.8 million in the first quarter\nwere up 11% on a sequential basis from $48.7 million in the fourth quarter\nand 57% from $34.2 million in the first quarter of the prior year. Sales of\nnetwork test and monitoring systems of $8.1 million in the first quarter\nwere down 3% on a sequential basis from $8.3 million in the fourth quarter\nbut up 55% from $5.2 million in the first quarter of the prior year.\n', u'\n', u'\nRevenues in the first quarter included a full quarter of operating results\nof the VCSEL business unit acquired from Honeywell on March 2, 2004.\nExcluding the impact of this acquisition, total revenues were up 4% on a\nsequential basis from the fourth quarter and 33% from the first quarter of\nthe prior year.\n', u'\n', u'\n"Our revenues for the quarter increased as we had predicted at the\nbeginning of the quarter.   Achieving this increase was not easy because of\nthe softness in our LAN/SAN business during the early portion of the\nquarter," said Jerry Rawls. "More recently, we have seen a resurgence of\norders for both our LAN/SAN and Metro business. This combined with the\nrecent acquisition of Data Transit which fills a gap in our Network Tools\nbusiness should result in another sequential increase in sales for next\nquarter."\n', u'\n', u'\n"Gross margins on a non-GAAP basis improved to 26% in the first quarter\nfrom 22% last quarter," added Rawls. "Higher operating expenses offset much\nof this improvement due in part to a number of non-recurring charges\nrelated to new product introductions."\n', u'\n', u'\nOPERATING RESULTS\n', u'\n', u'\nThe Company reported a net loss of $22.1 million, or $0.10 per share, for\nthe first quarter of fiscal 2005, compared to a net loss of $24.5 million,\nor $0.11 per share, in the fourth quarter and a net loss of $41.2 million,\nor $0.20 per share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. A gross profit of\n$10.6 million, or 17.1% of revenues, during the first quarter of fiscal\n2005, compared to $9.4 million, or 16.5% of revenues, in the fourth quarter\nand a loss of $1.7 in the first quarter of the prior year.\n', u'\n', u'\nAmortization of acquired developed technology, amortization of purchased\nintangibles, purchased research and development in-process, other\nacquisition costs and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting\nrelated to the adoption of SFAS 142 consist of merger-related costs\nassociated with several acquisitions completed during fiscal 2001 through\n2004.\n', u'\n', u'\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL RESULTS\n', u'\n', u'\nThe Company provides non-GAAP financial measures to complement its\nconsolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. These\nnon-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the user\'s overall\nunderstanding of the Company\'s current financial performance and its\nprospects for the future. Specifically, the Company believes the non-GAAP\nresults provide useful information to both management and investors by\nidentifying certain expenses, gains and losses that, when excluded from the\nGAAP results, may provide additional understanding of the Company\'s core\noperating results or business performance. However, these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures are not intended to supercede or replace the Company\'s\nGAAP results. A detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP results to the GAAP\nresults is provided in the "Non-GAAP Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nOperations" schedules below.\n', u'\n', u"\nOperating results reported on a non-GAAP basis exclude a number of non-cash\nand cash charges related to deferred compensation, acquisitions, minority\ninvestments, inventory obsolescence, a discount associated with the\nCompany's convertible debt offering in October 2001 and inducements\nassociated with the conversion of a portion of the notes, the loss realized\nupon the closure of certain facilities and the accelerated depreciation on\ncertain assets abandoned in connection with those closures, along with\nother restructuring charges, and a non-cash charge representing research\nand development in-process related to the acquisition of Honeywell's VCSEL\nBusiness Unit.\n", u'\n', u'\nThe Company reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 26.1% in the first quarter\nof fiscal 2005 compared to 21.9% in the prior quarter and 27.9% in the\nfirst quarter of the prior year. The improvement on a sequential basis\nreflects higher revenue levels and the favorable impact of acquiring the\nVCSEL business unit from Honeywell in the fourth quarter as well as\ncontinued improvement in yields and reduced material costs.\n', u'\n', u'\nThe Company reported a non-GAAP net loss of $14.3 million, or $.06 per\nshare, in the first quarter compared to $14.2 million, or $.06 per share,\nin the fourth quarter and $12.6 million, or $.06 per share, in the first\nquarter of the prior year.
