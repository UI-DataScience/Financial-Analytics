(Nasdaq: SPEC), a leading designer and manufacturer\nof electronic control products and systems, today reported results for the\nthird quarter ended August 31, 2004.\n    For the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company reported net income of\n$997,000 or eight cents per share on sales of $20,180,000, compared to net\nincome of $29,000 or zero cents per share on sales of $15,354,000 for the same\nperiod last year. For the first nine months of fiscal 2004, the Company had\nnet income of $3,137,000 or 24 cents per share on sales of $58,789,000. For\nthe comparable period of 2003, the Company had net income of $445,000 or three\ncents per share on sales of $46,070,000.\n    Dick Southworth, the Company\'s President and Chief Executive Officer\ncommented, "Compared to last year, our overall operating performance continues\nto significantly improve. Total customer orders received in the third quarter\namounted to $20.0 million, an increase of $4.4 million or 29% from a year ago.\nDemand for our signal integrity products was particularly strong, with\ncustomer orders received in the current quarter of $13.4 million, an increase\nof $3.7 million or 38% from the comparable quarter of 2003. Our signal\nintegrity products are used in numerous applications and industries including\ntelecommunications, military, aerospace, automotive, and medical. Total\nshipments in the current quarter grew to $20.2 million, an increase of\n$4.8 million or 31% from a year ago. The higher shipment level, combined with\nour continuous implementation of cost reduction programs, enhanced our\nprofitability by improving efficiencies and enabling us to leverage our fixed\nmanufacturing costs. Income from operations was $1.6 million during the\ncurrent quarter, compared to a virtual breakeven level for the same quarter\nlast year. We expect to build upon our improved financial performance, as we\nstrive to achieve and maintain dynamic growth and significant shareholder\nvalue."\n\n    Quarter Highlights\n    Positive Impact of Acquisition\n    On February 27, 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of\nSalisbury Engineering, Inc. ("SEI"). SEI, based in Delmar Delaware, designs\nand manufactures a full line of radio frequency and microwave components and\nsystems used primarily in military and aerospace applications. SEI\'s current\nproducts include microwave synthesizers, multiple channel filter banks and\npreselectors, and global positioning system amplifiers. These complex systems\nincorporate advance technologies and significantly expand our microwave\ncapabilities. In addition, SEI\'s microwave component offerings (miniature chip\nfilters, lumped element filters, band reject filters, cavity filters, and\nwaveguides) are a natural complement to our existing frequency control product\nofferings. The aggregate cash purchase price for SEI was approximately\n$5.6 million, including legal fees and other costs directly related to the\nacquisition. The purchase price was entirely funded through our cash reserves.\n    We have successfully integrated this acquisition into our Frequency\nControl Products Group, with SEI being accretive to our overall profitability\nwhile generating $1.1 million of shipments in the third quarter of fiscal 2004\nand total year-to-date shipments of $2.4 million.\n\n    Improved Profit Margins\n    In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, gross margin was $5.6 million or\n27.6% of sales, compared to $3.0 million or 19.6% of sales for the third\nquarter of last year. This improvement primarily reflects decreases in\nmanufacturing overhead costs, from numerous cost reduction programs, and\neconomies of scale realized with additional production and shipment volumes.\nTotal manufacturing overhead expense was $6.9 million or 34.0% of sales in the\nthird quarter of fiscal 2004, versus $6.3 million or 41.3% of sales for the\ncomparable period of 2003.\n\n    Strong Cash Flow and Liquidity\n    Our operating cash flow and liquidity remain strong. Despite increased\nworking capital requirements, net cash generated by operating activities\namounted to $6.1 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2004, an\nincrease of $821,000 or 15.6% from the comparable period a year ago. As a\nresult of increased shipments and production requirements during the first\nnine months of fiscal 2004, accounts receivable and inventories increased by\n$1.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively, excluding the impact of our SEI\nacquisition. Our total cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third\nquarter were $23.3 million, and our total borrowed funds were only\n$2.1 million.\n\n    Current Business Outlook\n    Mr. Southworth stated, "Our third quarter sales and earnings were below\nour previous expectations of $22.0 million and 12 cents per share,\nrespectively. This shortfall reflects a softening of demand experienced\nthroughout the passive components industry. Although we believe this market\nsoftening is temporary, and market conditions will improve in the fourth\nquarter and beyond, the third quarter softening illustrates the short-term\nvolatility and unpredictability of our major markets. Accordingly, we are not\nin a position to provide any specific guidance regarding our fourth quarter\nsales and profitability expectations. However as we have demonstrated in each\nquarter of the current fiscal year, we expect our fourth quarter 2004 sales\nand profitability to significantly exceed the comparable period performance of\n2003. On a long-term basis, we firmly believe that we are strategically\npositioned for strong annual sales growth and enhanced profitability," he\nconcluded.\n\n    Forward-Looking Information\n    This press release contains statements that are forward-looking statements\nwithin the meaning of the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995.
