Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\n\n         On September 13, 2004, the Company issued the press release attached to\nthis Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.01, referring to the filing of this Form 8-K and\ndescribing certain disclosures made in Item 4.02(a) as well as providing\ninformation regarding the delay in the filing of the Company\'s Form 10-K and\ncertain earnings guidance.\n\n\nItem 4.02. Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related\n           Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.\n\n     (a)\n\n         As previously reported, in October 2003, the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the "SEC") initiated an informal inquiry regarding Cardinal Health,\nInc. (the "Company"). The SEC\'s request sought historical financial and related\ninformation including but not limited to the accounting treatment of certain\nrecoveries from vitamin manufacturers. The SEC\'s request sought a variety of\ndocumentation, including the Company\'s accounting records for fiscal 2001\nthrough fiscal 2003, as well as notes, memoranda, presentations, e-mail and\nother correspondence, budgets, forecasts and estimates. In connection with the\nSEC\'s informal inquiry, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the\nCompany commenced its own internal review in April 2004, assisted by independent\ncounsel, which review has been ongoing. On May 6, 2004, the Company was notified\nthat the SEC had converted the informal inquiry into a formal investigation. On\nJune 21, 2004, as part of the SEC\'s formal investigation, the Company received\nan additional SEC subpoena that included a request for the production of\ndocuments relating to revenue classification, and the methods used for such\nclassification, in the Company\'s Pharmaceutical Distribution business as either\n"Operating Revenues" or "Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and Other." In\naddition, the Company learned that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District\nof New York had also commenced an inquiry with respect to the Company that the\nCompany understands relates to the revenue classification issue. The Company\ncontinues to respond to the SEC\'s investigation and the Audit Committee\'s\ninternal review and provide all information required.\n\n         In September 2004, the Audit Committee reached initial preliminary\nconclusions with respect to findings to date from its internal review. These\npreliminary conclusions regarding certain items that impact revenues and\nearnings relate to three primary areas of focus: (1) classification of sales to\ncustomer warehouses between "Operating Revenues" and "Bulk Deliveries to\nCustomer Warehouses and Other" within the Company\'s Pharmaceutical Distribution\nand Provider Services segment; (2) disclosure of cash discounts earned from\nsuppliers for prompt payment; and (3) balance sheet reserve and accrual\nadjustments. The Audit Committee review with respect to these and other matters\nis continuing. In connection with these preliminary conclusions, the Audit\nCommittee determined on September 11, 2004, that the financial statements of the\nCompany with respect to fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003 as well as the first three\nquarters of fiscal 2004 should be restated to reflect the preliminary\nconclusions from its internal review to date, and as such, that the financial\nstatements of the Company for such periods should no longer be relied upon. The\nAudit Committee has discussed with the Company\'s independent accountants the\nmatters disclosed in this Form 8-K filing pursuant to this Item 4.02(a). Since\nthe Audit Committee\'s internal review is not complete, there can be no assurance\nthat the restatements described in this Form 8-K will not change upon completion\nof the Audit Committee\'s internal review. In addition, as the Audit Committee\'s\ninternal review continues, new issues may surface that impact the Company\'s\nfinancial statements and the scope of the restatements described in this Form\n8-K. The impact of the restatements described below, as well as additional\nrestatements, if any, then determined to be appropriate, will be included in the\nCompany\'s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 when it is filed\nwith the SEC.\n\n         The initial preliminary conclusions of the Audit Committee from its\ninternal review to date are as follows:\n\n     1.   Revenue Impact: Classification of Sales To Customer Warehouses Between\n          "Operating Revenues" and "Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and\n          Other" Within the Company\'s Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider\n          Services Segment\n\n                  As presented historically, the Pharmaceutical Distribution and\n         Provider Services segment\'s\n\n                                      -2-\n', u'\n\n         revenue was classified into two categories ("Operating Revenues" and\n         "Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and Other"). "Bulk Deliveries\n         to Customer Warehouses and Other" have historically included revenues\n         arising from sales where the Company ordered pharmaceutical product in\n         bulk on behalf of a specific warehousing customer and either the\n         manufacturer ships the product directly to the customer\'s warehouse or\n         the product is shipped to the customer\'s warehouse shortly after it is\n         received by the Company and is not put into the Company\'s inventory (in\n         either case, "Bulk Revenues"). For all Bulk Revenues, the product is\n         shipped to the customer in the same bulk containers in which it is\n         received by the Company from the manufacturers. The Company previously\n         followed an internal policy for distinguishing between Operating\n         Revenues and Bulk Revenues based on how long the product was in the\n         Company\'s possession prior to being shipped to customers. If the\n         product was in the possession of the Company for more than 24 hours\n         prior to being shipped to customers, then, regardless of other\n         characteristics of the transaction or the reason for the product being\n         held more than 24 hours, the sale of that product was deemed to be\n         Operating Revenues. The Company\'s internal policy also provided that\n         customer orders for bulk shipments filled from inventory within the\n         Company\'s warehouse were deemed to be Operating Revenues if the order\n         for the product had been placed with the manufacturer prior to the\n         Company receiving the bulk order from its customer. Based on results of\n         the internal review conducted by the Audit Committee, the Company has\n         concluded that certain bulk shipments ordered by customers were\n         intentionally held beyond 24 hours so that, pursuant to the internal\n         policy, such shipments were classified as Operating Revenues in four\n         quarters within fiscal 2003 and 2002. The impact of this practice was\n         not previously quantified and disclosed as part of the Company\'s\n         reported Operating Revenues. The improper classification between Bulk\n         Revenues and Operating Revenues had no impact on the Company\'s total\n         revenues or reported net earnings for these periods.\n\n                  The following table shows the amount of Bulk Revenues that\n         were improperly classified as "Operating Revenues" in the manner\n         described above, and shows the impact from adjusting each of Bulk\n         Revenues and  Operating Revenues for the periods in which these\n         improper classifications occurred:\n', u'\n', u'\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                Bulk Revenues            Operating Revenues\n                                -------------            ------------------\n                          Fiscal Year Ended June 30,  Fiscal Year Ended June 30,\n(in millions)                  2003         2002        2003         2002\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u'\nFirst Quarter                $     --    $     --     $    --      $    --\nSecond Quarter                  673.0        82.0      (673.0)       (82.0)\nThird Quarter                   140.0          --      (140.0)          --\nFourth Quarter                     --       332.0          --       (332.0)\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal Year                   $  813.0    $  414.0     $(813.0)     $(414.0)\n================================================================================\n', u"\n\n\n                   Beginning with fiscal 2004, total revenues and total cost of\n         products sold will be presented as single amounts in the consolidated\n         statements of earnings.\n\n     2.  Undisclosed Earnings Impact:  Disclosure of Cash Discounts Earned From\n         Suppliers\n\n                  Historically, the Company has recognized cash discounts as a\n         reduction of cost of products sold primarily upon payment of vendor\n         invoices. Cash discounts are the discounts the Company receives from\n         some vendors for timely payment of invoices. The Company had a practice\n         of accelerating payment of vendor invoices at the end of certain\n         reporting periods in order to earn cash discounts, which had the effect\n         of increasing operating results. Although the effect of these\n         accelerated payments were included in the Company's reported earnings,\n         the impact of this acceleration practice was not separately quantified\n         and had not been previously disclosed in the periods in which the\n         Company benefited from this practice. The net increase (decrease) in\n         net earnings as a\n\n                                      -3-\n", u'\n\n\n         result of this practice for each quarter of the nine months ended March\n         31, 2004, fiscal 2003 and 2002 is as follows:\n\n', u'\n', u'\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                            Nine Months Ended\n                                 March 31,             Fiscal                 Fiscal\n(in millions)                     2004                  2003                   2002\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n', u' ', u' ', u' ', u'\nFirst Quarter           $        (0.2)         $          -           $        (3.3)\nSecond Quarter                    3.0                    2.0                     -\nThird Quarter                    (0.3)                   5.5                     -\nFourth Quarter                    N.A.                   1.3                     -\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal                   $         N.A.         $         8.8          $        (3.3)\n===========================================================================================\n', u'\n\n                  Additional information on the accounting for cash discounts\n         will be included in the Company\'s Form 10-K.\n\n3.       Restated Earnings:  Balance Sheet Reserve and Accrual Adjustments\n\n                  The Audit Committee\'s internal review included a review to\n         determine if period-end adjustments to balance sheet reserve accounts\n         and other accruals recorded in fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003 were properly\n         recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles\n         ("GAAP"). Based upon the Audit Committee\'s internal review, the Company\n         determined there were various situations where (a) amount of reserve,\n         (b) timing of reserve recognition, or (c) timing of reserve adjustments\n         could not be substantiated or was in error. As a result, the financial\n         statements for certain prior fiscal quarters and years will be restated\n         by the Company.\n\n                  The balance sheet reserves and accrual adjustments to be\n         restated consist of the following:\n\n               1.   Errors arising from misapplication of GAAP. These errors\n                    primarily include (a) reductions in reserve accounts made in\n                    periods subsequent to the period in which the excess had\n                    been identified by the Company, and (b) a LIFO inventory\n                    adjustment.\n\n               2.   Errors made in previous periods which were identified and\n                    appropriately corrected in a subsequent period when\n                    discovered. These items were not reported as prior period\n                    corrections at the time of their discovery because they were\n                    deemed immaterial. At this time, however, the Company plans\n                    to restate its prior financial statements to correct for\n                    such items identified during the internal review. This\n                    category also includes an item related to merchandising\n                    and buying margin that was determined in the fourth quarter\n                    of fiscal 2004.\n\n               3.   As a result of discussions with the SEC staff, the Company\n                    has decided to reverse its previous recognition of estimated\n                    recoveries from vitamin manufacturers for amounts\n                    overcharged in prior years and to recognize the income from\n                    such recoveries as a special item in the period cash was\n                    received from the manufacturers.

(NYSE: CAH) today submitted\na filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that provides the\ncompany with a 15-day extension to timely file its Form 10-K for fiscal year\n2004, which ended June 30.\n\nThe company also filed a Form 8-K with the SEC that provides information\nregarding the effect on the company's financial statements from an anticipated\nrestatement. The information regarding the anticipated restatement was provided\nas a result of preliminary conclusions from an ongoing internal review by the\nAudit Committee of its Board of Directors. Since the Audit Committee's\nconclusions are preliminary, there can be no assurance that the anticipated\nrestatements will not change upon completion of the Audit Committee's internal\nreview. (These initial conclusions are included in the Form 8-K, which can be\nfound at the investor relations page of www.cardinal.com).\n\n\nThe anticipated restatements are not expected to change the guidance Cardinal\nHealth provided on June 30 for its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2004.\n\nIn addition, Cardinal Health updated its guidance for fiscal year 2005. Based on\ncurrent business conditions, the company expects earnings per share to decline\nby 10 percent to 15 percent for the first half of the fiscal year, with a\ndecline of approximately 25 percent in the first quarter. This decline primarily\nreflects the ongoing business model transition in Cardinal Health's\npharmaceutical distribution segment. Margin pressures in this business are\nexpected to continue as pharmaceutical price increases slow from historic levels\nand Cardinal Health transitions to a new fee-based compensation model for the\ndistribution services it provides pharmaceutical manufacturers. Margin pressure\non medical products and delays in the start-up and associated costs of new\nsterile manufacturing projects are also expected to contribute to the first-half\nearnings decline.\n\n\n                                     -more-\n", u'\nCARDINAL HEALTH DELAYS FILING FISCAL YEAR-END RESULTS, FORM 8-K DISCLOSES\nANTICIPATED RESTATEMENT\nPAGE 2\n\nCardinal Health has initiated strategic and operational actions to improve\nlong-term results, including a restructuring program targeting cost structure\nimprovements of $125 million in fiscal year 2005, with greater annual savings\nover a three-year period. Cardinal Health maintains an earnings-per-share growth\ngoal of at least 10 percent for fiscal year 2005. Achievement of this goal,\nhowever, is dependent on operational progress and improvements, most notably in\nits pharmaceutical distribution business.\n\nAs previously reported, in October 2003, the SEC initiated an informal inquiry\nregarding Cardinal Health seeking historical financial and related information.\nIn May, the company was notified that the SEC had converted the informal inquiry\ninto a formal investigation. In June, as part of the SEC\'s formal investigation,\nCardinal Health received an SEC subpoena that included a request for the\nproduction of documents relating to revenue classification, and the methods used\nfor such classification, in the company\'s Pharmaceutical Distribution business\nas either "Operating Revenues" or "Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and\nOther." In addition, the company learned that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern\nDistrict of New York had also commenced an inquiry that the company understands\nrelates to the revenue classification issue. Cardinal Health continues to\nrespond to the investigations by providing all information required.\n\nAn investor meeting scheduled for Sept. 15 has been postponed. The company plans\nto reschedule the meeting on a date following the filing of its Form 10-K.\n\nABOUT CARDINAL HEALTH\n\nCARDINAL HEALTH, INC.
