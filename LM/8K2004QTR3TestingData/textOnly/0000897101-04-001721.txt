RECORD\n      $1.4 BILLION SALES; STRONG BACKLOGS SUPPORT OUTLOOK FOR DOUBLE-DIGIT\n                      EARNINGS GROWTH AGAIN IN FISCAL 2005\n\n         MINNEAPOLIS, August 31, 2004 -- Donaldson Company, Inc. (NYSE: DCI),\ntoday reported diluted earnings per share of $0.29 for the fourth fiscal quarter\nended July 31, 2004, unchanged from last year. Net income was $26.2 million,\ncompared to $27.1 million last year. Sales were a record $384.0 million, up from\n$330.3 million last year.\n         For the year, diluted earnings per share were a record $1.18, compared\nto $1.05 last year. Net income totaled a record $106.3 million, compared to\n$95.3 million last year. Record sales of $1.415 billion compared to $1.218\nbillion last year.\n            "Our fourth quarter was marked by three substantial expense\nadjustments," said Bill Cook, Donaldson\'s president and chief executive officer.\n"The cumulative impact of these unusual expenses in the quarter was $11.6\nmillion or $0.08 per share. Obviously, these expenses had a significant impact\non our quarterly results and kept a very good fourth quarter from being another\nnet income record; however, we felt that it was fiscally prudent to make these\nadjustments now given the facts as we see them."\n         The adjustments in the fourth quarter that reduced pre-tax income by\n$11.6 million are as follows:\n\n\n                                     (more)\n\n', u'\n\nDonaldson Company, Inc.\nAugust 31, 2004\nPage 2\n\n\no        On August 12, the U.S. Federal District Court ruled that damages\n         against Donaldson in the previously disclosed patent infringement\n         lawsuit brought by Engineered Products Company, Inc. should be\n         approximately $16 million. While we intend to vigorously challenge the\n         judgment and will appeal the decision to the Federal Circuit Court of\n         Appeals, we increased our reserve for this matter by $5.0 million.\n\no        As a result of ongoing discussions on a specific warranty-related\n         matter, we increased our warranty reserve by $3.0 million.\n\no        During our year-end closing process, we identified an adjustment of\n         $3.6 million relating to a fiscal 2003 transaction between several\n         Ultrafilter entities.\n\n          "Coupled with strong sales growth again this quarter, our results\nwould have been very strong without the matters discussed above," said Cook. "We\nbegan recovering last quarter\'s steel price increases and worked hard to bring\nour operating expense run-rate back down to prior year levels. Net of the\nmatters discussed above, the fourth quarter numbers show a solid gross margin\nand operating expenses below the target level we discussed during the third\nquarter webcast."\n         "The good news is that broad strength across most of our end markets\nand our ability to capitalize on it drove record earnings in fiscal 2004. We\nhave transitioned from three years of weak conditions in many of our end markets\nto rapid demand acceleration this year, and the Donaldson people responded by\nramping up operations quickly to capture the opportunity."\n\n         Factors contributing to the quarter include:\n\no        Strong Engine Products results.\n\n         >>       North American truck build rates again increased significantly\n                  and off-road equipment markets strengthened.\n\n         >>       Equipment utilization improved in both the truck and off-road\n                  markets, spurring aftermarket parts sales growth.\n\n         >>       North American regulations at both federal and state levels\n                  continue to create strong demand for our diesel truck emission\n                  control products.\n\n\n                                     (more)\n', u'\n\nDonaldson Company, Inc.\nAugust 31, 2004\nPage 3\n\n\n         >>       Finally, our European and Asian businesses experienced strong\n                  demand for both truck and off-road equipment filters.\n\no        Continued solid demand for disk drive filters. Our disk drive filter\n         business remained strong, delivering another quarter of over 20 percent\n         sales growth as demand for computer hard drives remained high.\n\no        Improving conditions for gas turbine. Gas turbine grew sales for the\n         first time in eight quarters.\n\n         "Despite the operating leverage realized from higher production\nvolumes, gross margin was down from last year due to the impact of the\naforementioned expense adjustments and steel price increases," said Cook. "We\nbegan recovering a significant portion of last quarter\'s steel price increases\nduring the quarter, but saw another round of steel price increases which will\nrequire additional price recovery from our customers."\n\nINCOME STATEMENT DISCUSSION\n         The impact of foreign currency translation during the fourth quarter,\nled by the Euro, increased sales by $9.4 million and net earnings by $0.7\nmillion. For the year, currency translation increased sales by $70.0 million and\nnet earnings by $4.7 million. Worldwide sales, excluding the impact of currency\ntranslation, increased 13.4 percent during the quarter and 10.4 percent for the\nyear.\n         Excluding the impact of currency translation, fourth quarter sales\noutside the U.S. increased 9.3 percent, primarily reflecting strong sales growth\nin Asia. For the year, excluding the impact of currency translation, sales\noutside the U.S. increased 11.1 percent.\n         Gross margin of 31.3 percent for the quarter compared to 32.5 percent\nlast year. For the year, gross margin was 31.8 percent, compared to 32.1 percent\nlast year. Steel price increases offset the operating leverage gained from\nhigher production volumes. We recovered a significant portion of the third\nquarter\'s steel price increases this quarter, but another round of steel price\nincreases experienced in the fourth quarter will require additional price\nrecovery from our customers. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by $2.3\nmillion from the intercompany\n\n                                     (more)\n\n', u'\n\nDonaldson Company, Inc.\nAugust 31, 2004\nPage 4\n\nmatter discussed above. There were no plant rationalization costs in the quarter\nversus $0.02 last year. For the year, plant rationalization costs were $0.05 per\nshare, unchanged from last year.\n         Fourth quarter operating expenses were 22.6 percent of sales, up from\n21.2 percent last year. For the year, operating expenses as a percent of sales\nwere 22.2 percent, up from 21.3 percent last year. Included in fourth quarter\noperating expenses were the following adjustments: a $5.0 million increase to\nour reserve for the patent infringement judgment; a $3.0 million increase to our\nwarranty reserve; and $1.3 million from the intercompany matter discussed above.\n         Fourth quarter interest expense was $1.3 million, flat with last year.\nFor the year, interest expense was $5.0 million versus $5.9 million last year.\nOther income was $2.5 million in the quarter, up from $1.3 million last year,\ndriven by a small foreign exchange gain versus a loss last year and higher\ninterest income. For the year, other income was $5.2 million, compared to $4.7\nmillion last year.\n         The tax rates of 24.2 percent for the quarter and 25.0 percent for the\nyear compare to prior year tax rates of 27.0 percent for both the quarter and\nthe year. The decrease in the quarter reflects the increased contribution from\nour international operations. We expect the tax rate to return to approximately\n27 percent in fiscal 2005.\n         During the quarter, we repurchased 281,000 shares for $7.6 million as\npart of our ongoing share repurchase plan. For the year, 1,071,000 shares, or\n1.2 percent of outstanding shares, were repurchased for a total of $29.8\nmillion.\n\nBACKLOG\n         The 90-day backlog, reflecting continued strong demand in the upcoming\nquarter, was $209 million, up 14 percent, or $26 million, relative to last year.\nIn Engine Products, the 90-day backlog increased 13 percent over last year. In\nIndustrial Products, the 90-day backlog increased 15 percent. Notably, the\nworldwide industrial air filtration 90-day backlog increased 32 percent.\n         Total backlog was $376 million, up 20 percent, or $62 million, relative\nto last year. In Engine Products, total backlog increased 28 percent from last\nyear.

We expect that increasing commodity prices, especially steel,\nwill be mostly offset by price increases and improving manufacturing\nefficiencies from continued strong volume.

Free cash flow is a commonly used\nmeasure of a company's ability to generate cash in excess of its operating\nneeds. EBITDA is a commonly used measure of operating earnings less non-cash\nexpenses. Both net sales and net earnings excluding foreign currency translation\nprovide a comparable measure for understanding the operating results of the\ncompany's foreign entities excluding the impact of foreign exchange. A\nshortcoming of these financial measures is that they do not reflect the\ncompany's actual results under GAAP. Management does not intend these items to\nbe considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures.\n\n                                      # # #\n\n\n", u'\n', u'\n', u'\n-----END PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE-----\n']
