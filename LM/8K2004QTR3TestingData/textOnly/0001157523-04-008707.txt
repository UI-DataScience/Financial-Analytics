(NYSE:SCS) today reported revenue totaling $651.0 million for its\nsecond quarter ended August 27, 2004. Revenue for this quarter\nincreased 6.4 percent compared to $612.1 million in the prior year\nquarter and was up 8.9 percent sequentially from the first quarter of\nfiscal 2005. Revenue was in line with company estimates.\n    Revenue included $21.0 million of sales from dealers consolidated\nin fiscal 2005 and $8.3 million from the impact of the steel surcharge\nimplemented in North America during the first quarter. The second\nquarter also benefited by $8.6 million from favorable currency\ntranslation effects in the company\'s International segment compared to\nlast year.\n    Steelcase reported net income of $7.3 million, or $0.05 per share,\nfor the second quarter of fiscal 2005, better than company estimates\nof breakeven to $(0.05) per share. This compares to a net loss from\ncontinuing operations of $(3.2) million, or $(0.02) per share in the\nsame quarter of the prior year. Prior year net income of $18.1 million\nincluded a $21.3 million after-tax gain on discontinued operations\nrelated to the sale of Attwood.\n    Reported results included net restructuring charges totaling\n$(1.4) million after-tax. These charges were favorable compared to\ncompany estimates of $(3) to (7) million because of lower than\nanticipated restructuring charges for activities completed during the\nquarter, and a change in timing for other restructuring activities\nfrom the second quarter to the second half of the year.\n    The company improved gross margins by 2.6 percentage points to\n30.0 percent compared to 27.4 percent in the same quarter last year.\nProductivity gains, benefits of previous restructuring activities,\nreduced restructuring costs and continued cost containment contributed\nto better-than-expected gross margin performance.\n    Steelcase also reduced operating expenses as a percent of sales to\n27.3 percent from 27.7 percent in the prior year and 28.6 percent in\nthe first quarter. This improvement was related to continued cost\ncontrol, higher sales volume and, because some project spending\noriginally expected during the second quarter has shifted to the\nsecond half of the year. Operating expenses increased in absolute\ndollars compared to the prior year, because of newly consolidated\ndealers, increased variable compensation accruals, and unfavorable\ncurrency translation effects.\n    All business segments improved profitability in the quarter\ncompared to the prior year. Steelcase reported net income of $1.6\nmillion year-to-date.\n    "I am pleased with the profitable growth the Steelcase team\ndelivered this quarter," said James P. Hackett, president and CEO. "We\nare seeing benefits from our multi-year restructuring effort, improved\nproductivity from lean manufacturing initiatives, and top-line growth\nfrom our larger customers and in key vertical markets."\n    Steelcase increased cash balances by $34.2 million and lowered\ndebt by $2.2 million compared to the first quarter. Higher net income\nand improved net working capital performance generated operating cash\nflow in the second quarter.\n    "Steelcase returned to profitability this quarter through\nimprovements in gross margins as well as continued operating expense\ncontrol," said James P. Keane, chief financial officer. "Because of\nthe sustained efforts of Steelcase employees, we delivered our highest\nlevel of income from continuing operations in six quarters. At the\nsame time, we strengthened our balance sheet by increasing cash and\nreducing debt during the quarter."\n\n    Outlook\n\n    North American order rates continue to increase, but at a slower\nrate than the company experienced earlier in the year. This is\nconsistent with indications that the U.S. economic recovery slowed\nduring the summer. Major international markets are not yet showing\nclear signs of meaningful recovery.\n    Steelcase expects third quarter revenue to be up 4 to 8 percent\nfrom the prior year, including approximately $25 million of revenue\nfrom the newly consolidated dealers and $8 million from the impact of\nthe steel surcharge. On a sequential quarter basis, the company\nexpects third quarter revenue to be similar to the second quarter.\n    The company expects third quarter performance to be negatively\nimpacted by competitive price pressures and broad increases in raw\nmaterials prices. For example, steel prices continue to rise and the\nincrease in the cost of steel is expected to be more than the amount\nthe company\'s previously announced steel surcharge will recover.\n    Steelcase expects to report earnings between breakeven and $0.05\nper share including anticipated restructuring charges of $(1) to $(3)\nmillion after-tax in the third quarter.\n    Mr. Hackett concluded, "During the recovery, we have many more\nopportunities to provide new and existing customers with a better work\nexperience. We are continuing to improve productivity within the\ncompany while reducing excess capacity, which is helping to improve\ngross margins. However, we are also facing new challenges such as\nrising steel, energy and healthcare costs, and other factors that put\nadditional pressure on the economic recovery, and on our margins. I am\nvery proud of the commitment of all our people to respond to these\nopportunities and challenges, and to help Steelcase sustain profitable\ngrowth."\n\n    Webcast\n\n    Steelcase will webcast its conference call reviewing second\nquarter financial results today at 11:00 a.m. EDT.
