Highlights include:\n\n   -  The Company achieved strong top-line growth in the third quarter of\n      2004 with total revenues of $1.75 billion, up 21% from $1.44 billion\n      posted in 2003. Housing revenues increased 24% to $1.72 billion in the\n      quarter, driven by higher unit deliveries which rose 17% to 8,041 units\n      and a 5% increase in the average selling price to $214,400.\n\n   -  Substantial earnings growth in the quarter was driven by higher unit\n      volume and the expansion of the Company's construction operating margin.\n      Net income for the third quarter of 2004 totaled $117.9 million,\n      increasing 20% from $97.8 million in the third quarter of 2003. The\n      Company's diluted earnings per share increased to $2.84 for the three\n      months ended August 31, 2004, up 22% from $2.33 for the three months ended\n      August 31, 2003.\n\n   -  Company-wide net orders for the third quarter increased 23% to 8,982,\n      up from 7,319 net orders reported for the same quarter of 2003.\n      Year-over-year net order growth was driven by higher net orders from each\n      of the Company's geographic regions. Recent acquisitions and de novo\n      growth have significantly expanded the Company's territory in the Central\n      and Southeast regions and set the stage for continued net order momentum.\n\n   -  Backlog at August 31, 2004, in terms of both units and dollars, was the\n      highest of any quarter-end in the Company's history. The dollar value of\n      backlog at August 31, 2004 totaled approximately $4.82 billion, up 42%\n      from August 31, 2003, and represents a strong pipeline of future revenues\n      for the remainder of 2004 and into 2005. The Company's unit backlog at\n      August 31, 2004 stood at 21,928, an increase of 5,356 units or 32% from\n      16,572 units at August 31, 2003.\n\n   -  The Company's favorable financial performance through the first nine\n      months of 2004 and positive outlook\n\n                                       5\n", u'\n\n      for the remainder of the year and 2005 have prompted an increase in\n      expected earnings to $11.00 per diluted share for 2004 from the Company\'s\n      previous estimate. This represents an increase of 25% from the $8.80\n      earnings per diluted share generated in 2003. The Company also issued\n      initial earnings guidance for 2005 of $14.00 per diluted share, a 27%\n      increase over the forecasted 2004 diluted earnings per share.\n\n            "The strength of KB Home\'s third quarter net income and earnings per\nshare is the direct result of our excellent top-line growth in unit deliveries\nand revenues combined with the expansion of our margins," said Bruce Karatz,\nchairman and chief executive officer. "The performance of our core homebuilding\nbusiness also benefited from our geographic diversity and growing wide-array of\nattached and detached product offerings, appealing to first-time and move-up\nhomebuyers, as well as active adults and luxury buyers. As current market\nconditions remained solid and supported the underlying fundamental demand for\nhousing, unit deliveries in nearly all of our geographic regions exceeded prior\nyear results in the third quarter. We anticipate this performance to continue in\nthe fourth quarter, delivering outstanding results for the full year."\n\n            Total revenues for the third quarter of 2004 rose to $1.75 billion,\nup 21% from $1.44 billion in the third quarter of 2003. Housing revenues\nincreased 24% in the period to $1.72 billion, up from $1.39 billion in the\nyear-earlier period as a result of increases in both unit volume and average\nselling prices. Unit deliveries rose 17% to 8,041 in the third quarter of 2004\nfrom 6,850 in the same quarter of 2003. The Company\'s overall average selling\nprice rose 5% to $214,400 in 2004 from $203,600 in 2003. Year-over-year growth\nin the Company\'s average selling price reflected increases in all of its\ndomestic geographic regions.\n\n            "Our strategic investments in markets across the country over the\npast several quarters have laid the necessary groundwork for achieving our\nlong-term growth goals," Karatz said. "We fully expect these investments to\ntranslate into higher community counts, revenues and earnings in the future.\nDemand for new homes should remain healthy as we expect the nation\'s economy to\nimprove, consumer confidence to increase, household incomes to rise, and\nfavorable demographic trends to continue to drive new household formations.\nBased on both our ability to deliver a rising number of new homes and our\nassessment of likely market conditions for the remainder of this year and into\n2005, we have increased our earnings estimate for 2004 to $11.00 per diluted\nshare and are forecasting a 27% increase in earnings to $14.00 per diluted share\nfor 2005."\n\n            Construction operating income rose to $190.8 million in the third\nquarter of 2004, a 39% increase from $137.3 million in the year-earlier quarter.\nThe improvement was largely due to higher unit volume and an expanded operating\nmargin. The Company\'s housing gross margin increased 130 basis points to 24.1%\nfor the three months ended August 31, 2004, up from 22.8% for the same period of\n2003 primarily due to the favorable pricing environment as well as operating\nefficiencies achieved. The Company\'s construction operating margin increased to\n11.0% in the third quarter of 2004 from 9.7% in the third quarter of 2003. Net\nincome rose to an all-time third quarter high of $117.9 million in 2004, up 20%\nfrom $97.8 million in the third quarter of 2003.\n\n            "KB Home\'s operating margin exhibited substantial growth in the\nthird quarter primarily as a result of a higher housing gross margin," Karatz\nsaid. "We have leveraged the increase in our revenues by managing our costs in\naccordance with our operational business model to drive margin growth. Our\nsuccess in quickly and effectively integrating recently acquired businesses also\ncontributed to the improved profit margin."\n\n            The Company\'s backlog value totaled approximately $4.82 billion at\nAugust 31, 2004, a 42% increase compared to $3.40 billion at August 31, 2003.\nTotal backlog units at August 31, 2004 rose 32% year-over-year to\n\n                                       6\n', u'\n\n21,928 units reflecting increases in all geographic regions in which the Company\noperates. This backlog growth resulted from a 23% increase in net orders for the\nquarter ended August 31, 2004 to 8,982, up from the 7,319 net orders posted for\nthe same quarter of 2003. All geographic regions generated favorable\nyear-over-year comparisons.\n\n            "Net order activity during the third quarter increased significantly\nfrom the prior year quarter and drove the tremendous increase in our backlog\nwhich represents future revenues," Karatz said. "With a record third quarter\nbacklog supporting our projections for the remainder of 2004, we operate from a\ngreat vantage point as we move forward. Furthermore, as of quarter end we owned\nor controlled a diverse inventory pipeline comprised of more than 160,000 lots\nin attractive markets across the United States, which further enhances our\noptimism for the longer-term in this land-constrained environment."\n\n            During the first nine months of 2004, the Company delivered 21,361\nhomes, up 16% from the 18,457 delivered in the first nine months of 2003. Total\nrevenues for the first three quarters of 2004 reached $4.67 billion, up 17% from\n$3.98 billion in the first three quarters of 2003. The Company\'s construction\noperating margin improved 150 basis points to 10.3% for the nine months ended\nAugust 31, 2004 and fueled a 27% increase in net income to $294.2 million from\n$232.0 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2003. Diluted earnings per\nshare for the first three quarters of 2004 set a new Company record of $6.98,\nadvancing 27% from the prior record of $5.51 per share in the same period of\n2003.\n\nTHE CONFERENCE CALL ON THE THIRD QUARTER 2004 EARNINGS WILL BE BROADCAST LIVE\nTOMORROW AT 8:00 A.M.
