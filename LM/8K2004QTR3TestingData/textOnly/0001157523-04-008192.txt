RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\n         On August 31, 2004, Zale Corporation issued a press release reporting\nits financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and year ended July 31,\n2004. A copy of the press release is hereby furnished as Exhibit 99.1 and\nincorporated herein by reference.\n\n         The attached press release includes a presentation of earnings and\nearnings per share, for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2003, that excludes\ncosts associated with redeeming the Company\'s senior notes in the fourth quarter\nof fiscal year 2003. In addition, the attached press release includes a\npresentation of earnings and earnings per share, for the fiscal year ended July\n31, 2003, that excludes the senior note redemption costs as well as a non-cash\ngoodwill impairment charge incurred during the second quarter of fiscal year\n2003. Such measures are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and\nshould not be considered as alternatives to net earnings and earnings per share\nas computed under GAAP for the applicable period. The Company considers net\nearnings and earnings per share to be the most comparable GAAP measures and has\npresented reconciling information in the first and second paragraphs of the\npress release.\n\n         The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are\nhelpful, when presented in conjunction with the comparable GAAP measures.\nManagement uses earnings measures adjusted to exclude the charges as part of its\nevaluation of the performance of the Company. Further, the Company believes\nthese measures provide useful information to investors because the charges\nexcluded relate to events that resulted in a significant impact during the\nsecond and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2003 and will recur with unpredictable\nfrequency. Non-cash goodwill impairment charges may occur in the future, as the\nCompany reviews its goodwill each year under SFAS 142; however, such charges\nwill vary in size and frequency. Unusual financing charges, such as the costs\nassociated with redeeming the senior notes, occur more regularly in the\nCompany\'s business, but vary in size and frequency.\n\n         In addition, the attached press release includes a presentation of\n"free operating cash flow." Free operating cash flow is a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure and is defined as cash flows from operating activities (in accordance\nwith GAAP) less net capital expenditures. The Company considers cash flows from\noperating activities to be the most comparable GAAP financial measure, and has\nincluded in the press release a reconciliation of cash flows from operating\nactivities to free operating cash flow.\n\n         The Company believes the presentation of free operating cash flow\npresents useful information about the amount of cash generated from operations\nafter making capital investments to support growth initiatives. Free operating\ncash flow should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from\noperating, financing or investing activities or as a measure of liquidity.\nFurther, free operating cash flow does not represent the total increase or\ndecrease in the cash balance for the period. Readers are encouraged to review\nthe Statement of Cash Flows included in the attached press release for\ninformation regarding the Company\'s cash flows from operating, financing and\ninvesting activities under GAAP.\n\n         The information set forth under this Item 2.02 is being furnished and\nshall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by\nreference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as\nshall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.\n\n\n', u'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                  EXHIBIT INDEX\n\n99.1              Press Release of Zale Corporation issued August 31, 2004.\n\n', u'\n\n\n                                   SIGNATURES\n\n         Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nthe Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the\nundersigned hereunto duly authorized.\n\n\n\n\nZALE CORPORATION\n- ----------------\nRegistrant\n\n\nDate:    August 31, 2004                  By: /s/ Cynthia T.

for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004. Free operating cash\nflow is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as cash provided\nby operating activities (in accordance with GAAP) less net capital\nexpenditures. The Company considers cash provided by operating\nactivities to be the most comparable GAAP financial measure, and has\nincluded below a reconciliation of cash flows from operating\nactivities to free operating cash flow.\n\n\n            Reconciliation of Free Operating Cash Flows To\n                 Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n                        (amounts in thousands)\n\n                                   For the Fiscal Year Ended\n                           July 31, 2004  July 31, 2003  July 31, 2002\n\nCash flows from operating\n activities                     $178,078       $164,820      $178,915\n\nLess: Capital expenditures        60,788         43,579        54,159\n                           -------------- -------------- -------------\n\nFree operating cash flow        $117,290       $121,241      $124,756\n\n\n    Free operating cash flow should not be considered as an\nalternative to cash flows from operating, financing or investing\nactivities or as a measure of liquidity. Further, free operating cash\nflow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash\nbalance for the period. Readers are encouraged to review the Statement\nof Cash Flows included in this press release for information regarding\nthe Company\'s cash flows from operating, financing and investing\nactivities under GAAP.\n    In addition, management has presented a projection of free\noperating cash flow of approximately $100 million for fiscal year\n2005. This projection is based on projected cash provided by operating\nactivities of approximately $180 million for fiscal year 2005, less\nprojected net capital expenditures of approximately $80 million for\nfiscal year 2005. Such projections represent management\'s current\nexpectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties\nthat could cause actual amounts to differ materially from these\nprojections. Please refer to the "Notice Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements" included in this press release.\n    In addition, this press release includes a presentation of\nearnings (and earnings per share), excluding certain unusual items\n(Senior Notes redemption charges and a non-cash goodwill impairment\ncharge), for fiscal year 2003 and for the fourth quarter of fiscal\nyear 2003. Such measures are not measures of financial performance\nunder GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net\nearnings (and earnings per share) as computed under GAAP for the\napplicable period. The impact of each unusual item is shown net of\ntaxes.\n\n    CONTACT: Zale Corporation\n             David H.
