First quarter operating income totaled\n$2.4 million compared with an operating loss of $2.9 million in the\nfirst quarter of fiscal 2004. The company reported first quarter net\nincome of $1.2 million, or $0.09 per share, versus a first quarter net\nloss of $1.9 million, or $0.15 per share. Gross margin of 29.6 percent\nimproved from 28.1 percent one year ago.\n    During the quarter, Norstan sold the assets and intellectual\nproperty related to Norstan CDG to IPcelerate, Inc., a privately held\ndeveloper of Voice over IP (VoIP) applications, for $2.5 million in\ncash and promissory notes, and the assumption by the purchaser of\napproximately $400,000 in liabilities. Pursuant to the terms of the\npurchase agreement, the company received $1.25 million at closing and\n$1.25 million evidenced by non-interest promissory notes in favor of\nNorstan ($1.05 million due January 30, 2005 and $200,000 due February\n28, 2005). Norstan recorded a pre-tax gain of $88,000 from the sale in\nthe first quarter of fiscal 2005. The company believes it can continue\nto offer its customers access to VoIP applications without the\ndevelopment expenses associated with the on-going operations of the\nCDG business.\n    "We are pleased with our first quarter performance," said Scott G.\nChristian, Norstan\'s president and CEO. "While our revenues were down\nmodestly over last year, the quality of our revenues has improved, as\nreflected in higher gross margins. Our efforts to properly size our\nbusiness have continued to improve results; our operating\nprofitability has strengthened and cash flow has improved steadily."\n    The company\'s expense structure continued to improve in the first\nquarter of fiscal 2005. SG&A expenses decreased 3.1 percent\nsequentially and 27.2 percent year-over-year as a result of the\ncompany\'s fiscal 2004 restructuring initiatives. This significant\nreduction in spending was somewhat offset by the recording of $1.5\nmillion in incentive compensation costs accrued during the first\nquarter of fiscal 2005.\n    EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization) from continuing operations for the first quarter of\nfiscal 2005 totaled $4.3 million, an improvement from negative EBITDA\nof $691,000 reported in the first quarter of last year. Sequentially,\nEBITDA remained steady as compared to the $4.4 million reported in the\nfourth quarter of fiscal 2004, excluding restructuring and other\ncharges.\n\n    Sequential Results\n\n    First quarter fiscal 2005 revenues declined modestly from the\n$57.5 million reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Gross\nmargin totaled 29.6 percent compared to the 29.2 percent reported last\nquarter. Operating income of $2.4 million showed significant\nimprovement from the $6.8 million operating loss reported last\nquarter. Net income also improved from the $4.6 million loss, or $0.35\nper share, reported last quarter. Norstan recorded $9.4 million in\npre-tax restructuring and other charges during the fourth quarter of\nfiscal 2004.\n\n    Fiscal 2005 Outlook\n\n    Norstan\'s management believes it prudent not to provide\nforward-looking financial guidance for fiscal 2005. However, as the\ncompany\'s strategic focus has changed from one of higher revenue\nthrough aggressive growth, Norstan is focusing in fiscal 2005 on\nprofitability through several initiatives, such as improving gross\nmargins, delivering advanced business applications, driving additional\nsales to its existing customer base, selectively developing new\nbusiness in certain technologies and continued development of our\nResale Services business. This change in strategic focus may result in\nlower revenues but deliver higher profitability and cash flow in\nfiscal 2005 than in fiscal 2004.\n\n    Conference Call and Webcast\n\n    Norstan will discuss its first quarter fiscal year results on a\nconference call scheduled today, September 7, at 5 p.m. Eastern time.\nThe conference call can be accessed toll-free by callers at (888)\n333-4519 or on the Internet at www.norstan.com.
