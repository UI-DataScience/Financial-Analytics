performance\nin the retail industry. EBITDA is provided to enhance an investor's\nunderstanding of our operating results. It should not be construed as an\nalternative to operating income as an indicator of operating performance or as\nan alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity\nas determined in accordance with GAAP. All companies do not calculate EBITDA in\nthe same manner. As a result, EBITDA as reported may not be comparable to EBITDA\nas reported by other companies.\n\n\n", u'\n', u'\n', u'\n-----END PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE-----\n']
