(OTCBB:SOFT -\nNEWS), a leading provider of design-through-manufacturing productivity\nsolutions, announced today results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2004.\nRevenue for Q4 was about $3.3 million as compared to about $3.6 million for the\nsame period in the prior year. The net loss for Q4 2004 was $(384,000) or $(.03)\nper share as compared to a net loss of $(613,000) or $(.05) per share for the\nprior year. Free Cash Flow (as defined below) for Q4 2004 was $256,000 as\ncompared to $(97,000) for the same period in fiscal 2003. Free Cash Flow is\ndefined as the net loss calculated on a GAAP basis plus non-cash amortization\nand depreciation minus capital expenditures. A reconciliation of GAAP results to\nFree Cash Flow for each of the periods is presented in a table below.\n\nRevenue for fiscal year 2004 was about $12.3 million as compared to about $10.7\nmillion for fiscal year 2003. The net loss for fiscal 2004 was about $(1.9)\nmillion for each of fiscal 2004 and 2003. The Free Cash Flow for fiscal 2004 was\n$692,000 as compared to $284,000 in fiscal 2003.\n\n"Fiscal 2004 represented our third consecutive year of positive Free Cash Flow,"\nsaid Joe Mullaney, SofTech\'s President. "We continued to improve on most\nmeasures of financial performance despite a very uneven economic recovery in the\nworldwide manufacturing sector. Our pipeline of identified new business has\ncontinued to grow over the last year although it has been difficult to predict\nor greatly influence exactly when those customers will make their final purchase\ndecisions.\n\nOur outlook for the full fiscal year 2005 is for continued improvement on the\nexcellent foundation we have built over the last three years although the uneven\nlicense revenue order flow from quarter to quarter is expected to continue. We\nhave an exceptional customer base for our Cadra, ProductCenter and our CAM\nfamily of products throughout the U.S., Western Europe and Japan and we will\ncontinue to serve their needs while targeting growth opportunities. All of our\nproducts compete in the Product Lifecycle Management ("PLM") market.\n\nOne particular growth opportunity we have identified relates to our\nProductCenter technology. ProductCenter is a well established technology that\ncontrols product information and allows for the sharing of that information\nthroughout an extended enterprise. Our customers include some of the largest\n\n', u'\n\ndesign and manufacturing companies in the world. This portion of the PLM market\nis expected to experience double-digit growth over the next several years.\n\nOur distinct advantage relative to our competition is that we believe\nProductCenter is, by far, the most affordable, full-featured, data management\nand collaboration offering on the market. It can be put into production within a\nfour to six week period without significant customization. It is especially\napplicable to multi-CAD environments.\n\nThe continued migration of 2D computer-aided-design users to mid-range 3D, solid\nmodeling tools will increase the need to manage product information with\ntechnologies such as ProductCenter. It is my view that ProductCenter is very\nwell positioned to capture more than its share of these users," Mullaney added.\n\nABOUT SOFTECH\nSofTech, Inc.
