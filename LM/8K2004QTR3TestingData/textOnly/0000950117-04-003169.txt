Net sales for the fourth quarter Fiscal 2004 rose 17% to $5,641,132 as\ncompared to $4,841,458 for Fiscal 2003. Revenues for the twelve months, just\nended, were $19,832,910 compared to $18,043,668 for Fiscal 2003, a 10% annual\ngrowth rate.\n\nThe twelve months Fiscal 2004 resulted in a profit of $1,345,467 or $.15 per\nbasic share, a record level over the past six years, compared to a loss of\n($1,515,407) or ($.16) per basic share in Fiscal 2003. The current quarter had a\nprofit of $407,456 or $.04 per basic share compared to a profit of $98,188 or\n$.01 per basic share in Fiscal 2003. The Company\'s balance sheet is\nsignificantly enhanced as a result of improving profitability, cash flow and\nsubstantial reductions in both short and long term debt. Included in the prior\nloss in Fiscal 2003 was a charge of $1,297,069 related to a change in accounting\nprinciple, which required the write-off of any remaining goodwill.\n\nDavid Vozick, Chairman said, "The Company\'s profitable performance this year, is\na continuation of a very positive trend. This has been our most profitable\nyear-end report over the past six years, as a result of implementing a sound\nbusiness strategy. We look forward to continuing our growth in profitable sales\nby putting our engineering efforts and other marketing resources into providing\na new family of digital radiographic products (DR) to dental, medical and\nveterinary practitioners. The professional acceptance of AFP\'s product line that\nutilizes electronic x-ray sensors and computers for capturing, presenting and\nstoring radiographic images will offer the Company ample opportunities for\ncontinued growth. The Company\'s investment in research and development during\nthe past few years is now paying its dividend. Management continues to evaluate\na wide range of complementary product acquisitions."\n\n"In the fourth quarter, AFP continued to expand its marketing strategy. We have\nattended and exhibited at important national and regional dental and veterinary\ntrade shows. The Company believes that it is critical to maintain a presence at\nthese widely attended clinical shows, to promote new products and to provide a\nsales base for our independent dealers and ultimate professional users. The key\nopportunity in the Company\'s business plan is to be an industry leader, in our\nproduct sectors, in the ongoing conversion from analog to digital radiographic\nimaging systems. Over the past twenty-five years, we have built a very\nsignificant installed base of equipment which are the most logical and best\ncandidates for upgrading to new technologies."\n\n"In addition to building the digital dental sensor product line, AFP began in\n2004 to distribute a laser based, computed radiographic (CR) system, designed\nfor whole body, diagnostic veterinary applications. This system provides high\nimage quality and excellent optical density using a re-usable phosphorus plate\ninstead of x-ray film. Images captured and scanned are displayed and shared on a\ncomputer workstation and then can be erased from the plate before re-use. The\nnext logical step will be for the Company to introduce this product into the\nhuman diagnostic x-ray market."\n\nAFP Imaging is a medical equipment supplier whose imaging products are widely\napplied in dental and medical diagnostics. The Company\'s new products and\nimaging technology are providing the gateway for future growth. Medical, dental,\nveterinary and industrial professionals use AFP\'s products. The Company\'s\nproducts include x-ray units, digital x-ray sensors, film processors, chemistry,\nand panoramic units. The Company\'s products are sold worldwide under various\nbrand names, which include AFP, DENT-X, and EVA\'r\'.
