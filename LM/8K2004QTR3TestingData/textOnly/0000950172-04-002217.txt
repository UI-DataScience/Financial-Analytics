Revenues increased 1.8 percent.\n\nSame store sales increased 2.0 percent during the second quarter as compared to\nthe year-ago like period, consisting of a 2.1 percent pharmacy same store sales\nincrease and a 1.8 percent increase in front-end same store sales. Prescription\nsales accounted for 63.9 percent of total sales, and third party prescription\nsales represented 93.3 percent of pharmacy sales.\n\nNet income for the second quarter increased to $9.8 million or $.00 per diluted\nshare compared to last year's second quarter net loss of $10.6 million or a\n$.04 loss per diluted share. The improvement was due primarily to an $18.3\nmillion or 12.0 percent increase in adjusted EBITDA (which is reconciled to net\nincome on the attached table) and an $11.0 million reduction in LIFO expense\npartially offset by a $13.9 million store closing and impairment charge which\ncompared to a $9.0 million store closing and impairment credit in the prior\nyear quarter.\n\n                                    -MORE -\n\n", u'\n\nRite Aid FY05 Q2 Press Release - page 2\n\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA amounted to $171.2 million or 4.2 percent of revenues. This\ncompares to $152.9 million or 3.8 percent of revenues for the like period last\nyear.\n\n"Our performance in the second quarter improved in line with our expectations,\nwith adjusted EBITDA up 12 per cent as compared to the same quarter last year,"\nsaid Mary Sammons, Rite Aid president and CEO. "We remain very focused on our\ninitiatives to further grow our business the second half of the year."\n\nIn the second quarter, the company opened one new store, relocated 2 stores,\nacquired two stores, remodeled 57 stores and closed 7 stores. Stores in\noperation at the end of the quarter totaled 3,370.\n\nRefinancing Lowers Borrowing Costs, Reduces Debt\n- ------------------------------------------------\n\nRite Aid said today that it has completed a previously announced refinancing\nthat includes a new $1.4 billion senior secured credit facility and a $400\nmillion three-year securitization facility. The new credit facility consists of\na $450 million term loan and a $950 million revolving credit facility that will\nmature in September 2009. The new accounts receivable securitization facility\nwill mature in September 2007.\n\nProceeds of the new credit and securitization facilities and approximately $330\nmillion of available cash on hand was used to repay the company\'s existing\n$1.15 billion senior secured credit facility due April 2008 and to replace the\ncompany\'s existing $700 million revolving credit facility. The new $950 million\nrevolving credit facility will be drawn down by approximately $60 million at\nclosing.\n\nThis refinancing lowers overall borrowing costs by approximately $27 million\nannually and reduces debt by $634 million to approximately $3.2 billion. The\nrefinancing will result in a pre-tax charge of approximately $16 million at\nclosing, consisting of an $11.5 million prepayment penalty and a non-cash\ncharge of $4.5 million for the write-off of deferred debt issue cost.\n\n"We continue to reduce debt and improve the financial flexibility of our\ncompany," said Sammons. "With this new refinancing, we also have more capital\navailable to invest in our business as we continue to focus on growth."\n\nCompany Confirms Guidance for Fiscal 2005\n- -----------------------------------------\n\nBased on current trends, Rite Aid confirmed its\' fiscal 2005 guidance for\nsales, net income and adjusted EBITDA.
