The full text of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.\n\n     The information contained in this Form 8-K and the exhibit attached\nhereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or\notherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed\nincorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by\nspecific reference in such a filing.\n\n     In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), the effect on diluted earnings per\nshare for fiscal 2003 of a $1.1 million after-tax loss on the redemption of\nconvertible debt was reported.  This measure is not in accordance with GAAP.\nFinancial Federal Corporation believes this amount is useful to investors in\ncomparing its performance for fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2003.  The excluded loss\nwas a result of the calling of 4.5% convertible subordinated notes for\nredemption.  The notes were called to eliminate their dilutive effect.  This\nwas a non-recurring event.\n\n\nItem 9.01   Financial Statements and Exhibits\n            ---------------------------------\n\n     (C)  Exhibits:\n\n     The following exhibit is filed herewith:\n\n        99.1     Press Release dated September 27, 2004\n\n                                    2\n', u'\n\n                              EXHIBIT INDEX\n\n\nExhibit No.   Description of Exhibit\n- -----------   --------------------------------------------------------------\n 99.1         Press Release dated September 27, 2004\n\n                                    3\n', u'\n\n                                SIGNATURE\n\n\n     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nthe Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by\nthe undersigned hereunto duly authorized.\n\n\n\n                                   FINANCIAL FEDERAL CORPORATION\n                                   -----------------------------\n                                   (Registrant)\n\n\n                                   By:  /s/ Steven F.

Net earnings for the quarter increased to $8.2\nmillion compared to $6.9 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.\nDiluted earnings per share increased to $0.48 compared to $0.38.\nDiluted earnings per share increased at a higher percentage than net\nearnings due to our repurchase of 1.5 million shares in April 2004.\nFinance receivables originated during the quarter were a record $231\nmillion.  Finance receivables outstanding increased $27 million in\nthe quarter to a record $1.46 billion at July 31, 2004.\n\nNet earnings for fiscal 2004 and 2003 were $31.2 million and $30.1\nmillion, respectively; a 4% increase.  Diluted earnings per share\nincreased 4% to $1.72 from $1.65.  Finance receivables originated\nduring the year totaled $791 million.  Net earnings in fiscal 2003\nincluded a $1.1 million non-recurring loss from the redemption of\nconvertible debt.  This loss reduced fiscal 2003 diluted earnings\nper share by $0.06 (a non-GAAP financial measure).\n\nNet charge-offs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 were $1.4\nmillion or 0.38% (annualized) of average finance receivables\ncompared to 1.11% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, a 66%\nimprovement.  Net charge-offs were 0.67% in fiscal 2004 compared to\n0.87% in fiscal 2003.  Non-performing assets were 2.2% of total\nfinance receivables at July 31, 2004, compared to 4.4% at July 31,\n2003, a 50% improvement.  Delinquent receivables (60 days or more\npast due) were 1.0% of total receivables at July 31, 2004 compared\nto 1.6% at July 31, 2003, a 35% improvement.\n\nPaul R. Sinsheimer, CEO, commented: "Fiscal 2004 ended very\npositively: our debt rating was increased, receivables outstanding\nand originations reached record levels, our earnings were higher and\nour asset quality statistics vastly improved.\n\n"On July 30, Fitch raised its rating on our debt to \'BBB+\' from\n\'BBB\'.  This is an outstanding achievement given the difficult\noperating environment of the last two years.  We view it as\nrecognition of the hard work of our dedicated team of employees and\nratification of our business model; one that rewards discipline and\nexecution.  We are hopeful that we will have higher rates of growth\nin fiscal 2005, notwithstanding continued high energy prices and the\nprospect of higher short term interest rates."\n\nSteven F. Groth, CFO, remarked:  "At year end we had $260 million of\nunused committed credit facilities and our leverage was a low 3.6x.\nThese amounts can support substantial receivables growth.  We also\nlengthened our debt maturities through the issuance of $175 million\nof 2.0% convertible debentures with a 30 year maturity and a five\nyear put.  Net earnings have increased for the fifth straight\nquarter as we continue to benefit from reductions in non-performing\nassets.  We commenced operations in 1989, went public in 1992 and\nhave been profitable every quarter since our inception."\n\nFinancial Federal Corporation specializes in financing industrial\nand commercial equipment through installment sales and leasing\nprograms for manufacturers, dealers and end users nationwide.
