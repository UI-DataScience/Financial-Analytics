The factors affecting the decrease in\nrevenue included seasonality and weakness in sales across the OEM business.\nGross margin percentage was 72% for Q3\'04, compared to 70% for Q2\'04. Net loss\nfor Q3\'04 was $2.1M or $0.08 per share compared to $732,000 net loss, or $0.03\nper share in Q2\'04.\n     In December 2003, Crossroads entered into a strategic relationship with\nNexQL Corporation, a development stage company, for the joint development of\nadvanced data management solutions. The consolidation of NexQL had a direct\nimpact on the Company\'s current net loss. Net operating expenses attributable to\nNexQL for the three and nine month periods ended July 31, 2004 were\napproximately $0.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively.\n     "Our visibility going into the third quarter indicated seasonal weakness;\nhowever, it was disappointing that actual sales were unable to meet even these\nlowered expectations," said Rob Sims, president and chief executive officer,\nCrossroads Systems. "Nevertheless, we remain confident in the long-term,\nstrategic direction of the Company and we continue to be focused on implementing\nour new product roadmap which will deliver new solutions into emerging markets."\n\n     Conference Call\n\n     Crossroads will hold a conference call (866-459-7778, international callers\ndial 678-460-1867) and simultaneous webcast (www.crossroads.com) at 3:30 P.M.\n(CDT) today.
