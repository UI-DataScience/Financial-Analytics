LOUIS, MO. - AUGUST 31, 2004 - ENGINEERED SUPPORT SYSTEMS, INC.\n(Nasdaq: EASI) reported record third quarter net income from continuing\noperations of $20.5 million, or $.73 per diluted share, for the period ended\nJuly 31, 2004, compared to $12.4 million, or $.48 per diluted share, for the\nsame period last year. Excluding an after-tax charge of $0.8 million (or\n$.03 per diluted share) related to losses realized on the sale of idled\nmanufacturing facilities, net earnings from continuing operations for the\nquarter totaled $21.3 million, or $.76 per diluted share. Net revenues for\nthe quarter advanced 43% to a record $222.0 million on the strength of\nrecent acquisitions and exceptional organic growth, according to GERALD A.\nPOTTHOFF, VICE CHAIRMAN, CEO AND PRESIDENT.\n\nThird quarter operating income from continuing operations of a record $34.7\nmillion was 66% above the $20.9 million for the same quarter in the prior\nyear. As a percentage of net revenues, operating income from continuing\noperations was 15.6% for the current quarter as compared to 13.4% for the\nthird quarter of fiscal 2003. Earnings before interest, income taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization (EBITDA) from continuing operations for the\ncurrent quarter totaled $37.5 million, or 16.9% of net revenues, compared to\n$23.2 million in the prior year.\n\nQuarterly net revenues increased primarily due to outstanding organic\nrevenue growth combined with the inclusion of the results of the Company\'s\nmost recent acquisitions -- Engineered Environments, Inc. (EEi) and Pivotal\nPower Inc. (Pivotal Power), each acquired within the past twelve months. EEi\nand Pivotal generated combined net revenues of $5.5 million during the third\nquarter of 2004. Excluding the impact of these two acquisitions, net\nrevenues increased an impressive $60.8 million, or 39%, quarter over\nquarter.\n\n\n\n                                     2\n\n\nNet income from continuing operations for the third quarter climbed 65% to a\nrecord $20.5 million (9.2% of net revenues) compared to $12.4 million (8.0%\nof net revenues) last year. The benefit of recent acquisitions as noted\nabove, combined with incremental profit contributions from existing business\nunits in each of the Company\'s business segments, led to the significant\nadvancement in reported results for the quarter.\n\nFor the first nine months of 2004, net income from continuing operations\ntotaled $54.6 million, or $1.96 per diluted share, compared to $29.3\nmillion, or $1.15 per diluted share in 2003. Net revenues for the first nine\nmonths of 2004 were $627.3 million compared to $402.4 million for the same\nperiod in the prior year, a year-over-year increase of 56%.\n\nPotthoff commented, "We just posted the most successful quarterly results in\nthe Company\'s history and are poised to finish up 2004 on a high note.\nOrganic revenue growth has been outstanding in all areas of the Company,\npartly related to business opportunities emerging from ongoing U.S. military\noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan, but, as importantly, many as a result of\nthe wide range of capabilities that we can now offer the military and\nintelligence communities. The breadth of our capabilities represents the\nbackbone of our business and will serve our customers, employees and\nshareholders well over the long haul."\n\nBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nFor the third quarter, the Support Systems segment reported net revenues of\n$134.9 million compared to $92.1 million (prior to the elimination of\ninter-segment revenues in each period) for the same period in the prior\nyear, a 46% increase. The improved results reflect the inclusion of net\nrevenues from EEi and Pivotal Power during the third quarter coupled with\noverall higher revenues at existing business units. Net organic revenue\ngrowth for the Support Systems segment during the current quarter totaled\n$37.3 million, an impressive 41%. The programs with the largest revenue\ngains during the quarter included the Manportable Surveillance and Target\nAcquisition Radar (MSTAR), which is serving a wide range of defense\napplications including base perimeter security, M1000 Heavy Equipment\nTransporters which are being refurbished after their recent battlefield\ndeployment, as well as a variety of other military support equipment.\n\nQuarterly operating income for the Support Systems segment climbed to $25.6\nmillion (19.0% of segment revenues) compared to $12.8 million last year.\nIncremental revenues and related gross profit contributions, cost savings\nrealized under the Company\'s facility rationalization initiatives and the\nabsorption of corporate overhead costs by the fast-growing Support Services\nbusiness segment led to the improved results for the Support Systems\nsegment.\n\nNet revenues of the Support Services segment climbed to $96.1 million\ncompared to $65.6 million (prior to the elimination of inter-segment\nrevenues in each period) for the third quarter of 2003, due to the emergence\nof significant internal growth opportunities in several business areas. In\nparticular, satellite telecommunications support for deployed forces\nremained robust, several security system integration projects were ongoing\nand work on vehicle uparmor kits commenced during the third quarter.\n\nQuarterly operating income for the Support Services segment rose to $9.1\nmillion (9.5% of segment revenues) compared to $8.1 million last year. As\nexpected, the segment\'s operating margin for the\n\n\n\n                                     3\n\n\ncurrent period improved significantly from that reported for the preceding\nquarter of 2004 (1.9% of segment revenues for the second quarter). This\nreflects a more favorable contract mix in the current quarter, in particular\na greater amount of production work on the Deployable Power Generation and\nDistribution System (DPDGS) program as well as the ramp up of the\nfabrication of vehicle uparmor kits. (The Support Services segment results\nfor the second quarter of 2004 also included non-cash amortization charges\ntotaling $2.2 million for customer-related intangible assets as a result of\nthe final valuation of the TAMSCO business which was completed during that\nperiod.)\n\nENTERED ORDERS AND BACKLOG\n\nThird quarter entered orders were $203 million bringing total entered orders\nfor the year to $748 million compared to $455 million at the same time last\nyear. The Company\'s trailing twelve month book-to-bill ratio currently sits\nat 1.22 to 1. Strong order flow is expected for the remainder of the year to\nachieve a 2004 entered orders target of $900 million supporting another\nrecord year in 2005. At July 31, 2004, total contract backlog, including\nunfunded options on existing contracts, was $1.3 billion. It should be noted\nthat the majority of the Company\'s multi-year services-related contracts are\nnot reflected in its reported unfunded backlog amounts.\n\nREAFFRMED 2004 FORECAST; OUTLOOK FOR 2005\n\nAs stated in its press release dated August 20, 2004, the Company continues\nto expect net revenues of approximately $840 million for 2004 generating\ndiluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.65 to $2.70 for\nthe year. This net earnings figure excludes any realized losses from the\nsale of idled facilities as noted above. It does include the after-tax\nimpact of $3.1 million of non-recurring severance and related benefit costs\nincurred and recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004. Of this amount,\napproximately $2.6 million, or $.09 per diluted share, represents a non-cash\ncharge associated with the extension of the exercise period of vested\nnon-qualified stock options. The recording of this non-cash charge is\nconsistent with the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 44, "Accounting\nfor Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation" (FIN 44), but in no\nway changes the economic substance of the Company\'s existing financial\nobligations.\n\nBased upon its initial forecasts for 2005, Engineered Support expects net\nrevenues of between $910 million and $920 million - organic growth 8% to 10%\nabove 2004 levels -- yielding diluted earnings per share from continuing\noperations of $2.95 to $3.00 - an increase of 9% to 13% compared to 2004.\nThese forecasted results exclude any financial impact related to potential\nacquisitions, several of which the Company is actively pursuing.\n\n"Clearly, 2004 has been an outstanding year of business growth for\nEngineered Support. The impact of acquisitions, accelerated contract\ndeliveries and heightened customer demand have all combined to drive our\nfinancials to record levels. Armed with our solid market positioning and\nextensive capabilities to support an evolving military force waging a Global\nWar on Terror, our Company\'s central vision statement `The Military Doesn\'t\nLeave Home Without Us\' has never rang more true. As prospects emerge for the\nprolonged involvement of U.S. and allied forces in unstable regions around\nthe globe, including the current areas of conflict, we continue to see a\nrobust market for the types of sustainment products and logistics services\nthat we offer. Along these lines, we are currently pursuing several\nsignificant, multi-year new business opportunities in a wide range of\n\n\n                                     4\n\n\napplications. We look forward to discussing many of these opportunities more\nfully during our conference call later this morning," concluded Potthoff.\n\nIn conjunction with this release, Engineered Support Systems will host a\nconference call, which will be simulcast over the Internet. Michael F.\nShanahan, Sr., Chairman, Gerald A. Potthoff, Vice Chairman, CEO and\nPresident, and Gary C. Gerhardt, Vice Chairman and CFO, will host the call,\nwhich is scheduled for today, August 31, 2004 at 11:00 a.m. EDT.
