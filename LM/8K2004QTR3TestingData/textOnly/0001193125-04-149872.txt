Conference call\ninformation is provided below. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'For the first quarter of fiscal 2005, Quantum\nreported revenues of $6.4 million and a net loss of $2.4 million or $0.08 per share. This compared to revenues of $7.9 million and a net loss of $1.8 million or $0.08 per share for the same period of fiscal 2004. The decline in revenues is\nattributable primarily to delays in shipments caused by tightened availability of high-strength carbon fiber used in the production of the Company\x92s hydrogen fuel tanks and the discovery of a potential hydrogen incompatibility issue with a\nhydrogen pressure sensor provided to Quantum by a supplier for fuel regulation systems. Acceptable resolutions for both the supply of carbon fiber and sensor material compatibility have since been developed by establishing an acceptable delivery\nschedule of carbon fiber with the Company\x92s primary supplier and securing an alternative material for the sensor. As a result, the Company believes existing and future product orders over the foreseeable future will not be affected by these\nissues. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Fuel Cell Systems revenues during the quarter were $3.2 million,\nrepresenting a 27% decrease over the prior year\x92s first quarter, which was $4.4 million; however, contract revenue for the application of fuel delivery systems for fuel cell vehicles increased by 214%, due to new and expanded programs from\nautomotive OEM customers and military branches. The Fuel Cell Systems operating segment was profitable during the quarter with $0.1 million in operating income compared to $1.3 million in operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.\nRevenues within the Alternative Fuels segment were $3.1 million during the quarter, representing an 11% decrease from $3.5 million in revenues for the same period of the previous year. The Alternative Fuels segment continued to improve its gross\nprofits and reported an operating loss of $0.7 million compared to a loss of $0.9 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2004. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, Quantum\x92s net cash used in operations was $2.6 million compared to $43,000 during the prior year first quarter. The primary\nfactor attributing to this increase related to unanticipated timing delays in the collection of customer receivables, since received by the Company that were outstanding at the end of the quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense was relatively\nflat at $1.3 million during the quarter ended July 31, 2004, compared to the prior year\x92s first quarter. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Alan P. Niedzwiecki, President and CEO, stated, \x93Although our financial performance this quarter was primarily impacted by temporary and now resolved issues with carbon fiber availability and the discovery of a\npotentially unsuitable material in a sensor, we are confident that these shortfalls will be restored during the next two fiscal quarters as we fulfill the delayed orders. These types of issues can occur in industries that are moving from one-off\nprototype programs toward more widespread commercialization with more stringent design requirements. As a Tier One OEM supplier, we have demonstrated an ability to identify solutions for such issues in an expeditious and thorough manner. ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x93Our outlook for the full fiscal year remains positive as we move forward on several\nnew and expanding programs. We are continuing to broaden our customer programs by securing new customers and additional contracts from existing customers, including commercialization programs. We plan to continue to strengthen our efforts in\ndeveloping and delivering technology solutions to this growing customer base, which we believe will strengthen our position as an industry leader, and allow us to deliver long-term value to our stockholders.\x94 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Quantum Fuel Systems Technologies Worldwide, Inc.
