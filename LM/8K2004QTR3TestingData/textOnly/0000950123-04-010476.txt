ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2004\n\nHOLD FOR CALL\n\nWALL, NEW JERSEY - SEPTEMBER 1, 2004 - Centennial Communications Corp.\n(Nasdaq:CYCL) today announced results for the quarter and fiscal year ended May\n31, 2004.\n\nConsolidated revenues for fiscal year 2004 increased 11% from the prior year to\n$828.8 million. Net loss was $22.8 million for fiscal year 2004, as compared to\na $111.6 million loss in the prior year. "Adjusted Operating Income" ("AOI") was\n$330.5 million, an 11% increase from the prior year. AOI is net income (loss)\nbefore minority interest in income of subsidiaries, income tax (expense)\nbenefit, other income (expense), loss on extinguishment of debt, interest\nexpense-net, income from equity investments, loss (gain) on disposition of\nassets, loss on impairment of assets, depreciation and amortization, and other\nnon-cash charges. Please refer to Exhibit A -- "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."\n\nDuring the fiscal fourth quarter ended May 31, 2004, the Company reported\nconsolidated revenues of $214.8 million. Net income for the fourth quarter was\n$3.2 million, a decrease of $55.3 million from the same quarter last year. The\nCompany reported AOI of $88.8 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 8%\nfrom the same quarter last year.\n\nOther significant events reported during and after fiscal 2004 include:\n\n     -  The Company launched its global system for mobile communications ("GSM")\n        network in every cell site in its Midwest cluster ahead of schedule and\n        within budget. The Company began receiving GSM roaming traffic in late\n        November and has gradually introduced GSM service features and phones in\n        all of its Midwest markets. Over 80% of the Company\'s gross subscriber\n        additions in its\n\n', u'\n\n        Midwest cluster are now subscribing to GSM services. The Company expects\n        to launch GSM service in its Southeast cluster by the end of calendar\n        year 2004.\n\n     -  The Company\'s consolidated free cash flow (AOI minus capital\n        expenditures) reached a record $198 million for fiscal 2004 up from $164\n        million in fiscal 2003, with contributions from Caribbean Wireless and\n        Caribbean Broadband now approaching that of U.S. Wireless. Caribbean\n        Wireless and Caribbean Broadband AOI for Fiscal 2004 exceeded that of\n        U.S. Wireless for the first time in the Company\'s history.\n\n     -  The Company consummated a series of refinancing transactions aggregating\n        $1.6 billion during fiscal 2004 that significantly improved the\n        Company\'s balance sheet. The new financings extended the weighted\n        average maturities of the Company\'s long-term debt and eliminated\n        approximately $600 million in scheduled amortization payments over the\n        next four years. In addition, these transactions resulted in greater\n        financial and operating flexibility through a reduced number of\n        financial covenants and simplified capital structure. The Company also\n        significantly improved the liquidity of its common stock through a 10\n        million share equity offering in November 2003.\n\n     -  In August 2004, the Company announced that it had exercised its options\n        to purchase 10 MHz of PCS spectrum from AT&T Wireless covering an\n        aggregate of approximately 4.1 million population equivalents (POPs)\n        contiguous to the Company\'s existing footprint in Michigan and Indiana.\n        The aggregate exercise price of the spectrum is $19.5 million. At the\n        same time, the Company also announced that it entered into a definitive\n        agreement to sell to Verizon Wireless for $24 million in cash the\n        Indianapolis and Lafayette, Indiana licenses that it expects to acquire\n        from AT&T Wireless. If consummated, the net result of these transactions\n        will be that the Company will obtain licenses covering approximately 2.2\n        million incremental POPS, and receive $4.5 million of cash. Both\n        transactions are subject to customary closing conditions, including\n        regulatory approvals and are expected to close before calendar year-end\n        2004.\n\n     -  In May 2004, the Company announced its intention to seek strategic\n        options for its Puerto Rico cable operations. The Company is currently\n        in advanced negotiations regarding a potential sale of the cable\n        operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will consummate\n        any transaction with respect to its cable operations.\n\n"I am delighted by the strength of our operating results for the quarter and\nfiscal year ended May 31, 2004. The results demonstrate the power of the\nCentennial brand and the positive customer experience it has come to signify.\nCentennial\'s focus on providing an outstanding customer experience is clearly\npaying dividends and bodes well for our prospects in fiscal 2005 and beyond",\nsaid Michael J. Small, Chief Executive Officer.\n\n', u"\n\nThe Company's wireless subscribers at May 31, 2004 were 1,051,200, an increase\nof 12% over fiscal 2003. In the fourth quarter, Caribbean Wireless subscribers\nincreased 21,600 as compared to the prior quarter, due to strong subscriber\ngrowth in both Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. In the fourth quarter,\nU.S. Wireless subscribers increased 2,900 from the prior quarter, aided by GSM\nand national rate plans. Postpaid churn for the quarter was 1.8% in U.S.\nWireless and 2.4% in Caribbean Wireless. During fiscal year 2004, Caribbean\nWireless subscribers increased by 97,600 as compared to 62,300 in fiscal 2003\nand in U.S. Wireless by 16,500 as compared to no subscriber growth in fiscal\n2003. Caribbean Broadband switched access lines reached 50,210 and dedicated\naccess line equivalents were 213,920 at May 31, 2004, up 24% and 18%,\nrespectively from May 31, 2003. Cable TV subscribers were 73,400 at May 31,\n2004, down 4,800 from the prior year.\n\nFor the year, total Caribbean revenues (consisting of the Caribbean Wireless and\nCaribbean Broadband segments) were $458.6 million and AOI was $181.0 million.\nAOI for the year was up 33% from the prior year. Caribbean Wireless revenues for\nthe year reached $306.2 million, an increase of 17% from the prior year.\nCaribbean Wireless AOI for the year was $121.6 million, an increase of 26% from\nthe prior year. Caribbean Broadband revenues for the year were $164.7 million\nand AOI reached $59.4 million, up 16% and 51% respectively, from the prior year.\n\nU.S. Wireless revenues were $370.2 million for the year ended May 31, 2004 and\nAOI was $149.5 million. Revenue increased 4% from the prior year due to a 13%\nincrease in service revenue, partially offset by a 30% reduction in roaming\nrevenue. Roaming revenue was $54.3 million in fiscal 2004, or 7% of consolidated\nrevenue, as compared to $77.6 million or 10% of consolidated revenues in fiscal\n2003. U.S. Wireless AOI decreased by 7% from the prior year due to the reduction\nin roaming revenue, partially offset by an increase in service revenue and\nimproved margins on retail revenue. Service revenue per subscriber increased to\n$45 from $40 in the prior year, primarily due to the introduction of national\nrate plans.\n\nConsolidated capital expenditures for the year ended May 31, 2004 were $132.9\nmillion or 16% of revenue. Net debt at May 31, 2004 was $1,655.8 million as\ncompared to $1,691.6 million at May 31, 2003.\n\nThe Company projects AOI growth for fiscal 2005 of 5-10% as compared to $330.5\nmillion in fiscal 2004. The Company projects capital expenditures of\napproximately $160 million in fiscal 2005, which includes approximately $25\nmillion associated with the build out of the Lansing and Grand Rapids, Michigan\nlicenses we expect to acquire from AT&T Wireless. A reconciliation of projected\nAOI is not included as it is not possible to project certain components of such\nreconciliation at this time.\n\nIn preparation for complying with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002 relating to internal control over financial reporting that will be\neffective for the Company for its fiscal year ending May 31, 2005, and recent\nguidance surrounding such legislation, the Company has restated its financial\nstatements as of May 31, 2003 and for the years\n\n", u'\n\nended May 31, 2003 and 2002. Such restatements primarily relate to adjustments\nthat were identified in the ordinary course of prior audits of the Company\'s\nfinancial statements, but not recorded at the time due to their immateriality.\nAll comparisons to the fiscal year ended May 31, 2003 made in this release give\neffect to this restatement. Revised financial statements for the first through\nthird quarters of fiscal 2004 are included in the attached tables. Additional\ninformation regarding the restatement is contained in the Company\'s Form 10-K\nfiled on August 31, 2004.\n\nIn addition to the financial results determined in accordance with Generally\nAccepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), this press release contains non-GAAP\nfinancial measures such as AOI and free cash flow. The non-GAAP financial\nmeasures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the\ninformation prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations from GAAP to these\nnon-GAAP financial measures are provided in Exhibit A to this press release.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nAs previously announced, the Company will host a conference call concerning the\nresults on September 1, 2004 at 8:30 a.m. (Eastern).

Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks,\nassumptions and uncertainties that could cause the Company\'s actual results to\ndiffer materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements. These\nrisks, assumptions and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our\nsubstantial debt obligations; the availability and cost of additional capital to\nfund our operations, including the need to refinance and/or amend existing\n\n', u"\n\nindebtedness; restrictive covenants and consequences of default contained in our\nfinancing arrangements, which place limitations on how we conduct business; the\ncompetitive nature of the telecommunications industry in the areas in which we\noperate, including, without limitation, the effect of existing and new\ncompetitors, including competitors that may have a lower cost basis or greater\nresources than we do, competitors that may offer less expensive products than we\ndo and competitors that may offer more technologically advanced products than we\ndo; market prices for the products and services we offer may continue to decline\nin the future; general economic, business, political and social conditions in\nthe areas in which we operate, including the less developed Caribbean region,\nincluding the effects of world events on tourism in the Caribbean; continued\noverbuilding by personal communications service providers in our U.S. wireless\nmarkets and the effects of increased competition in our markets, which may cause\na reduction in roaming revenues, increased subscriber cancellations, a continued\nreduction of prices charged and lower average revenue per subscriber;\nfluctuations in currency values; our dependence on roaming agreements for a\nmaterial portion of our U.S. wireless revenues and the continued price declines\nin roaming rates and potential reduction of roaming minutes of use; our\ndependence on roaming agreements for our ability to offer our wireless customers\nnationwide rate plans at competitive prices; our ability to attract and retain\nqualified personnel; the fact that our coverage areas are not as extensive as\nthose of other wireless operators which may limit our ability to attract and\nretain customers; the effects of consolidation in the wireless communications\nindustry; the effects of governmental regulation of the telecommunications\nindustry; the capital intensity of the telecommunications industry, including\nour plans to make significant capital expenditures during the coming years to\ncontinue to build out and upgrade our networks and the availability of\nadditional capital to fund these capital expenditures; declining rates for\ninternational long distance traffic; opportunities for growth through\nacquisitions and investments and our ability to manage this growth; changes and\ndevelopments in technology, including our ability to upgrade our networks to\nremain competitive and our ability to anticipate and react to frequent and\nsignificant technological changes; our ability to effectively manage subscriber\ncancellations, particularly in light of regulations that took effect November\n2004 requiring wireless companies to permit the phone numbers that they allocate\nto their customers to be portable when the customer switches to another carrier,\nwhich may increase customer churn and present technological difficulties; local\noperating hazards and risks in the areas in which we operate, including without\nlimitation, hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms and other natural disasters; our\nability to manage, implement and monitor billing and operational support\nsystems; potential litigation relating to using wireless telephones while\noperating an automobile and the potential reduction of wireless usage due to\nlegislation restricting usage while driving; potential litigation relating to\npossible health effects of radio frequency transmission; the relative\nilliquidity and corresponding volatility of our common stock and our ability to\nraise equity capital; the control of us retained by certain of our stockholders\nand anti-takeover provisions; and other risks referenced from time to time in\nthe Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

We previously referred to this non-GAAP financial measure in\nour filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"),\npress releases and other communications with investors as "adjusted EBITDA." The\nchange to "adjusted operating income" is a change in name only and we have not\nchanged the way we calculate current or prior results with respect to this\nfinancial measure.\n\n      We view adjusted operating income as an operating performance measure, and\nas such we believe that the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to\nit is net income or net loss. In calculating adjusted operating income, we\nexclude from net income or net loss the financial items that we believe have\nless significance to the day-to-day operation of our business. We have outlined\nbelow the type and scope of these exclusions and the limitations on the use of\nthis non-GAAP financial measure as a result of these exclusions. Adjusted\noperating income is not an alternative to net income, operating income or cash\nflows from operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with\nGAAP. Investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on\nadjusted operating income as a substitute for any GAAP financial measure. In\naddition, our calculation of adjusted operating income may or may not be\nconsistent with that of other companies. We strongly urge investors and\npotential investors in our securities to review the reconciliation of adjusted\noperating income to the comparable GAAP financial measures that are included in\nthis press release and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate\nour business.\n\n      Adjusted operating income is used by our management as a supplemental\nfinancial measure to evaluate the performance of our business that, when viewed\nwith our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, we believe provides\na more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than\nthe GAAP results alone. Management also uses this financial measure as one of\nseveral criteria to determine the achievement of performance-based cash bonuses.\nWe also regularly communicate our adjusted operating income to the public\nthrough our earnings releases because it is the financial measure commonly used\nby analysts that cover our industry and our investor base to evaluate our\nperformance. We understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on\nnon-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted operating income, to provide a\nfinancial measure by which to compare a company\'s assessment of its operating\nperformance against that of other companies in the same industry. This non-GAAP\nfinancial measure is helpful in more clearly reflecting the sales of our\nproducts and services, as well as highlighting trends in our core businesses\nthat may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial\nmeasures, because this non-GAAP financial measure eliminates from earnings\nfinancial items that have less bearing on our performance. In addition, as our\ncalculation of adjusted operating income is similar, but not identical, to\ncertain financial ratios that are used in the financial covenants of our New\nSenior Secured Credit Facility and the indentures governing our Senior\nSubordinated Notes due 2008, Senior Notes due 2013 and Senior Notes due 2014,\nand since we do not publicly disclose the calculations of these financial\nratios, adjusted operating income is the most comparable financial measure that\nis readily available to investors to evaluate our compliance with our financial\ncovenants.\n\n      The term "adjusted operating income" as used in this press release refers\nto, for any period, net income (loss) before minority interest in income of\nsubsidiaries, income tax (expense) benefit , other income (expense), loss on\nextinguishment of debt, interest expense-net, income from equity investments,\nloss (gain) on disposition of assets, loss on impairment of assets, depreciation\nand amortization, and other non-cash charges.\n\n      Set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been\nexcluded from our net income (loss) to calculate adjusted operating income and\nthe material limitations associated with using this non-GAAP financial measure\nas compared to the use of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:\n\n      -  Minority interest in income or loss of subsidiaries relates to our\n         minority investors\' proportionate share of income in our non-wholly\n         owned subsidiaries, which generated non-cash charges to our operating\n         results. Operating results attributable to these minority investors\'\n         investments do not necessarily result in any direct, immediate benefit\n         or detriment to us and, therefore, we believe it would be helpful for\n         an investor to exclude such items to better reflect our core operating\n         performance.\n\n      -  Management does not consider income tax benefit or expense when\n         considering the profitability of our core operations. Nevertheless, the\n         amount of taxes we are required to pay reduces the amount of funds\n         otherwise available for use in our business and thus may be useful for\n         an investor to consider.\n\n      -  Other income or expense relates to foreign currency translation losses\n         in our operations in the Dominican Republic because some of our revenue\n         in the Dominican Republic is collected and expenses are paid in local\n         currency, the DR peso. Although\n\n', u'\n\n         foreign currency translation gains or losses have a cash effect on our\n         results, because some of our costs incurred in the Dominican Republic\n         are paid in U.S. dollars, by excluding them we are better able to\n         evaluate the real effects of changes in our core operating performance.\n\n      -  Loss on extinguishment of debt relates to our refinancing transactions\n         in fiscal 2004. As such, we do not believe these costs are relevant to\n         an understanding of our core operating results.\n\n      -  The amount of interest expense we incur is significant and reduces the\n         amount of funds otherwise available to use in our business and,\n         therefore, is important for investors to consider. However, management\n         does not consider the amount of interest expense when evaluating our\n         core operating performance.\n\n      -  Income from equity investments relates to our proportionate share of\n         income or loss from the entities in which we hold minority interests.\n         We do not control these entities and, as such, do not believe the\n         income we receive from such entities is indicative of our core\n         operating performance.\n\n      -  The fiscal 2004 other non-cash charges relates to the write-off of a\n         promissory note received in connection with the sale of our Jamaican\n         Internet Service provider that occurred in fiscal 2003. While this\n         charge reduces cash available to us, management does not consider this\n         write-off amount when evaluating core operating performance. Further,\n         the gain on the sale of our Jamaican Internet Service provider, was\n         excluded from AOI at the time of the sale.\n\n      -  The fiscal 2003 other non-cash charges relate to disputed billings that\n         arose in prior fiscal years with the Puerto Rico Telephone Company\n         ("PRTC"). We recorded this charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2003\n         as a result of developments in these disputes at that time and the\n         protracted negotiations with the PRTC concerning the disputed billings.\n         While these charges reduced cash available to us, due to newly\n         negotiated interconnection rates with the PRTC, we believe disputed\n         charges will become less material in future periods.\n\n      -  Loss or gain on the disposition of assets may increase or decrease the\n         cash available to us and thus may be important for an investor to\n         consider. We are not in the business of acquiring or disposing of\n         assets and, therefore, the effect of the disposition of assets may not\n         be comparable from year-to-year. We believe such gains or losses\n         recorded on the disposition of an asset do not reflect the core\n         operating performance of our business\n\n      -  Loss on impairment of assets is a non-cash charge incurred as a result\n         of changes in the valuations of our assets. Although it is important to\n         recognize that some of our assets have decreased in value, we do not\n         believe it is indicative of our core operating performance.\n\n      -  Depreciation and amortization are important for investors to consider,\n         even though they are non-cash charges, because they represent generally\n         the wear and tear on our property, plant and equipment, which produce\n         our revenue. We do not believe these charges are indicative of our core\n         operating performance.\n\n      Management compensates for the above-described limitations of using a\nnon-GAAP financial measure by using this non-GAAP financial measure only to\nsupplement our GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the\nfactors and trends affecting our business.\n\n      The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted\noperating income for our consolidated results.\n', u'\n\n         RECONCILIATION OF CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME (LOSS) TO ADJUSTED OPERATING\nINCOME\n\n', u'\n', u'\n                                                   THREE MONTHS ENDED              FISCAL YEAR ENDED\n                                              MAY 31, 2004    MAY 31, 2003    MAY 31, 2004    MAY 31, 2003\n              (IN THOUSANDS)                          (UNAUDITED)                      (UNAUDITED)\n              --------------                          -----------                      -----------\n', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u'\nNET INCOME (LOSS)                             $      3,165    $     58,504    $    (22,792)   $   (111,646)\nMinority interest in income of subsidiaries            219             660             627             489\nIncome tax expense (benefit)                         5,534         (43,444)          6,452         (69,904)\nOther (income) expense                                (406)            168             (36)          1,045\nLoss on extinguishment of debt                       3,016               -          39,176               -\nInterest expense, net                               38,017          34,489         163,228         146,087\nIncome from equity investments                         (91)            (26)           (143)           (192)\n                                              ------------    ------------    ------------    ------------\nOperating income (loss)                             49,454          50,351         186,512         (34,121)\nOther non-cash charges                               1,513            (907)          1,513           4,093\nLoss (gain) on disposition of assets                 1,936             906           1,500          (1,451)\nLoss on impairment of assets                             -               -               -         189,492\nDepreciation and amortization                       35,884          32,083         140,991         139,065\n                                              ------------    ------------    ------------    ------------\nADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME                     $     88,787    $     82,433    $    330,516    $    297,078\n                                              ============    ============    ============    ============\n', u"\n\n      Our business segments were determined in accordance with GAAP. Our\nmanagement measures the operating performance of each of our business segments\nbased on adjusted operating income.

The Company has presented free cash\nflow because this financial measure, in combination with other financial\nmeasures, is an integral part of its internal reporting system. Free cash flow\nprovides an important measurement of the cash generated by our operations after\ncapital reinvestment in our business and is an indicator of our ability to\nservice our long-term debt and other corporate cash requirements. Free cash flow\nshould not be construed as an alternative to net income (loss), as determined in\naccordance with GAAP or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating\nactivities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe free cash flow is\nuseful to investors as a means to evaluate the cash-generating capabilities of\nour operations, as recurring capital expenditures are required in the\ncommunications industry to sustain our customer base and revenue growth.\nFurther, we consider trends in free cash flow when making decisions regarding\nthe allocation of financial resources.\n\n', u'\n', u'\n                                                 FISCAL YEAR ENDED\n                                            MAY 31, 2004    MAY 31, 2003\n                                            ------------    ------------\n             (IN THOUSANDS)                         (UNAUDITED)\n             --------------                         -----------\n', u' ', u' ', u'\nNet Cash Provided By Operating Activities   $    205,160    $    192,459\nCapital Expenditures                            (132,930)       (133,109)\nInterest Expense, Net                            163,228         146,087\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt                    39,176               -\nNon Cash Paid-In Kind Interest                   (13,997)        (25,892)\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)                       6,452         (69,904)\nDeferred Income Taxes                             (2,388)         79,505\nChanges in Assets and Liabilities                (68,592)        (30,315)\nOther Non-Operating (Income) Loss                    (36)          1,045\nOther non-cash charges                             1,513           4,093\n                                            ------------    ------------\nFree Cash Flow                              $    197,586    $    163,969\n                                            ============    ============\n', u'\n', u"\n\n                         CENTENNIAL COMMUNICATIONS CORP.\n                     FINANCIAL DATA AND OPERATING STATISTICS\n                                  MAY 31, 2004\n                      ($000'S, EXCEPT PER SUBSCRIBER DATA)\n\n", u'\n', u'\n                                                             THREE MONTHS ENDED                    TWELVE MONTHS ENDED\n                                                         MAY-04             MAY-03               MAY-04           MAY-03\n                                                        ----------------------------          -----------------------------\n', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u"\nU.S. WIRELESS\n\nPostpaid Wireless Subscribers                             532,500            516,600             532,500            516,600\nPrepaid Wireless Subscribers                               22,500             21,900              22,500             21,900\n                                                        ----------        ----------          ----------         ----------\nTotal Wireless Subscribers (1)                            555,000            538,500             555,000            538,500\nNet Gain (Loss) -
