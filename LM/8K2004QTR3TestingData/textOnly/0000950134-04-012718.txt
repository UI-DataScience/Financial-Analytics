The registrant's management views EBITDA as an\nimportant alternative operating performance measure because it is commonly used\nby analysts and institutional investors in analyzing the financial performance\nof companies in the broadcast and television home shopping sectors. However,\nEBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or to cash\nflows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles) and should not be construed as a measure of\nliquidity. EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly entitled\nmeasures reported by other companies.\n\n         The registrant's management uses EBITDA to evaluate operating\nperformance and as a measure of performance for incentive compensation purposes.\n\n         For the quarter ended July 31, 2004, Exhibit 99 states that the net\nloss for such quarter was $7.8 million. EBITDA for such quarter, which excludes\ndepreciation and amortization expense, interest income and income taxes, was\n$(3.2) million. The difference between these measures includes $(4.9) million of\ndepreciation and amortization expense and $.3 million of interest income. For\nthe quarter ended July 31, 2003, Exhibit 99 states that net loss for such\nquarter was $.1 million. EBITDA for such quarter, which excludes depreciation\nand amortization expense, interest income and income taxes, was $3.9 million.\nThe difference between these measures includes $(4.3) million of depreciation\nand amortization expense, $.4 million of interest income and $(.1) of income\ntaxes.\n\n         For the six months ended July 31, 2004, Exhibit 99 states that the net\nloss for such period was $15.7 million. EBITDA for such period, which excludes\ndepreciation and amortization expense, interest income and income taxes, was\n$(6.6) million. The difference between these measures includes $(9.7) million of\ndepreciation and amortization expense and $.6 million of interest income. For\nthe six months ended July 31, 2003, Exhibit 99 states that net income for such\nperiod was $.5 million.

represents net income\n       (loss) for the respective periods excluding depreciation and amortization\n       expense, interest income (expense) and income taxes. Previous to the\n       second quarter of fiscal 2004, management defined EBITDA as operating\n       income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization expense, other\n       non-operating income (expense) and income taxes. The change was made to\n       conform to the more common definition of EBITDA. Management views EBITDA\n       as an important alternative operating performance measure because it is\n       commonly used by analysts and institutional investors in analyzing the\n       financial performance of companies in the broadcast and television home\n       shopping sectors. However, EBITDA should not be construed as an\n       alternative to operating income or to cash flows from operating\n       activities (as determined in accordance with generally accepted\n       accounting principles) and should not be construed as a measure of\n       liquidity. EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly\n       entitled measures reported by other companies. Management uses EBITDA to\n       evaluate operating performance and as a measure of performance for\n       incentive compensation purposes.\n\n\n                                       8\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n-----END PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE-----\n']
