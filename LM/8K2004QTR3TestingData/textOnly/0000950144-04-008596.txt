REPORTS 67 PERCENT INCREASE IN NET INCOME\n                  FOR SECOND QUARTER; SALES INCREASE 9 PERCENT\n\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C., August 25, 2004 -- Belk, Inc. today announced operating results\nfor the second quarter and first six months ended July 31, 2004:\n\nNET INCOME\n\nNet income for the 13-week period increased $6.0 million, or 67.4 percent, over\nthe same prior-year period to $14.9 million. The increase was primarily the\nresult of improvements in sales, operating margin and expense control during the\nperiod. Net income excluding non-comparable items increased $6.6 million to\n$15.0 million. A detailed reconciliation of net income to net income excluding\nnon-comparable items is provided at the end of this release.\n\nNet income for the first six months increased $15.6 million, or 67.8 percent, to\n$38.6 million, compared to the same prior-year period. Net income excluding\nnon-comparable items increased $16.5 million to $39.0 million.\n\nSALES\n\nTotal second quarter sales increased $44.3 million, or 9.0 percent, to $536.4\nmillion from $492.1 million for the same prior-year period. The sales increase\nresulted primarily from a 4.9 percent increase in comparable store sales plus\n$21.8 million in additional sales for the period generated from new stores. Top\nperforming merchandise areas for the period included home store, accessories,\nwomen\'s sportswear and men\'s sportswear. The company also had strong sales of\nprivate label merchandise across all categories.\n\nTotal sales for the first six months ended July 31, 2004 increased $91.7\nmillion, or 9.2 percent, to $1,086.5 million, compared to the same prior-year\nperiod. The sales increase resulted primarily from a 5.3 percent increase in\ncomparable store sales and additional sales from new stores of $44.4 million for\nthe 26-week period.\n\nTHOMAS M. "TIM" BELK, JR., chairman and chief executive officer of Belk, Inc.,\nsaid, "Effective execution of spring merchandising initiatives enabled Belk to\ntake advantage of the upswing in consumer demand and realize outstanding comp\nstore sales gains and gross margin results for the period.

Founder\nWilliam Henry Belk opened the company\'s first store in Monroe, N.C., in 1888.\n\nNOTES:\n\n- -        To provide clarity in measuring Belk\'s financial performance, Belk\n         supplements the reporting of its consolidated financial information\n         under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with the non-GAAP\n         financial measure of "net income excluding non-comparable items". Belk\n         believes that "net income excluding non-comparable items" is a\n         financial measure that emphasizes the company\'s core ongoing operations\n         and enables investors to focus on period-over-period operating\n         performance. It is among the primary indicators Belk uses in planning\n         and operating the business and forecasting future periods, and Belk\n         believes this measure is an important indicator of recurring operations\n         because it excludes items that may not be indicative of or are\n         unrelated to core operating results. Belk also excludes such items in\n         connection with evaluating company performance in connection with its\n         incentive compensation plans. In addition, this measure provides a\n         better baseline for modeling future earnings expectations and makes it\n         easier to compare Belk\'s results with other companies that operate in\n         the same industry. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP\n         measure. The non-GAAP measure of "net income excluding non-comparable\n         items" should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for\n         GAAP net income.\n\n- -        Certain statements made in this news release are "forward-looking\n         statements" within the meaning of the federal securities laws.\n         Statements regarding future events and developments and the Company\'s\n         future performance, as well as our expectations, beliefs, plans,\n         estimates or projections relating to the future, are forward-looking\n         statements within the meaning of these laws.
