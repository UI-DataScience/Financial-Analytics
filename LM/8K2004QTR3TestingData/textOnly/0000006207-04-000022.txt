First  quarter  revenues  were\n$34,233,000 this year compared to $33,617,000 last year.\n\nRevenues  from the  Fulfillment  Services  business  of our Kable  News  Company\nsubsidiary were $20,469,000 in the first quarter of 2005 compared to $22,744,000\nin the first quarter of 2004, while revenues from Kable's Newsstand Distribution\nServices  business  were  $3,181,000  versus  $3,249,000 in the same period last\nyear. The decrease in Fulfillment  Services' revenues was principally the result\nof customer losses in fiscal 2004 at Kable's Colorado fulfillment business which\nhad been  identified and known prior to Kable's  acquisition of that business in\nApril 2003. The revenue decreases in both business  segments were  substantially\nmatched by cost and other expense reductions, and the pretax income contribution\nof Fulfillment  Services was $1,805,000 in this year's first quarter compared to\n$1,936,000 in the same period last year, while Newsstand Services' pretax income\ncontribution  increased  from  $338,000 in last year's first quarter to $514,000\nthis year.\n\nRevenues from land sales at the Company's AMREP Southwest  subsidiary  increased\nfrom  $6,394,000 in the first quarter of 2004 to $9,682,000 in the first quarter\nof 2005, principally as a result of the settlement of a condemnation  proceeding\ninvolving a parcel of land in Florida.  An increase in residential  lot sales in\nthe Company's  principal market of Rio Rancho, New Mexico was partly offset by a\ndecrease  in  commercial  property  sales  in that  market.  The  pretax  income\ncontribution  from land sale  operations  increased from $3,247,000 in the first\nquarter of 2004 to  $3,910,000  for the same period of 2005.  The first  quarter\ngross profit  percentage on land sales decreased from 59% in 2004 to 54% in 2005\ndue to the change in the mix of residential  versus  commercial lots sold, since\nresidential  lots  generally  have a lower gross profit  margin than  commercial\n\n", u"\n\nlots. As previously reported, revenues and related gross profits from land sales\ncan vary  significantly  from  period to  period  as a result  of many  factors,\nincluding the nature and timing of specific transactions,  so that prior results\nare not necessarily a good indication of what may occur in future periods.\n\nAMREP Corporation's Kable News Company, Inc. subsidiary distributes magazines to\nwholesalers  and  provides  subscription  fulfillment  and  related  services to\npublishers  and  others,  and its AMREP  Southwest  Inc.  subsidiary  is a major\nlandholder and leading developer of real estate in New Mexico.\n\n\n                                      *****\n\n                                AMREP Corporation\n                                and Subsidiaries\n                              Financial Highlights\n                                   (Unaudited)\n\n                                                 Three Months Ended July 31,\n                                                 ---------------------------\n\n                                                2004                    2003\n                                                ----                    ----\n\n     Revenues                              $  34,233,000           $  33,617,000\n\n     Net income                            $   4,026,000           $   3,531,000\n\n     Income per share - Basic and Diluted  $        0.61           $        0.54\n\n\n     Weighted average number of\n      common  shares outstanding               6,606,000               6,589,000\n\n\n                                     # # # #\n\n\n\n", u'\n', u'\n', u'\n-----END PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE-----\n']
