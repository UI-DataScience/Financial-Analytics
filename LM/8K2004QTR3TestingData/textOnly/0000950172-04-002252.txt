(NASDAQ: ZILG) the creator of\nthe Z80 microprocessor and a leading innovator of integrated 8 bit\nmicrocontroller solutions, today announced it is lowering its revenue outlook\nfor the third quarter of 2004. Sales for the third quarter are now expected to\nbe $23 million compared to earlier guidance of $25.5 million. Demand for the\ncompany\'s consumer products is trending below previous expectations. The lower\nsales reflects lower sell through sales in its Asian distributors and a number\nof OEM customers pushing their demand from the third to the fourth quarter. We\nbelieve the lower sales relates to excess inventory at our customers and we\nexpect it will also impact our fourth quarter and consequently we are cautious\nand projecting our fourth quarter sales to be in the $22 million to $23\nmillion range. Additionally, we expect sales for the first quarter of 2005 to\nincrease as customers increase their order rates and our new products continue\nto gain traction.\n\nTotal bookings for the third quarter are expected to be approximately $24.5\nmillion including approximately $2 million in embedded flash products. The\ncompany expects sales of its embedded flash products in the third quarter to\nbe on track with previous estimates of $1 million to $1.5 million. As\npreviously reported, during the quarter the company closed its 5 inch wafer\nmanufacturing facility in Nampa, Idaho. Third-quarter gross margin is expected\nto be approximately 46 percent as compared to previous expectations of 49 to\n49.5 percent reflecting this transition. The company expects to end the third\nquarter with cash of approximately $40 million including repayments of $2.4\nmillion in debt and after repurchasing 551,700 shares of stock for $4.3\nmillion in the quarter.\n\nAt 1:30 p.m. Pacific (4:30 p.m. Eastern) today, Monday September 27th, 2004,\nJim Thorburn, the company\'s Chief Executive Officer will conduct a conference\ncall with analysts, investors and other interested parties.
