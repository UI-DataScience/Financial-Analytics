(NASDAQNM:FCEL) (THE\nCOMPANY), a leading manufacturer of stationary fuel cell power plants for\ndistributed generation, today reported results and accomplishments for the\nquarter and nine months ended July 31, 2004.\n\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\n\nFuelCell Energy reported a net loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 of\n$18.9 million or $0.39 per basic and diluted share, compared to $15.0 million or\n$0.38 per basic and diluted share in the same period of the previous year.\nRevenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 were $8.1 million compared to $7.3\nmillion in the same period a year ago.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and investments (U.S. Treasuries) on hand as of July 31,\n2004 totaled $169.4 million. Net cash used during the quarter was $1.9 million.\nThe Company received proceeds of approximately $16.0 million in cash from the\nsale of Global Thermoelectric Inc. (Global) on May 28, 2004. Excluding the\nproceeds from the Global sale, cash used during the quarter was $17.9 million,\nwhich included $2.0 million related to the Canadian operations and $3.4 million\nof capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures were primarily for two City of Santa Barbara power purchase\nagreement power plants and one DFC300A for the Department of Defense (DoD) Fuel\nCell Test and Evaluation Center (FCTec). Depreciation and amortization expense\nfrom continuing operations for the three-month period ended July 31, 2004 was\napproximately $2.4 million.\n\nFor the nine months ended July 31, 2004, FuelCell Energy reported a total net\nloss of $65.7 million or $1.37 per basic and diluted share, including net income\nfrom discontinued operations of $0.8 million or $0.02 per basic and diluted\nshare. This compares to a net loss of $52.0 million, or $1.32 per basic and\ndiluted share, during the nine months ended July 31, 2003. Included in the 2004\ntotal net loss was a one-time charge of $12.2 million, or $0.25 per basic and\ndiluted share, related to purchased in-process research and development expense\nfrom the acquisition of Global in November 2003. Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted\nBasic and Diluted Loss Per Share were $53.5 million and $1.12 per share,\nrespectively (see reconciliation chart included in the financial tables).\n\nComponents of revenue and costs for the third quarter and year to date of fiscal\n2004 were as follows:\n\n      o     Research and development contract revenue for the third quarter of\n            fiscal 2004 was $4.4 million compared to $4.7 million in the same\n            period a year ago and $14.9 million compared to $14.3 million for\n            the nine month period ended July 31, 2003. For the third quarter and\n            year to date, the Company's revenues increased on the Product Design\n            Improvement, Vision 21 and Solid State Energy Conversion Alliance\n            (SECA) contracts with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). These\n            increases were offset by a decline in revenue related to the\n            completion of the Company's first two-megawatt DFC3000 power plant\n            under the Clean Coal contract. The cost of research and development\n            contract revenue declined by $2.2 million in the third quarter of\n            fiscal 2004 and $6.5 million for the nine month ended July 31, 2004\n            compared to similar periods in 2003 due to the mix of cost shared\n            contracts.\n", u'\n\nFuelCell Energy Reports Third Quarter 2004 Earnings\nAugust 30, 2004\nPage 2 of 8\n\n\n      o     Fuel cell product sales were $3.6 million for the third quarter of\n            fiscal 2004 compared to $2.6 million in the same period of a year\n            ago. Revenue during the quarter ended July 31, 2004 was higher than\n            the previous year primarily due to progress on power plants for\n            Marubeni and Caterpillar customers. Year to date fuel cell product\n            sales were $7.6 million for fiscal 2004 compared to $12.2 million in\n            fiscal 2003. Product sales backlog totaled $25.4 million as of July\n            31, 2004 compared with $17.1 million for the same period a year ago.\n\nAdministrative and selling expenses were $3.4 million and $10.9 million,\nrespectively, for the three months and nine months ended July 31, 2004 compared\nto $3.2 million and $9.6 million in the same periods of the prior year. This\nincrease was primarily due to Canadian operations and higher sales and marketing\ncosts over the prior year.\n\nResearch and development expenses for the three and nine months ended July 31,\n2004 were $6.7 million and $19.0 million, respectively, compared to $2.0 million\nand $6.1 million for the same periods of the prior year. Of these increases,\napproximately $1.7 million (three months ended July 31, 2004) and $6.8 million\n(nine months ended July 31, 2004) were related to solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)\nresearch and development costs in Canada. The remaining increases in the three\nand nine month periods ended July 31, 2004 were primarily related to product\ndevelopment including the Company\'s cost reduction program implemented in fiscal\n2003. These continuing efforts are expected to reduce product costs to increase\nmarket penetration.\n\nACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n"We continue to execute our strategy of establishing positions in key target\ncustomer segments that demonstrate the performance and reliability of our DFC\npower plants, while focusing on driving cost out of our products, that will lead\nto sustainable order flow," said Jerry D. Leitman, Chairman and CEO of FuelCell\nEnergy. "We believe that working with a strong global network of distribution\npartners, now expanded to include LOGANEnergy, certifying our products,\nincluding our efforts on the DFC1500 for California emissions standards and\ncooperating with the Department of Defense to develop high reliability\ngovernment and military applications furthers implementation of our strategy."\n\n      o     FuelCell Energy began operating its first one-megawatt DFC1500 power\n            plant at the King County Wastewater Treatment Facility in Washington\n            State on natural gas at full load in July 2004. It has completed\n            testing requirements for the California Air Resources Board (CARB)\n            2007 distributed generation emission standards and the Company\'s\n            certification application is currently being reviewed. In 2003,\n            FuelCell Energy\'s DFC300A power plant was certified under the CARB\n            2007 standards, which categorized it as an \'ultra-clean\' technology\n            and exempted it from air pollution control or air quality district\n            permitting requirements by CARB. In addition, this certification\n            qualified the Company\'s products for preferential rate treatment by\n            the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) including the\n            elimination of \'exit fees\' and \'standby charges\' for customer\n            electric generation, and for project funding through the California\n            Self Generation Incentive Program.\n\n      o     FuelCell Energy shipped five DFC300A power plants to four U.S.\n            customers - Sanitation Districts of L.A. County and American\n            Municipal Power-Ohio for Caterpillar customers; two units for the\n            City of Santa Barbara and one unit for the DoD FCTec. The Company\n            has generated more than 45 million kilowatt-hours of electricity at\n            35 customer installations worldwide and its current fleet produces\n            over 60 million kilowatt hours of electricity annually. The\n            operational availability continues to meet customer expectations for\n            a non-legacy product. FuelCell Energy expects to ship another four\n            to six DFC300A power plants to U.S. and Japanese customers by the\n            end of fiscal year 2004.\n', u'\n\nFuelCell Energy Reports Third Quarter 2004 Earnings\nAugust 30, 2004\nPage 3 of 8\n\n\n      o     FuelCell Energy and Roswell, Georgia-based LOGANEnergy Corp. (LOGAN)\n            entered into a Market Development Agreement to develop and sell\n            commercial fuel cell power plants, with a focus on megawatt-class\n            systems in California. FuelCell Energy will provide the DFC power\n            plants along with engineering and technical support while LOGAN will\n            contribute its expertise in planning, designing, developing and\n            implementing fuel cell projects. LOGAN currently has fuel cell\n            projects at 21 U.S. locations and one project in the United Kingdom.\n\n      o     FuelCell Energy entered into a Cooperative Research and Development\n            Agreement (CRADA) with the U. S. Army Engineer Research and\n            Development Center/Construction Engineering Research Laboratory\n            (ERDC-CERL) to provide a 250-kilowatt DFC power plant to the DoD\n            FCTec for evaluation in a combined heat and power application. This\n            distributed generation fuel cell system will supply electricity, and\n            the byproduct heat will be coupled with an absorption chiller.\n\n      o     During a "town hall" meeting today in Torrington with FuelCell\n            Energy employees, U.S. Congressman Larson announced federal funding\n            for dual-fuel carbonate fuel cell projects in the Department of\n            Defense Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2005.

Direct FuelCells operate similar to large, continuously\noperating batteries except they utilize a fuel to generate electricity, such as\nnatural gas or digester gas from wastewater treatment facilities. DFC power\nplants are hydrogen generators, and because of this are ready today and do not\nrequire the creation of a hydrogen infrastructure. This high-efficiency\ntechnology generates more electric power from less fuel and with less carbon\ndioxide emissions than traditional combustion methods. The sub-megawatt fuel\ncell power plant is a collaborative effort using Direct FuelCell(R) technology\nof FuelCell Energy and the Hot Module(R) balance of plant design of MTU CFC\nSolutions, GmbH, a subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler.\n', u"\n\nFuelCell Energy Reports Third Quarter 2004 Earnings\nAugust 30, 2004\nPage 4 of 8\n\n\nABOUT SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS\n\nIn April 2003, FuelCell Energy was selected by the U.S. Department of Energy\n(DOE) to lead a project team for its $139 million Solid State Energy Conversion\nAlliance (SECA) program.

30,\n      2004 and 2003, respectively. "Adjusted Net Loss" and "Adjusted Basic and\n      Diluted Loss Per Share" are defined as reported net loss and reported\n      basic and diluted loss per share excluding the impact of the purchased\n      in-process research and development charge taken in conjunction with the\n      acquisition of Global during the three months ended January 31, 2004.\n      These are not GAAP financial measures.\n\no     On November 3, 2003, FuelCell Energy completed the acquisition of Global\n      Thermoelectric Inc. (Global) and combined operations. The acquisition has\n      been accounted for as a purchase under accounting principles generally\n      accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and therefore FuelCell\n      Energy\'s financial data prior to the acquisition has not been restated to\n      include Global\'s financial data. Global\'s financial results have been\n      reported in FuelCell Energy\'s financial reporting beginning on November 3,\n      2003.\n\no     As required by Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 4,\n      "Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted\n      for by the Purchase Method ("FIN 4")", the portion of the purchase price\n      allocated to in-process research and development (related to Global\'s\n      research of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells) of $12.2 million was expensed in the\n      three-month period ended January 31, 2004. Purchased in-process research\n      and development is excluded from Adjusted net loss as this is a one-time\n      charge to the purchase accounting of our acquisition of Global.\n\no     The Company has used non-GAAP pro forma financial measures in analyzing\n      financial results because they provide meaningful information regarding\n      the Company\'s operational performance and facilitate management\'s internal\n      comparisons to the Company\'s historical operating results and comparisons\n      to competitors\' operating results. The Company believes that these\n      non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow for\n      greater transparency.\n\no     These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial\n      measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not\n      be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial\n      performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n-----END PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE-----\n']
