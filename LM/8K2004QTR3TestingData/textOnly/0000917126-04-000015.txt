(September 15, 2004)  -  Quality  Dining,  Inc.\n(NASDAQ/NM:QDIN) today announced total revenues of $56.9  million\nfor  the third quarter of fiscal 2004 versus $52.0 million during\nthe same period in fiscal 2003.  For the 40 weeks ended August 1,\n2004,  the  Company  reported total revenues  of  $173.2  million\nversus  $166.9  million in the comparable  period  during  fiscal\n2003.\n\nThe  Company  reported  net income of $1,236,000,  or  $0.12  per\ndiluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to a\nnet  loss  of $133,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the  same\nperiod  in  fiscal 2003.  For the first 40 weeks of fiscal  2004,\nthe  Company  reported  net income of $1,769,000,  or  $0.17  per\ndiluted  share, compared to a net loss of $233,000, or $0.02  per\ndiluted share, for the comparable period in fiscal 2003.\n\nThe  Company also reported that it has concluded that there was  an\nerror   in  the  calculation  of  the  weighted  average   shares\noutstanding in the Company\'s financial statements for the sixteen\nweeks ended February 15, 2004 included in the Company\'s Form 10-Q\nfor  the  quarterly  period  ended February  15,  2004,  and  the\nCompany\'s  financial statements for the twelve  and  twenty-eight\nweeks  ended May 9, 2004 included in the Company\'s Form 10-Q  for\nthe  quarterly  period  ended May 9,  2004.   The  error  in  the\ncalculation of weighted average shares outstanding had no  impact\non  the  Company\'s  previously  reported  financial  position  or\nresults  of  operations including net income but did  affect  the\ncalculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share  for\neach reporting period.\n\nSpecifically, the shares of the Company\'s common stock\nheld by an affiliated real estate entity should have been\nexcluded from the calculation of weighted average shares\noutstanding in the Company\'s financial statements for the sixteen\nweeks ended February 15, 2004 and the twelve and the twenty-eight\nweeks ended May 9, 2004.   The affiliated real estate entity\nleases certain Burger King restaurants to the Company and is\nowned by the Company\'s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nBeginning October 27, 2003, the Company has consolidated the\naffiliated real estate entity pursuant to the guidance in FASB\nInterpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest\nEntities", as amended (FIN 46R).  The Company appropriately\nreflected the common stock held by the affiliated real estate\nentity as treasury stock on its consolidated balance sheets at\nFebruary 15, 2004 and May 9, 2004.\n\nAccordingly,  the  Company will adjust  the  previously  reported\nweighted  average  shares outstanding and  resultant  net  income\n(loss) per share data in its financial statements for the sixteen\nweeks  ended  February 15, 2004 and the twelve  and  twenty-eight\nweeks  ended May 9, 2004, to reflect the proper weighted  average\nshares  outstanding and the proper basic and diluted  net  income\n(loss)  per  share.   This  adjustment will  have  the  following\neffect:\n\nSixteen Weeks Ended February 15, 2004\n- ---------------------------------------------------\n                                  As Restated       As Previously\n                                                       Reported\n                                 ------------      --------------\nBasic net income per share:\n      Continuing  operations        $    0.01             $  0.00\n      Discontinued operations            0.02                0.02\n                                      -------             -------\nBasic  net  income  per  share      $    0.03             $  0.02\n                                      =======             =======\nDiluted net income per share:\n     Continuing operations          $    0.01             $  0.00\n     Discontinued operations             0.02                0.02\n\n                                      -------             -------\nDiluted net income per share          $  0.03             $  0.02\n                                      =======             =======\nWeighted average shares outstanding:\nBasic                              10,163,000          11,311,000\nDiluted                            10,195,000          11,343,000\n\n\n\nTwelve Weeks Ended May 9, 2004\n- ---------------------------------------------------\n                                As Restated        As Previously\n                                                      Reported\n                                 ------------      --------------\n\n\nBasic net income (loss) per share:\n      Continuing  operations        $    0.11            $   0.10\n      Discontinued operations           (0.09)              (0.08)\n                                      -------             -------\nBasic  net income (loss) per share  $    0.02            $   0.02\n                                      =======             =======\n\nDiluted net income (loss) per share:\n    Continuing operations               $0.11            $   0.10\n    Discontinued operations             (0.09)              (0.08)\n                                      -------             -------\nDiluted net income (loss) per share $    0.02            $   0.02\n                                      =======             =======\n\nWeighted average shares outstanding:\nBasic                              10,163,000          11,311,000\nDiluted                            10,189,000          11,337,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwenty-Eight Weeks Ended May 9, 2004\n- ---------------------------------------------------\n\n                                 As Restated       As Previously\n                                                       Reported\n                                 ------------      --------------\n\n\nBasic net income (loss) per share:\n      Continuing  operations          $  0.13             $  0.11\n      Discontinued operations           (0.08)              (0.07)\n                                      -------             -------\nBasic net income (loss) per  share    $  0.05             $  0.04\n                                      =======             =======\n\nDiluted net income (loss) per share:\n     Continuing  operations           $  0.13             $  0.11\n     Discontinued operations            (0.08)              (0.07)\n                                      -------             -------\nDiluted net income (loss) per share   $  0.05             $  0.04\n                                      =======             =======\nWeighted average shares outstanding:\nBasic                              10,163,000          11,311,000\nDiluted                            10,193,000          11,341,000\n\n\nQuality  Dining  owns  the Grady\'s American Grill (R),  Papa  Vino\'s\nItalian  Kitchen(TM)  and Spageddies Italian Kitchen(TM)  concepts\nand operates  Burger  King (R)  restaurants and  Chili\'s  Grill  &\nBar (R) restaurants  as  a  franchisee.
