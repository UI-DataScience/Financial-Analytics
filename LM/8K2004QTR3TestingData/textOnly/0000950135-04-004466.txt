Operating\nincome increased to $230,000. This compares to an operating loss for last year\'s\nthird quarter of $13,716,000, which included non-cash charges for the impairment\nof goodwill and other intangible assets that totaled $13,303,000. The Company\nreported a loss of $213,000, or $0.03 per share, for this year\'s third quarter,\ncompared to a loss of $13,871,000, or $1.95 per share, for the same quarter last\nyear.\n\n     For the nine months ended July 25, 2004, revenue increased 16% to\n$40,983,000 from $35,288,000 for the same period of fiscal 2003. Operating\nincome was $337,000 for the first nine months of fiscal 2004. This compares to\nan operating loss of $14,058,000 for the same period a year ago, which included\nthe non-cash impairment charges mentioned above. The loss for this year\'s first\nnine months was $1,040,000, or $0.15 per share. This compares to a loss of\n$14,692,000, or $2.07 per share, for the first nine months of fiscal 2003.\n\n     CEO Larry Butler said, "Revenue and operating income have now increased for\nthree consecutive quarters. Also encouraging is that gross margin for this\nyear\'s third quarter improved to 13% from 10% for the same period last year. New\norders booked during the third quarter were ahead of prior year and comparable\nto second quarter bookings. We remain focused on keeping our costs under control\nand paying down our debt as rapidly as possible."\n\n     Butler noted that Alpha had an excess cash flow payment of $895,000 due to\nits lenders on September 22, 2004. As a result of the tightening of credit terms\nfrom its aluminum suppliers, Alpha does not have cash available to make such\npayment. It has requested that the lenders waive such payment. To date, the\nlenders have agreed to forebear for the balance of the calendar year from\nenforcing any rights or remedies arising from such non-payment. Consequently,\nall of the Company\'s debt has been classified as current in the fiscal 2004\nthird quarter financial statements. Butler said that the Company is in\ndiscussions with its lenders regarding a restructuring of its loan agreement,\nand expects that an amended loan agreement will be reached on a timely basis.\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\n     EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) for\nthe third quarter of fiscal 2004 was approximately $903,000. For the first nine\nmonths of fiscal 2004, EBITDA was approximately $2,443,000.\n\n     The following table reconciles GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures:\n\n\n             RECONCILIATION FROM GAAP TO NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n                                 (In Thousands)\n\n', u'\n', u'\n                                     Three Months Ended         Nine Months Ended\n                                    July 25,     July 27,      July 25,     July 27,\n                                      2004         2003         2004          2003\n                                    -------      --------      -------      --------\n', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u'\n\nNet Loss                            $  (213)     $(13,871)     $(1,040)     $(14,692)\nAdd (deduct):\n   Depreciation and amortization        673           811        2,103         2,508\n   Interest expense                     443           494        1,380         1,525\n   Credit for income taxes               --          (336)          --          (883)\n                                    -------      --------      -------      --------\nEBITDA                              $   903      $(12,902)     $ 2,443      $(11,542)\n                                    =======      ========      =======      ========\n', u'\n\n\n                                     (more)\n\n\n', u'\n\n\nALPHA TECHNOLOGIES GROUP FISCAL 2004 THIRD QUARTER REVENUE INCREASED 25%\nSeptember 13, 2004\nPage Two\n\n\n\n\n     We have included the discussion of EBITDA in this press release as a\n"non-GAAP financial measure," which is a measure of our historical performance\nthat is different from measures calculated and presented in accordance with\nGAAP.
