RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\nH. J. Heinz Company wishes to disclose its press release dated August 24, 2004\nfurnished herewith as Exhibit 99*, which presents the financial results of the\nRegistrant and its business segments and identifies certain special items that\nimpacted the financial results that management deemed to be significant. These\nspecial items include, in Fiscal Year 2004, the impact of reorganization costs\nand the gain on the sale of the company\'s bakery business in Northern Europe.\nOperating segment income excluding these special items is not a measure that is\ndefined in generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), but it is used by\nmanagement to assist in evaluating the Registrant\'s results of operations from\nperiod to period. Management believes this information also may be useful to the\nreaders of the financial statements in evaluating the Registrant\'s operating\nresults between fiscal periods and provides additional clarity in understanding\nthe trends of the business. Also disclosed on Exhibit 99* is supplemental\ninformation regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures in\nconnection with the financial results for the first quarters of Fiscal Years\n2004 and 2005.\n\n\n\n                               INDEX TO EXHIBITS\n\nExhibit Number\n(Referenced to\nItem 601 of\nRegulation S-K)                     Description of Exhibit\n- ---------------                     ----------------------\n99 (furnished but not filed)*       H.J.

Heinz Company (NYSE: HNZ) today reported net\nincome of $194.8 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, for the Fiscal 2005 first\nquarter ended July 28, 2004. This compares to $214.0 million, or $0.60 per\nshare, for the first quarter of Fiscal 2004, which included profit associated\nwith business units spun off to Del Monte Foods along with special items.\nExcluding discontinued operations and special items, Heinz\'s first quarter EPS\nin Fiscal 2005 increased 7.8% over earnings of $179.8 million, or $0.51 per\ndiluted share for the prior-year period.\n\n     Commenting on the Company\'s performance, H.J. Heinz Company Chairman,\nPresident and CEO William R. Johnson said: "Heinz is off to a strong start in\nFiscal 2005, with first quarter results consistent with our full-year outlook.\nInnovation continues to drive profitable growth in our top brands, most notably\nOre-Ida(R) frozen potatoes, which had excellent results behind the launch of our\nexciting new Extra Crispy(TM) and Easy Fries(TM) lines. This, combined with\nrestaging and repricing initiatives around the world, helped generate strong\nfirst quarter sales and volume growth against our full-year objective of net\nsales growth of 2-3%. At the same time, we continued to remove clutter and\nsqueeze out cost to improve our cash management and balance sheet performance,\nwith reduced working capital and a 12-day improvement in the Cash Conversion\nCycle. Overall, our first quarter performance is in line with our full-year\ntarget ranges of EPS of $2.32 - $2.42 and Operating Free Cash Flow of $800\nmillion - $1 billion."\n\n     Heinz\'s positive earnings performance reflected strong first quarter sales\ngrowth of 5.7% due to a combination of favorable foreign exchange rates and a\n1.9% increase in volume/mix. The volume/mix improvement was driven mainly by\nvery strong volume growth of 6.7% in the North American Consumer Products\nbusiness, primarily in frozen brands such as Ore-Ida(R) frozen potatoes.\nEurope\'s volume increased 2.1%, reflecting strong volume growth in the U.K. and\nItaly. The Company also noted robust sales growth of 7.8% for its top 15 power\nbrands. These volume increases were partially offset by a 1.0% drop in net\npricing related to the Company\'s product restage in Italy and market pressure in\nthe Netherlands and New Zealand.\n\n\n', u"\n\n                                       2\n\n     The Company's balance sheet and working capital management showed continued\nimprovement over the Fiscal 2004 first quarter. Operating Free Cash Flow (cash\nfrom operations less capital expenditures) was $148 million in the quarter, the\nCash Conversion Cycle improved 12 days, and net debt (total debt less cash and\ncash equivalents and the value of interest rate swaps) was reduced by $320\nmillion versus the prior-year period.\n\n(Comments on the first quarter that follow refer to the results from continuing\noperations, excluding special items, in Fiscal 2004. See attached tables for\nfurther details, including reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nManagement believes that the adjusted GAAP measures provide additional clarity\nin understanding the trends of the business as they provide management with a\nview of the business excluding special items.)\n\n\n     Heinz's Gross Profit Margin was 36.9% in the quarter, a decrease of 0.6\npercentage points over the year-ago period. The decrease in the Gross Profit\nMargin was due mainly to increased trade promotion spending and higher commodity\ncosts. Operating income increased 3.0%, primarily due to the favorable sales\nincrease, partially offset by the reduced Gross Profit Margin and increases in\nSG&A. The higher SG&A cost largely reflects fuel cost inflation and the switch\nfrom stock options to performance-based pay, partially offset by reduced\nconsumer marketing. Income from continuing operations grew 8.4%, mainly\nreflecting higher operating results, reduced interest expense and a lower\neffective tax rate.\n\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nNORTH AMERICAN CONSUMER PRODUCTS\n\n     Sales of the North American Consumer Products segment increased 8.4%.\nVolume increased sales 6.7%, due to significant growth in Ore-Ida(R) frozen\npotatoes behind the successful launch of the innovative Extra Crispy(TM) and\nmicrowaveable Easy Fries(TM) lines and the extension of the Smart Ones(R) Truth\nAbout Carbs(TM) line. Volume also grew in Delimex(R) and TGI Friday's(R) frozen\nsnacks and appetizers. Acquisitions increased sales 2.6%, due to the prior-year\npurchase of the Canadian operations of Unifine Richardson B.V., which\nmanufactures and sells salad dressings, sauces, and dessert toppings. The\ndivestiture of Ethnic Gourmet Foods(R) and Rosetto(R) pasta during the quarter\nreduced sales 1.1%.\n\n     Aided by the popularity of its innovative Easy Squeeze!(TM) upside-down\nbottle and expanded distribution of its One Carb ketchup, Heinz(R) Ketchup's\nU.S. market share remained strong, exceeding 60%. Heinz(R) Homestyle Gravy also\nrecorded volume and market share growth, reflecting the positive impact of the\nCompany's EDLP initiatives for these brands.\n\n     Operating income increased 3.1%, driven by the increase in volume and lower\nconsumer marketing, partially offset by higher commodity and fuel costs.\n\nHEINZ U.S. FOODSERVICE\n\n     Heinz's U.S. Foodservice business increased sales 3.8%. Acquisitions\nincreased sales 2.4% due to the prior year purchase of Truesoups LLC, a\nmanufacturer and marketer of premium frozen soups. Higher pricing drove sales up\n2.2% chiefly due to increases on Heinz(R) Ketchup\n\n", u"\n\n                                       3\n\n\nand single serve condiments, Chef Francisco(R) frozen soups, and Dianne's(R) and\nAlden Merrell(R) frozen desserts. Sales volume decreased 0.7%, primarily due to\ncustomer service issues at Portion Pac Inc. resulting from the startup of a new\nwarehouse management system that temporarily impacted shipments of some portion\ncontrol products early in the quarter.\n\n     Operating income increased 5.1%, primarily due to favorable pricing, sales\nmix and the Truesoups acquisition, partially offset by higher commodity and\ndistribution costs.\n\n\nEUROPE\n\n     Heinz Europe's sales increased 7.3%. Favorable exchange translation rates\nboosted sales by 8.4%, with volume increasing 2.1% due primarily to strong\nperformance in the U.K. and Italy. Key growth initiatives included the\nsuccessful expansion of Heinz(R) Ketchup's new Top Down(TM) bottle, the relaunch\nof the Plasmon(R) baby food line in Italy, growth in Heinz(R) ready-to-serve\nsoups, introduction of new Weight Watchers(R) frozen products and expanded\nretail distribution of frozen desserts in the U.K. Heinz(R) Ketchup hit a new\nmarket share record in the U.K. (78%), with Heinz(R) Salad Cream's share\nsurpassing 79%. Heinz(R) Ketchup's market share exceeded 31% in France and\nreached new record highs in Germany, Spain and Switzerland. Lower pricing\ndecreased sales 2.2%, primarily due to increased trade promotion spending\nrelated to the restage of the Italian infant feeding business and pricing\npressures in Northern Europe. Divestitures lowered sales by 1% as the company\ncontinued to improve the focus of its European business.\n\n     Operating income increased 5.2%, mainly due to strong sales volume and\nfavorable currency exchange translation rates. These benefits were partially\noffset by increased trade promotional spending to improve price competitiveness\nin Italy and The Netherlands together with unfavorable raw material and\nproduction costs for the European seafood business.\n\n\nASIA PACIFIC\n\n     Sales in Asia Pacific increased 1.5%. Favorable exchange translation rates\nincreased sales by 4.2%. Volumes decreased sales by 1.0% as volume increases in\nNew Zealand and Indonesia were more than offset by declines, primarily in Japan.\nLower pricing decreased sales 1.7% as Tegel(R) poultry responded to continuing\nmarket pressures in New Zealand.\n\n     Creative marketing and innovation helped drive growth in Heinz(R) soups and\nbeans in Australia, offset by declines in baby food and frozen vegetables.\nWattie's(R) in New Zealand also grew sales in soups, beans and spaghetti meals\nthrough innovative recipes and strong trade support. Operating income decreased\n5.8%, primarily due to reduced pricing in New Zealand.\n\n                                       # #\n\n\n", u'\n\n                                       4\n\n\n\nMEETING WITH SECURITIES ANALYSTS - INTERNET BROADCASTS\n\nHeinz will host a conference call with security analysts today at 8:30 a.m.\n(Eastern time).
