ANNOUNCES RECORD FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR END RESULTS\n\nMemphis, TN, August 30, 2004 - Accredo Health, Incorporated (NASDAQ: ACDO) today\nreported record results for its fourth quarter and year ended June 30, 2004. Net\nincome for the quarter increased 15% to $19.8 million, or $0.40 per diluted\nshare, compared to $17.2 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the same\nperiod in fiscal 2003. Revenues for the quarter increased 16% to $382.8 million\ncompared to $329.1 million for the same period in fiscal 2003. For the year, net\nincome was $78.3 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, compared to $29.5 million,\nor $0.61 per diluted share, in fiscal 2003. For the year, revenues increased 10%\nto $1.517 billion compared to $1.373 billion in fiscal 2003. In addition, gross\nprofit margins were 21.0% and earnings before minority interest, interest,\ntaxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) as a percentage of revenues were\n9.9% for the year ended June 30, 2004. An explanation and reconciliation of net\nincome under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to EBITDA is\ndiscussed in the question and answer section of this press release.\n\nThe financial information contained herein is unaudited. The audit will not be\ncomplete until the Company files its report on form 10-K with the SEC, which is\ndue September 13, 2004. Accordingly, the financial information included in this\npress release is subject to change pending the completion of the audit by the\nCompany\'s auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP.\n\nDavid D. Stevens, Accredo\'s chairman and chief executive officer commented, "We\nare pleased with our record results for the quarter, especially considering the\nchallenges we faced with significant reductions in reimbursement from government\npayors. We are also excited about a number of positive events, including the\ninitial transfer of patients to us from our expanded relationship with Medco\nHealth Solutions, Inc.; our announced acquisition of Hemophilia Resources of\nAmerica, Inc. (HRA); and our selection by Bertek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as one of\nthree preferred specialty providers of APOKYN(TM) for the treatment of patients\nsuffering from severe symptoms of advanced Parkinson\'s disease. During the June\nquarter, we incurred expenses preparing for the launch of APOKYN(TM), which we\nbegan shipping on August 18, 2004."\n\nMr. Stevens continued, "During the September quarter, we are investing\nsignificant resources to prepare for our October launch of the seasonal drug\nSynagis(R), MedImmune, Inc.\'s product for the treatment of RSV. We once again\nexpect to achieve revenue growth from Synagis(R) greater than the rate of growth\napplicable to the overall market for that product. As a reminder, we had\nSynagis(R) revenues of approximately $108 million in fiscal 2004 primarily in\nour December and March quarters."\n\n', u'\n\nJoel R. Kimbrough, Accredo\'s chief financial officer, added, "We are pleased\nwith the continued overall revenue growth, especially in several key product\nlines including Synagis(R), Tracleer(TM), Remodulin(R) and growth hormone.\nSynagis(R), for example, achieved 41% revenue growth from fiscal 2003 to fiscal\n2004. We are also pleased with the $37 million of revenue recorded in fiscal\n2004 from the six newest products in our portfolio. As a reminder, we began\ndistributing certain products on a consignment basis and sold our infertility\nbusiness during fiscal 2003 eliminating revenues from these products in future\nperiods. In fiscal year 2003, our revenues from these products amounted to\napproximately $65.9 million. Excluding the $65.9 million, total revenues\nincreased 16% from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004."\n\nMr. Kimbrough continued, "As a result of a variety of events occurring in the\nJune 2004 quarter, we are revising our earnings per share estimate for fiscal\n2005. We now have additional information on the impact of the recently\nimplemented reimbursement rates from MediCal and Medicare for the reimbursement\nof hemophilia factor and Medicare\'s reduction in reimbursement for our Pulmonary\nArterial Hypertension (PAH) products Flolan(R) and Remodulin(R). However, we do\nnot have the final reimbursement rates from MediCal nor Medicare\'s final\nreimbursement rates for Flolan(R) and Remodulin(R), therefore, we expect further\nclarity in the future. In addition, we have recently experienced lower\nreimbursement from some payors for IVIG. Also, Aetna has recently announced\ntheir intentions to move some of their specialty pharmacy business from us to a\njoint venture partially owned by Aetna. We also have previously announced that\nas a result of the recent amendment to our Senior Credit facility, we will be\nexpensing approximately $4.4 million of unamortized debt issuance costs\nassociated with the existing credit facility as a one-time non-cash charge in\nthe September 2004 quarter. Based upon the latest information we have and taking\nthese recent events into consideration along with the recent acquisition of HRA,\nwe are revising our fiscal 2005 earnings per share estimate. We estimate that\nfor our fiscal year ending June 30, 2005, we will achieve earnings per share of\n$1.45 to $1.53. This compares to our previously announced estimate of earnings\nper share in a range of $1.88 to $1.93. We are not changing our fiscal 2005\nestimate for revenues, which we estimate will range from $1.85 billion to $1.90\nbillion. These estimates assume no new indications for current product lines\n(including our newest product APOKYN(TM)), potential new product lines or\npossible future acquisitions and are based upon our current estimates for\nreimbursement rates."\n\nIN ADDITION TO THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS, WE ARE PROVIDING THE FOLLOWING\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS RELATED TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND OUR ON-GOING\nBUSINESS:\n\nQ1)      WHAT ARE THE COMPONENTS OF THE CHANGE IN THE COMPANY\'S FISCAL 2005 EPS\nESTIMATES FROM THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE RANGE OF $1.88 TO $1.93 TO A RANGE OF $1.45\nTO $1.53?\n\nA1)      The change in the Company\'s fiscal 2005 earnings estimates includes\nseveral different elements, each of which is discussed in greater detail in\nseparate questions and answers below.

For example, our\ncurrent assumptions do not include possible increases in reimbursement. Further,\nalthough extensive cost-cutting initiatives might allow us to meet our previous\nEPS estimates for fiscal 2005, we have determined at this time that such\nmeasures would negatively impact our long-term growth strategy.\n\nQ2)      WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED ACQUISITION OF HEMOPHILIA\nRESOURCES OF AMERICA?\n\nA2)      As previously announced, we completed the acquisition of HRA on July\n21, 2004. We immediately began working with the HRA management team to maximize\nsynergistic opportunities, and to date the merger of HRA into our subsidiary\nHemophilia Health Services has gone very well. This acquisition was immediately\naccretive to our earnings, and we estimate that HRA will add approximately $0.11\nper share in the year ending June 30, 2005.\n\nQ3)      WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE GROSS MARGINS FOR IVIG?\n\nA3)      During fiscal 2003 and the early part of fiscal 2004, our gross margins\nexpanded in the IVIG product line due to increasing product supply which reduced\nour acquisition cost. We have previously noted, however, that the specialty\npharmacy industry is highly competitive, and that we are subject to price\nfluctuations. Recently, several factors have caused our acquisition cost to\nrise. In addition, we have begun to experience reimbursement pressure due to\ncompetition arising out of the excess product supply and from product-only\nservice models being introduced by certain competitors. As a result, we expect\nthe gross margin percentage for IVIG to decline during fiscal 2005. We have\nincluded an estimate of the effect of this anticipated IVIG gross margin\ncontraction in our revised fiscal 2005 estimates (See Question 1).\n\n', u"\n\nQ4)      WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND\nMODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (MMA) ON THE REIMBURSEMENT FOR REMODULIN AND FLOLAN,\nTWO OF THE COMPANY'S TREATMENTS FOR PATIENTS WITH PULMONARY ARTERIAL\nHYPERTENSION?\n\nA4)      Remodulin(R) and Flolan(R) are covered by Medicare incident to durable\nmedical equipment (DME) reimbursement since they are administered through an\ninfusion pump and are reimbursed through one of the four Medicare DME regional\ncarriers (DMERCs). As we have previously noted, MMA changes the way the Federal\ngovernment pays for certain Part B drugs, and we expected that ultimately prices\nand margins on some drugs would be reduced. Under the MMA, Remodulin(R) and\nFlolan(R) are paid at 95% of the average wholesale price (AWP) in effect on\nOctober 1, 2003 until the DME competitive acquisition program is phased in from\n2007 to 2010. Under Medicare Part B, we receive 80% of this amount directly from\nMedicare and the remaining 20% is the patient's co-payment obligation. Each one\nof these drugs is packaged in several different vial strengths in order to be\nable to provide the most appropriate dose level for each patient. Since January\n1, 2004, the effective date of the MMA, the DMERCs have established payment\nrates for the 10mg Remodulin(R) vial size and the 0.5 mg vial size of Flolan(R)\nat rates that are below our acquisition cost of the drugs. In addition, one\nregional DMERC is currently paying all Remodulin(R) vial sizes at the same rate\nper mg as that of the 10 mg vial, thus reducing our reimbursement for all\nMedicare recipients of Remodulin(R) in that region. Since the new rates went\ninto effect, we have been appealing claims in this one region, and we were\nhopeful that the DMERC would retroactively correct this situation. We were also\nhopeful that CMS would retroactively increase the reimbursement rates for\nFlolan(R) and Remodulin(R). Recently, the Company and the manufacturer of\nRemodulin(R), United Therapeutics Corporation, separately met with CMS to\ndiscuss these issues. While CMS has not definitively responded to our request\nfor changes in the rates, we are now less optimistic that CMS will act promptly\nto change the rates or change the rates on a retroactive basis. Although a\nchange in those rates is possible and we believe that CMS has the authority to\ninitiate such a change under the guidelines set forth in the MMA, our revised\nfiscal 2005 estimates (See Question 1) assume that Remodulin(R) and Flolan(R)\nare reimbursed by Medicare at the lower rates currently being used by the DMERCs\nand do not assume any change to those rates in fiscal 2005 by CMS.\n\nQ5)      WHAT IS THE LATEST INFORMATION ON MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR BLOOD\nCLOTTING FACTOR FOR FISCAL 2005?\n\nA5)      Effective June 1, 2004, MediCal, the California state Medicaid program,\nbegan implementation of a new reimbursement methodology for hemophilia blood\nclotting factor. Under this methodology, providers will be reimbursed a rate of\nASP plus 20% for all factor products. Although we have not received the final\nASP rates from MediCal, we have recently learned from several manufacturers what\nwas submitted to MediCal for consideration as ASP rates for the manufacturers'\nproducts. If adopted by California, these rates are below our original ASP\nestimates, and therefore, would worsen the impact of the changes by MediCal on\nour hemophilia reimbursement. In addition, we understand that California is\nconsidering further reducing the final ASP rates by the inclusion of certain\nitems, such as prompt pay discounts, in establishing product reimbursement\nrates. We have included an estimate of the potential impact of these changes in\nour revised fiscal 2005 estimates (See Question 1).\n\nQ6)      WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF THE MMA ON THE REIMBURSEMENT FOR HEMOPHILIA\nCLOTTING FACTOR?\n\nA6)      Under the MMA, there are major changes in the Medicare payment rates\nfor blood clotting factor beginning in 2005. Currently, Medicare payment for\nblood clotting factor furnished by pharmacies and physician offices continues to\nbe at 95% of AWP in 2004. Under Medicare Part B, the Company receives 80% of\nthis amount directly from Medicare and the remaining 20% is the patient's\nco-payment obligation. Effective\n\n", u'\n\nJanuary 1, 2005, the Company will be paid for blood clotting factor based on the\nnew ASP methodology. We expect that the resulting payment rates will be lower\nthan the current rates for these products. Congress has directed CMS to make a\nseparate payment to the entity that provides blood clotting factor to a Medicare\nbeneficiary for items and services related to the furnishing of such products.\nThe amount of this separate payment is capped so that the total of the ASP\npayment rate and the separate payment amount cannot exceed 95% of AWP. In the\nrecently issued fee schedule proposed rule, CMS proposed a separate payment\namount of $0.05 per unit of blood clotting factor. We believe that the proposed\nseparate payment amount is inadequate for the service level requirements of the\nMedicare beneficiary with hemophilia. A 60-day comment period for this proposed\nrule commenced on its release date, and CMS has invited comments. We are in the\nprocess of preparing comments to this proposed rule. Our revised fiscal 2005\nestimates (See Question 1) assume that the separate payment of $0.05 per unit of\nblood clotting factor goes into effect, along with the ASP payment methodology,\non January 1, 2005, and CMS makes no change in its proposed rule.\n\nQ7)      WHAT IS THE EFFECT ON FISCAL 2005 OF THE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED AETNA/PHCC\nJOINT VENTURE?\n\nA7)      Revenues reimbursed or to be reimbursed by Aetna comprised\napproximately 10% of our total revenues in fiscal 2004. Our contract with Aetna\nexpires on December 31, 2004, at which time Aetna has indicated that they will\nbegin transferring certain patients and therapies to the new proposed joint\nventure. Aetna expects that the transfer of patients will be completed in the\nthird quarter of calendar 2005. Our estimate of the impact of the loss of a\nportion of the Aetna business is included in our revised fiscal 2005 estimates\n(See Question 1).\n\nQ8)      WHAT IS THE RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME UNDER GAAP TO EBITDA?\n\nA8)      When we refer to EBITDA, we mean net income before minority interest,\ninterest, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization. We have\nincluded the EBITDA information because we consider it to be a good indication\nof our ability to generate cash flow in order to liquidate our liabilities and\nreinvest in our Company. EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance\nunder GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for net income as a measure\nof performance or for cash flow as a measure of liquidity. A reconciliation of\nnet income under GAAP to EBITDA for the year ended June 30, 2004 is as follows\n(in thousands):\n\n', u'\n', u'\n                                                        2004\n                                                      --------\n      ', u' ', u'\n      Net income                                      $ 78,313\n      Minority interest in consolidated subsidiary       2,338\n      Interest expense, net                              8,125\n      Income tax expense                                49,124\n      Depreciation and amortization                     12,866\n                                                      --------\n      EBITDA                                          $150,766\n                                                      ========\n      EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues             9.9%\n                                                      ========\n', u'\n\n\n\nQ9)      WHY DID GROSS PROFIT MARGINS DECREASE TO 20.7% IN THE JUNE 2004 QUARTER\nCOMPARED TO 22.2% ACHIEVED IN THE SAME QUARTER LAST YEAR?\n\nA9)      For the June 2004 quarter, gross profit margins decreased to 20.7%\ncompared to 22.2% in the same quarter last year. The decrease in gross profit\nmargins as a percentage of revenue is primarily the result of product mix\nchanges. We derived a larger percentage of our revenues from lower margin\nproducts in the June 2004 quarter (primarily growth hormone, Avonex(R) and the\nsix new products launched in fiscal 2004) when compared to the same quarter last\nyear. In addition, we experienced a decrease in reimbursement from\n\n', u'\n\nMedicare, MediCal and other Medicaid programs in the June 2004 quarter for some\nof our products, including hemophilia clotting factor, IVIG, Flolan(R) and\nRemodulin(R).\n\nQ10)     WHY DID BAD DEBT EXPENSE DECREASE TO 1.6% OF REVENUE IN THE JUNE 2004\nQUARTER COMPARED TO 2.1% IN THE SAME QUARTER LAST YEAR?\n\nA10)     The decrease in bad debts as a percentage of revenues is primarily due\nto a decrease in the percentage of our revenues that were reimbursed by major\nmedical benefit plans versus prescription card benefits. The change in revenue\nmix discussed above directly impacts the percentage of revenue reimbursed by\nprescription card benefits versus major medical benefit plans. The majority of\nthe reimbursement provided by major medical benefit plans are subject to much\nhigher co-payment and deductible amounts versus the typical $20 to $30 co-pay\ngenerally required by prescription card benefit plans.\n\nQ11)     WHY DID CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASE FROM $71.1\nMILLION IN FISCAL 2003 TO $58.3 MILLION IN FISCAL 2004?\n\nA11)     The decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities is\nprimarily due to the increase in inventory from $90.0 million as of June 30,\n2003, to $128.3 million as of June 30, 2004. As a percentage of cost of sales,\ninventory increased from 8.3% in fiscal 2003 to 10.7% in fiscal 2004. This\nincrease is due to the growth in our business, the purchase of inventory to\nfulfill certain purchase commitments and the purchase of certain inventory at a\nlower acquisition cost. This increased level of inventory does not exceed our\ndemand, and we do not expect to have any obsolescence adjustments related to\nthis additional inventory.\n\nQ12)     WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF APOKYN(TM)?\n\nA12)     We announced on April 26, 2004, that we were selected by Bertek\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Mylan Laboratories, Inc., as\na preferred specialty pharmacy provider of APOKYN(TM) used in the acute,\nintermittent treatment of hypomobility associated with advanced Parkinson\'s\ndisease. We began the distribution of this product August 18, 2004. We have not\nincluded the addition of this product in our estimates. We will update our\nestimates when Bertek announces their expectations for this product, and we have\nmore data to estimate the impact on our results.\n\nAs previously announced, the Company\'s conference call to discuss the fourth\nquarter results is scheduled for Monday, August 30, 2004, at 9:00 a.m. CDT.
