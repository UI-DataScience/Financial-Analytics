(NYSE:BSC) today reported earnings per share (diluted) of $2.09 for the\nthird quarter ended August 31, 2004. For the quarter ended August 31, 2003,\nearnings per share (diluted) were $2.30 which included $.38 per share (diluted)\nrelated to Merchant Banking investment gains. Net income for the third quarter\nof 2004 was $283.3 million, compared with $313.4 million for the third quarter\nof 2003. Net revenues were $1.53 billion for the third quarter, up 3.3% from\n$1.49 billion for the third quarter of 2003. Annualized after-tax return on\naverage common stockholders\' equity for the current quarter was 15.9%, and for\nthe trailing 12-month period ended August 31, 2004 was 19.0%.\n\n            James E. Cayne, chairman and chief executive officer of Bear\nStearns, commented, "This quarter\'s results demonstrate the resiliency of our\nfranchise in a difficult market environment. In Fixed Income, the breadth of our\nbusiness provided us with solid results. In Institutional Equities and Global\nClearing Services, the expansion of our platform has proven its value to our\nclients as we continue to gain market share in the face of lower trading volume\nand market volatility. Our Wealth Management businesses, both Bear Stearns Asset\nManagement and Private Client Services, are making strides in pursuing their\nstrategic growth plans."\n\nDetails of the firm\'s three major business segments with comparative\ninformation follow:\n\n\n\nCAPITAL MARKETS\n\n      Net revenues for the Capital Markets segment were $1.20 billion for the\nquarter ended August 31, 2004, down 1.7% from $1.22 billion for the third\nquarter of 2003.\n\no     Institutional Equities net revenues were $239.3 million for the third\n      quarter of 2004, a 19.4% increase from $200.5 million for the comparable\n      prior year quarter. Net revenues in listed and over-the-counter securities\n      declined on lower average daily trading volume and volatility, but were\n      partially offset by market share gains. As a result of the consolidation\n      in the first quarter of 2004 of Bear Wagner Specialists, LLC, a\n      majority-owned NYSE specialist firm, revenues included in Bear Stearns\'\n      results from this subsidiary increased by approximately $30 million over\n      the comparable 2003 period.\n\no     Fixed Income net revenues were $751.8 million, up 4.4% from $720.1 million\n      reported for the quarter ended August 31, 2003. Mortgage revenues were\n      essentially unchanged from the strong level of the third quarter of 2003,\n      although the composition of net revenues changed significantly. Increases\n      in adjustable-rate mortgage, commercial mortgage and asset-backed security\n      originations largely offset declines in fixed-rate mortgage origination\n      volume. The credit business posted strong year-over-year gains led by the\n      distressed debt and leveraged finance areas.\n\no     Investment Banking net revenues were $208.9 million for the quarter ended\n      August 31, 2004, down 30.3% from $299.7 million for the quarter ended\n      August 31, 2003. Included in the third quarter of 2003 were Merchant\n      Banking revenues of $92.0 million. Excluding these 2003 gains, Investment\n      Banking revenues for the third quarter of 2004 were slightly higher than\n      the prior year quarter. Mergers and acquisitions net revenues increased\n      due to higher completed M&A volume.\n\nGLOBAL CLEARING SERVICES\n\n      Net revenues for Global Clearing Services were $214.4 million for\nthe quarter ended August 31, 2004, up 6.7% from $200.9 million for the quarter\nended August 31, 2003. Net interest revenues increased on higher customer margin\ndebt, free credit, stock borrow and customer short balances. Average customer\nmargin debt balances were $46.6 billion during the quarter ended August 31,\n2004, up from $43.3 billion in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2003. Customer\nshort balances averaged $75.6 billion for the third quarter of 2004, as compared\nwith $68.0 billion for the third quarter of 2003. Commission revenues declined,\nreflecting lower trading volumes among prime brokerage and fully disclosed\nclients.\n\n\nWEALTH MANAGEMENT\n\n      Wealth Management net revenues for the quarter ended August 31, 2004 were\n$139.8 million, an increase of 10.7% from $126.4 million for the quarter ended\nAugust 31, 2003.\n\no     Private Client Services revenues were $103.5 million in the third\n      quarter of 2004, an increase of 5.2% from $98.4 million in the prior year\n      quarter.  The increase was primarily due to an increase in customer fees\n      and net interest revenues.\n\no     Asset Management net revenues were up 30.0% to $36.3 million for the third\n      quarter of 2004, from $27.9 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting\n      significantly higher performance fees on proprietary hedge fund products.\n\no     Total assets under management stood at $28.1 billion on August 31, 2004,\n      up 9.3% from $25.7 billion on August 31, 2003.\n\nEXPENSES\n\n      Non-interest expenses increased 8.8% to $1.1 billion during the August\n2004 quarter from $1.0 billion in the August 2003 quarter. Compensation as a\npercentage of net revenues was 48.4% for the third quarter of 2004 as compared\nwith 45.9% in the quarter ended August 31, 2003. Non-compensation expenses were\n$347.8 million for the quarter ended August 31, 2004, up 8.3% from $321.1\nmillion for the comparable prior year period. The third quarter 2004 pre-tax\nprofit margin was 28.9%. The pre-tax margin for the third quarter of 2003 was\n32.5%, heavily influenced by significant gains from the Merchant Banking\ninvestment in Aeropostale.\n\n        As of August 31, 2004, total capital, including stockholders\' equity and\nlong-term borrowings, was $41.6 billion. Book value as of August 31, 2004 was\n$55.13 per share, based on 144,052,137 shares outstanding.\n\n      Founded in 1923, The Bear Stearns Companies Inc.
