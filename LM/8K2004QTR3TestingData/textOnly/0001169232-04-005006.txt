Revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 decreased\n18.1% to $1,034,650 from $1,263,987 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Net\nincome (loss) was ($160,245) for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 or\n($0.02) net loss per common share as compared to net income of $57,218 for the\nprior year quarterly period or $0.01 net income per common share. Operating\nincome (loss) was ($163,146) for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 as compared to\noperating income of $44,300 for the prior year quarter ended June 30, 2003.\nOperating loss and net loss in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004 included the\nrecognition of a loss on impairment of furniture and equipment in the amount of\n$85,721. There was no similar item in the prior year period.\n\nRevenues for the year ended June 30, 2004 declined by 7.8% to $3,759,372 from\n$4,078,119 for the year ended June 30, 2003. Net loss increased to ($722,704)\nfor fiscal year 2004 from ($479,511) for fiscal year 2003. Net loss per common\nshare was ($0.09) per share for the current year versus ($0.06) per share for\nfiscal year 2003. Further, operating loss was ($779,684) for the year ended June\n30, 2004 as compared to ($503,737) for the prior year ended June 30, 2003.\n\nRoy Israel, President & CEO of clickNsettle.com stated, "We believe our revenue\nhas been adversely affected by the consolidation and turmoil in the insurance\nindustry, which represents a major portion of our clientele. Additionally,\ninsurance companies in general and some, in particular, have changed their\nclaims-settling philosophies. Currently, we perceive that many of the larger\ninsurance companies are taking a harder line with the plaintiff bar. This\nresults in a slow down in the number of cases being submitted to our forum, a\ntrend that continues into fiscal year 2005. In a broader sense, we believe that\nlawsuits continue to be commenced and that our services should prove to be vital\nto insurers in their ability to address a growing caseload with reduced costs,\nbut the timing of such may be delayed."\n\nIn July 2004, the Board of Directors of the Company decided to explore strategic\nalternatives for the Company in an effort to protect shareholder value. During\nJuly and August 2004, the Board of Directors reviewed potential alternatives,\nincluding merger candidates, as well as the purchase or privatization of the\nexisting business. Currently, the Board is negotiating the terms of an asset\npurchase agreement with the present Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Roy\nIsrael, whereby he or companies owned by him, would assume the assets and\nliabilities of the ADR business of the Company and its\n\n', u'\n\nfuture commitments. The Company would retain a minimum of $200,000 in cash in\norder to effect a merger or a similar transaction with the intent to acquire a\ndifferent operating business, as well as to cover costs directly associated with\nthe asset purchase including, but not limited to, legal costs, accounting fees,\nthe cost of obtaining a fairness opinion and proxy solicitation.\n\nThe completion of the transaction is subject to the execution of a definitive\nasset purchase agreement, the receipt of an opinion from an unrelated third\nparty approved by the Board of Directors stating that the transaction is fair,\nfrom a financial point of view, to the unaffiliated shareholders of the Company\nand shareholder approval. There can be no assurances that the transaction will\noccur.\n\nAs a result of continued losses, the use of significant cash in operations and\nthe uncertainty as to the ability to obtain approval for the asset purchase\nagreement and to thereafter effect a merger or a similar transaction with the\nintent to acquire a different operating business, the Company\'s independent\nauditors have included a going concern paragraph in their report on the June 30,\n2004 consolidated financial statements which have been prepared assuming the\nCompany will continue as a going concern.\n\nMr. Israel further stated, "While we remain optimistic about the need for the\nCompany\'s services, we believe that the unavoidability of the escalating costs\nassociated with being a publicly traded company shortens the timeframe that the\ncompany needs in order to realize revenues from its sales and marketing\ninitiatives. Therefore, in looking at alternatives that would be in the best\ninterest of the shareholders, the Board of Directors is strongly considering a\nmerger strategy for the public vehicle."\n\nAbout clickNsettle.com\n\nHeadquartered in Great Neck, New York, clickNsettle.com, Inc. provides\ninnovative and highly effective dispute resolution services and solutions to\nentities that seek alternatives to the traditional and often time-consuming and\nexpensive legal process. clickNsettle.com, the parent company of National\nArbitration and Mediation (NAM), offers a comprehensive selection of some of the\nfinest lawyers globally, with more than 1,800 top-tier former judges and\nattorneys worldwide.
