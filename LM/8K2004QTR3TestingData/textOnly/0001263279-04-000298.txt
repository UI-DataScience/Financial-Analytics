Based on preliminary financial results,\nOdyssey expects total consolidated revenue to be approximately $ 6.2 million\nand after tax earnings to be approximately $ 2.4 million or $.06 per share for\nthe second quarter. This would result in estimated year to date total revenue\nof approximately $ 9.6 million and after tax earnings of $ 2.9 million or $.07\nper share.  Actual second quarter results will be reported in the upcoming\nForm 10-QSB, which will be filed in mid-October.\n\n"While the recent hurricanes have understandably interfered with operations on\nthe Republic project, our personnel, equipment, facilities and inventory have\nnot sustained hurricane damage", stated John Morris, Odyssey\'s co-founder and\nCEO. "Not surprisingly, weather-related issues have also affected the delivery\nand installation of new equipment required for the Sussex project.  We are now\nmaking final preparations to begin the Sussex project, including obtaining the\nBritish Government\'s final approval of our current staffing plan. "\n\nOdyssey Marine Exploration is an American Stock Exchange Company (Ticker\nsymbol: OMR) with several shipwreck projects in various stages of development\nthroughout the world, including the SS Republic and HMS Sussex projects.
