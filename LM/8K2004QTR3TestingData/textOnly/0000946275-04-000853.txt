Spurlin, Chief Financial Officer\n                                       (505) 726-6500\n\n                      GFSB BANCORP, INC. ANNOUNCES EARNINGS\n\nGallup, New Mexico - GFSB Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ SmallCap:  GUPB), parent holding\ncompany of Gallup Federal  Savings Bank,  Gallup,  New Mexico,  today  announced\nearnings  for the year ended June 30,  2004,  of  $1,350,000  ($1.14 per diluted\nshare).  Earnings for the same period a year earlier were $1,690,000  ($1.46 per\ndiluted  share).  For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004,  earnings were $198,000\n($0.17 per diluted share) compared to $473,000 ($0.41 per diluted share) for the\nfourth quarter of fiscal 2003.\n\nThe decrease in earnings for the full year is primarily the result of a $260,000\nincrease in  non-interest  expense and a $517,000  increase in the provision for\nloan  losses,  partially  offset by an  increase  in net  interest  earnings  of\n$65,000,  an  increase  in  non-interest  earnings  of  $244,000  and a $128,000\ndecrease in income tax expense.  The fourth quarter earnings decline reflected a\n$263,000  increase in the provision and $109,000 decrease in net interest income\nwhich offset a $73,000 increase in non-interest income and a $30,000 decrease in\nnon-interest expense.\n\nThe increase in  non-interest  income for the full year was  primarily  due to a\n$263,000   increase  in  service  charge  income  and  a  $44,000   increase  in\nmiscellaneous  income,  partially offset by a $62,000 decrease in net gains from\nsales of loans.  The  increase  in service  charge  income is  primarily  due to\nincreased  insufficient  funds  charges  collected on NOW and checking  accounts\nbecause of  increased  volume of  insufficient  funds  checks.  The  increase in\nmiscellaneous  income is primarily due to gains on the sale of other real estate\nowned.  The  decrease  in income tax expense is  primarily  due to a decrease in\nearnings before income taxes.  For the quarter,  non-interest  income  increased\n$73,000,  primarily  due to a $55,000  increase in service  charge  income and a\n$13,000 increase in net gains from sales of loans.\n\nThe increase in non-interest  expense was primarily  attributable to bank growth\nand an $82,000 increase in professional  fees, which is primarily due to $52,000\nin fees paid to  consultants  for  services  related to the  Company's  recently\nannounced  plans to merge with First Federal Banc of the Southwest,  Inc., and a\n$30,000 increase in legal fees, audit expense and accounting fees largely due to\nthe Company's efforts to comply with requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. For\nthe quarter,  non-interest expense decreased $30,000, primarily due to a $34,000\ndecrease in advertising  and a $5,000 decrease in occupancy  expense,  partially\noffset by a $10,000 increase in data processing.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                P.O.
