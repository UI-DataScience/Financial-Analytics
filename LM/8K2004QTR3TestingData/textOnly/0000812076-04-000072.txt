REPORTS\n                       FISCAL 2005 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS\n\nNew York, NY, September 23, 2004 - The Topps Company, Inc. (Nasdaq:  TOPP) today\nreported  financial  results for the fiscal 2005 second quarter ended August 28,\n2004.\n\nNet sales in the fiscal 2005 second quarter were $68.8 million compared to $73.3\nmillion last year.  Stronger foreign  currencies versus the prior year increased\n2005 second  quarter  sales by $1.3  million.  Income from  operations  was $4.8\nmillion  compared to $7.6 million in last year\'s second  quarter.  Net income in\nthe fiscal 2005 second  quarter was $3.7  million,  or $0.09 per diluted  share,\nversus $5.3 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, last year.\n\nFor the six months ended August 28, 2004, net sales were $156.9 million compared\nto $149.3  million in the same period  last year.  Stronger  foreign  currencies\nversus the prior year increased sales for the first six months of fiscal 2005 by\n$4.1  million.  Income from  operations  was $10.5  million  compared with $11.9\nmillion in the  prior-year  period.  Net income in the first half of fiscal 2005\nwas $7.8 million,  or $0.19 per diluted share, versus $8.8 million, or $0.21 per\ndiluted  share,  last  year.  Results  for the first six  months of fiscal  2005\ninclude a one-time charge of $1.9 million,  or  approximately  $0.05 per diluted\nshare incurred in the first quarter,  related to a previously disclosed European\nCommission fine.\n\nConfectionery net sales were $40.0 million in the fiscal 2005 second quarter,  a\n4.8%  decrease from the  prior-year  period.  The decline stems from U.S.  candy\nperformance,  as the  Company  works to address  the impact of  industry  trends\nincluding retailer consolidation, increased promotional spending including price\ndiscounting and childhood nutritional concerns.\n\nEntertainment  sales in the second quarter were $28.8 million,  representing  an\n8.0% decline from the prior year\'s quarter.  The decrease was largely a function\nof the  Company\'s  decision  not to  release  hockey  cards  due to  uncertainty\nregarding the NHL season and  difficult  comparisons  to last year\'s  basketball\nsales,  which  benefited  from a  highly  anticipated  rookie  class.  Sales  of\nnon-sports  Entertainment products were principally driven by Lord of the Rings,\nGarbage  Pail Kids,  Pokemon and  Yu-Gi-Oh.  These sales,  combined  with a full\nquarter\'s contribution from WizKids, partially offset the decline in U.S. sports\ncards.\n\nArthur  T.  Shorin,  Chairman  and CEO of  Topps,  commented,  "We are  actively\naddressing  the  challenges  we face in the  U.S.  confectionery  business.  For\nexample,  in  response  to trade  consolidation,  we are in the final  stages of\nrealigning our sales organization to focus additional  resources on accounts and\ndistribution channels that offer the greatest growth potential. As part of a new\ngo-to-market  strategy,  we are  reviewing  our  mix of  advertising  and  trade\nspending dollars and will be testing promotional pricing programs.  With respect\nto  nutritional  issues,  we have been  conducting  research  with  children and\nparents to determine  more precisely  their  concerns.  Additionally,  packaging\nchanges have  recently  been made to highlight the juice content and lack of fat\nin our products."\n\nMr.  Shorin  continued,  "On the  product  development  side,  Juicy Drop Pop, a\nrelatively new confectionery item for Topps, is demonstrating  strength in terms\nof consumer  takeaway and should  benefit from ongoing  distribution  gains.  In\naddition,  we are continuing our product  refreshment  and  enhancement  efforts\nacross all of our core brands in an effort to support their vitality."\n\n"Turning to the Entertainment segment of our business, we are working to develop\nproducts  with greater  interactivity  that  leverage our sports  expertise.  In\naddition,  we  continue  to build  upon our  successful  non-sports  franchises,\nincluding  Garbage  Pail Kids,  now in its third series in the U.S. and recently\nlaunched  in  France,  as well as Wacky  Packages  which was  reintroduced  last\nquarter and will be  supported by  advertising  in the third  quarter.  Finally,\nWizKids which outperformed our expectations for the second quarter, has recently\nintroduced  "Pirates  of the  Spanish  Main," the  world\'s  first  constructible\nstrategy  game.  Pirates is showing  good  promise  among  gaming  enthusiasts,"\nconcluded Mr. Shorin.\n\n', u'\n\n\nDuring the quarter,  the Company  paid its regular  quarterly  cash  dividend to\nshareholders of $0.04 per share.  Additionally,  the Company repurchased 206,600\nshares of stock at an average price of $9.22 per share.  At August 28, 2004, the\nCompany had $110.6 million in cash and no debt.\n\nThe Topps  Company,  Inc.  will host a webcast of its earnings  conference  call\ntoday at 10:00  a.m.,  Eastern  Time.
