We are raising our Q2\nearnings guidance to reflect significant reductions in depression spending\nresulting from the deferral of planned increases in Q2 depression spending.\x94\n\n', u'\x93Regulations, precedents and recent dialogue with FDA suggest that there are\nthree depression regulatory options available to Cyberonics to obtain FDA\napproval of its Expedited Review Treatment-Resistant Depression\nPMA-Supplement,\x94 added Robert P.

The second priority is the formal appeal\nprocesses including a Petition of Reconsideration, a Formal Evidentiary\nHearing, and a Dispute Resolution Panel.

(NASDAQ:CYBX) was founded in 1987 to design, develop and\nmarket medical devices for the long-term treatment of epilepsy and other\nchronic neurological disorders using a unique therapy, vagus nerve\nstimulation (VNS). Stimulation is delivered by the VNS TherapyTM System, an\nimplantable generator similar to a cardiac pacemaker. The VNS Therapy\nSystem delivers preprogrammed intermittent mild electrical pulses to the\nvagus nerve 24 hours a day. The Company\x92s initial market is epilepsy, which\nis characterized by recurrent seizures. Epilepsy is the second most\nprevalent neurological disorder. The Cyberonics VNS Therapy System was\napproved by the FDA on July\xa016, 1997 for use as an adjunctive therapy in\nreducing the frequency of seizures in adults and adolescents over 12\xa0years\nof age with partial onset seizures that are refractory to antiepileptic\nmedications. The VNS Therapy System is also approved for sale as a\ntreatment for epilepsy in all the member countries of the European Economic\nArea, Canada, Australia and other markets. To date, more than 29,000\nepilepsy patients in 24 countries have accumulated over 72,000 patient years\nof experience using VNS Therapy. The VNS Therapy System is approved for\nsale in the European Economic Area and in Canada as a treatment for\ndepression in patients with treatment-resistant or treatment-intolerant\nmajor depressive episodes including unipolar depression and bipolar disorder\n(manic depression). VNS Therapy is at various levels of investigational\nclinical study as a potential treatment for depression, anxiety disorders,\nAlzheimer\x92s disease, and chronic headache/migraine. The Company is\nheadquartered in Houston, Texas and has an office in Brussels, Belgium.
