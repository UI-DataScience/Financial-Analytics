Reports FY 2004 Financial Results:\nCash Flows from Operations Double Over Previous Year As Expenses Are Reduced\n\nMountlake Terrace, Washington,  September 21 /PRNewswire-First Call/ -- Cognigen\nNetworks,  Inc.  (OTC  Bulletin  Board:  CGNW-  news),  the  Seattle  area based\nInternet-enabled  marketer of communications services and certificated reseller,\ntoday announced the audited financial results for the fiscal year ended June 30,\n2004.  In its  annual  report  on Form  10-KSB  that it will  file with the SEC,\nCognigen will report annual revenue of $10,735,099,  a decrease of 1.7% compared\nto FY 2003, when the Company  realized  revenue of $10,916,272.  Cash flows from\noperations for fiscal 2004 were $227,938,  compared to $113,085 for fiscal 2003.\nThe Company  recorded a loss in income from operations of ($2,878,638) or a loss\nof approximately  $.32 per share due primarily to a one-time non-cash  write-off\nof goodwill  associated with the sale of its wholly owned  subsidiary,  Cognigen\nSwitching  Technologies,  and a  one-time  charge  of  $494,149  related  to the\ntermination  of its  InTandem  Funding  Agreement.  Complete  details  of  these\ntransactions  and full  financial  data will be able to be  obtained  from Edgar\nOnline and other similar sources in the Form 10-KSB report.\n\nCognigen\'s  president  and CEO,  Thomas S. Smith,  commented,  "Fiscal Year 2004\nbrought  significant  changes in the Company\'s  corporate  structure.  First, we\nconcluded  the  sale  of  Cognigen  Switching  Technologies  as  part  of a cost\ncontainment  strategy  that is  producing  savings of  approximately  $25,000 to\n$30,000 per month while  maintaining the delivery of services at presale levels.\nSecond,  we concluded the funding  agreement  with InTandem that resulted in our\nacquisition of that company while containing our future funding obligations.  As\na further  reflection of Cognigen\'s  program to transition from vendor agency to\nreseller status,  telecommunication revenue increased $1,647,948 or 41% over the\nprevious fiscal year while marketing commissions revenue decreased by $1,837,829\nor 27% less than in FY 2003..  While the overall  lack of revenue  growth is not\nacceptable,  it does reflect general  conditions  within our sector of marketing\ntelecommunication  services.  To  counteract  this trend,  Cognigen has moved to\nexpand its proprietary  customer base.  Success in this endeavor can be measured\nby the 136% increase in the number of proprietary  customers  Cognigen gained in\nfiscal year 2004.  The number of proprietary  customers grew from  approximately\n11,000 in FY 2003 to 26,000 as of June 30, 2004."\n\nMr. Smith, concluded,  "Cognigen\'s selling,  general and administrative expenses\nfor FY 2004  decreased by $124,094  compared to FY 2003, a 3%  reduction."  This\ntrend  is  expected  to  continue  with  the  cost  and  expense  reductions  of\napproximately  $20,000 per month over and above the $25,000 to $30,000 per month\ncreated by the sale of Cognigen Switching Technologies."\n\n', u'About Cognigen', u'\n\nCognigen  Networks,  Inc. based in Seattle,  Washington,  offers a wide range of\ntelecommunication  services  and related  technology  products via its Web site,\n', u'http://www.cognigen.com', u".
