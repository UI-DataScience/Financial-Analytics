(August 26, 2004) - Fred\'s Inc. (NASDAQ/NM:  FRED) today reported\nfinancial  results for the second fiscal quarter and six-month period ended July\n31, 2004.\n\n     Net income for the second quarter of 2004 totaled $3.1 million or $0.08 per\ndiluted share versus $4.4 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the year-earlier\nperiod.  For the first half of 2004,  net income was $10.5  million or $0.27 per\ndiluted share compared with $12.2 million or $0.31 per diluted share in the same\nperiod last year.\n\n     Retail sales by Company stores for the second quarter of 2004 increased 13%\nand total sales for the quarter also rose 13% to $340.9  million  versus  $302.3\nmillion in the same  period  last  year.  On a  comparable  store  basis,  sales\nincreased  4.2% for the  quarter.  For the first half of 2004,  retail  sales by\nCompany  stores  increased 12% and total sales for the period rose 11% to $682.3\nmillion  compared with $613.0  million in the  year-earlier  period.  Comparable\nstore sales for the first six months of 2004 increased 3.2% over the same period\nlast year.\n\n     Commenting on the results, Michael J. Hayes, Chief Executive Officer, said,\n"We were  optimistic  about the good start to the quarter we had in May, only to\nbe  disappointed  in the  results  for  June and  July - with  apparel  and home\nfurnishings being the two key sales areas hit the hardest.  The impact of softer\nsales,  a shift in our sales mix, and  increased  markdowns,  combined  with the\nrun-up in transportation expenses due to higher diesel fuel costs, trimmed three\ncents from planned  earnings per share - as discussed in our July sales release.\nThe  unanticipated  factor was a sharp  increase in our quarterly LIFO inflation\nindex, which resulted in an additional one-cent reduction in earnings per share.\n\n     "As we head into the  third  and  fourth  quarters,  we do so with  guarded\noptimism,"  Hayes  added.  "We are seeing  some  strength  in the soft lines and\ndomestics,  but  continue  to  experience  negative  comparable  sales  in  home\nfurnishings.  Also,  markdowns will probably remain over plan for the balance of\nthe year as we continue  to bring  inventory  back in line and as our  customers\nremain   focused  on  promotional   opportunities.   We  believe  the  continued\nimprovement in inventory and store fundamentals will pay off for us as consumers\nbecome more confident in their spending with the approach of the holiday season.\nAlso, our store expansion program remains on track to add 85 to 90 new stores to\nour chain in 2004,  with 46 of those  already  opened in the first  half of this\nyear"\n\n\n                                     -MORE-\n', u"\n\nFRED Reports Second Quarter Results\nPage 2\nAugust 26, 2004\n\n\n     Fred's gross profit for the second quarter was $94.0 million  compared with\n$84.9 million in the prior-year period,  representing an increase of 11% for the\nperiod.  Gross margin for the quarter was 27.6% versus 28.1% last year, with the\ndecline  reflecting a change in product mix toward basic products,  markdowns on\npromotional  products,  the impact of  reinstating  double  coupon on Saturdays,\npharmacy LIFO inflation  index  increase,  and increased  freight  costs.  Gross\nprofit for the first six months of 2004  increased  10% to $190.8  million  from\n$172.9 million in the first half of 2003. Gross margin for the 2004 year-to-date\nperiod was 28.0% versus 28.2% in the same period last year.\n\n     Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2004\nincreased to 26.1% of sales versus 25.9% of sales in the year-earlier period. On\na  year-to-date  basis in 2004,  selling,  general and  administrative  expenses\nincreased  to 25.6% of sales  compared  with 25.2% of sales in the first half of\n2003. The increase in the expenses for the quarter and  year-to-date  period was\nattributable to higher store expenses  relative to sales,  insurance  costs, and\nutilities and fuel related increases.\n\n     Operating  income  for the  second  quarter  of 2004  declined  26% to $5.0\nmillion from $6.7 million in the year-earlier period.
