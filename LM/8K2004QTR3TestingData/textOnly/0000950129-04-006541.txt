Unit holders of record on September 7,\n2004 will receive a distribution of $731,391 or approximately $0.038512 per Unit\npayable on September 15, 2004.\n\nThe distribution includes no proceeds from the Jay Field property due to excess\nproduction costs. Excess production costs to be recouped from future proceeds at\nthe Jay Field property total $679,940.\n\nThe Working Interest Owner, under the terms of the Trust Conveyance, is\npermitted to escrow funds up to 125% of the estimated future costs such as\ndismantlement costs and capital expenditures for the properties in which the\nTrust has an interest (Special Cost Escrow). According to the most recent\nreserve report, estimated dismantlement costs are $13.3 million for Jay Field\nproperty, $1.9 million for South Pass 89 property and $2.3 million for Offshore\nLouisiana property. The Working Interest Owner has informed the Trustee that it\nhas elected not to escrow any additional funds at this time. However, the\nWorking Interest Owner intends to continue to monitor each of the properties in\nwhich the Trust has an interest for possible changes in relevant factors, which\nmay warrant a need for additional escrow. To date, the amounts escrowed for\nfuture dismantlement costs total approximately $4.5 million for Jay Field\nproperty, $2.6 million for South Pass 89 property and $3 million for the\nOffshore Louisiana property. The amounts escrowed on the South Pass 89 and\nOffshore Louisiana properties exceed 125% of the estimated future dismantlement\ncosts by approximately $225,000 and $125,000 respectively. The Trust Conveyance\npermits, but does not require, the Working Interest Owner to release the excess\nescrowed funds, and the Working Interest Owner has informed the Trustee that it\ndoes not intend to release any portion of the escrowed funds at this time.\n\nGross Proceeds prior to deductions for Production Costs for the month of June\n2004 by property is as follows: $1,683,399 for Jay Field property, $81,193 for\nSouth Pass 89 property, and $866,456 for Offshore Louisiana property.\n\nProduction Costs for the month of June 2004 by property is as follows:\n$2,363,339 for Jay Field property and $137,158 for Offshore Louisiana property.\nSouth Pass 89 property had a negative net operating expense of $35,901, which\nwas a result of third party credits totaling $74,021. Actual production costs\nattributable to the South Pass property for the month of May 2004 were $38,120.\n\n', u"\n\nThere was no deduction made for the Special Cost Escrow in June 2004. Fee Lands\nRoyalties for the month of June 2004 totaled $52,446. Trust related expenses for\nthe month of June 2004 totaled $35,970.\n\nThe Gross Proceeds, Production Costs and Special Cost Escrow numbers stated\nabove relate to each property as a whole. The Trust's interest in these\nproperties is 50% for Jay Field, 50% for South Pass 89 and 90% for Offshore\nLouisiana.\n\nThe extent of future distributions from the properties in which the Trust has an\ninterest will continue to be dependent on normal factors associated with oil and\ngas operations such as oil and gas production levels, prices and associated\ncost, timing and extent of capital expenditures. In addition, the amount of\nfuture distributions will depend on the amounts escrowed by the Working Interest\nOwner as described above.\n\nThe Trust income distribution announcement for the month of October will be made\non or about September 24, 2004.\n\n\n\nCONTACT:  LL&E ROYALTY TRUST\n          JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, AS TRUSTEE\n          MIKE ULRICH\n          (800) 852-1422\n          WWW.BUSINESSWIRE.COM/CNN/LRT.HTM\n\n\n", u'\n', u'\n', u'\n-----END PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE-----\n']
