MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS.\n\n         The Company will report a charge against earnings of approximately\n$850,000 (pretax) in the quarter ended August 31, 2004 resulting from the\ninsolvency and liquidation of a Kansas irrigation equipment dealer in which the\nCompany held a minority interest.\n\n         On August 31, 2004, the Company concluded that it will incur bad debt\nexpense of approximately $600,000 (pretax) on trade receivables due to it from\nthe dealership. This impairment represents the amount of trade receivables in\nexcess of bad debt reserves previously established by the Company. On August 30,\n2004, assets of the dealership were sold at auction and the proceeds were\napplied in part to the Company\'s trade receivables and, in part, to the\ndealership\'s obligations under bank loans. Results of the auction were available\non August 31, 2004, at which time the Company determined the magnitude of the\nimpairment charge on its trade receivables. The impairment charge on trade\nreceivables will not result in future cash expenditures by the Company\n\n         In addition to the impairment of these trade receivables, the Company\nexpects to make cash payments of approximately $250,000 (pretax) on its\nguarantee of certain bank loans relating to the dealership.\n\n         The Company did not recognize an impairment charge on its minority\ninterest in the dealership since it had previously eliminated its investment in\nthe dealership to reflect the Company\'s allocable share of losses incurred by\nthe dealership.\n\nITEM 9.01.

UPDATES OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2004\n\n         CHARGE RELATED TO DEALER WILL IMPACT EPS BY APPROXIMATELY $0.05\n  FOURTH-QUARTER REVENUES REMAIN STRONG; FULL-YEAR REVENUES EXCEED EXPECTATIONS\n\nOMAHA, NEB., SEPTEMBER 7, 2004--LINDSAY MANUFACTURING CO. (NYSE: LNN), a leading\nmanufacturer of center pivot, lateral move, and hose reel irrigation systems,\ntoday updated its outlook for its fiscal year ending August 31, 2004.\n\nThe company announced today that, due to the insolvency and liquidation of a\nKansas dealership in which Lindsay held a minority interest, it will take a\ncharge during the quarter ending August 31, 2004, of approximately $0.05 per\nshare. The majority of this charge represents a bad debt expense relating to a\nLindsay trade receivable from this dealership. The remaining portion of the\ncharge represents Lindsay's expected obligation on its limited guarantee of bank\nloans related to the dealership. Lindsay's equity investment in the dealership\nhad previously been eliminated due to its allocation of losses from the\ndealership.\n\nPrior to this charge, Lindsay's management had anticipated that full-year fiscal\n2004 earnings per share would be slightly above $0.90 per share. The company\nalso noted that revenues through the fourth quarter remained strong and Lindsay\nexceeded its goal of 14 to 16 percent organic revenue growth for fiscal 2004.\n\nLindsay anticipates releasing its fiscal 2004 fourth-quarter and full-year\nearnings during the second full week of October.\n\nABOUT THE COMPANY\nLindsay manufactures and markets Zimmatic, Greenfield, and Perrot center pivot,\nlateral move and hose reel irrigation systems and GrowSmart controls, all of\nwhich are used by farmers to increase or stabilize crop production while\nconserving water, energy, and labor. The company also produces large diameter\nsteel tubing and provides outsourced manufacturing and production services for\nother companies. At May 31, 2004, Lindsay had approximately 11.8 million shares\noutstanding, which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol\nLNN.\n\n", u'\n\nCONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and\nuncertainties and which reflect management\'s current beliefs and estimates of\nfuture economic circumstances, industry conditions, Company performance and\nfinancial results.
