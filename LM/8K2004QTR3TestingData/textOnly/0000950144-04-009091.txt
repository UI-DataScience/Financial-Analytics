(NYSE: ODP) today\nannounced that it expects earnings per share for the third quarter to fall\nbelow current First Call\xae consensus estimates. The Company expects to report\nthird quarter EPS of $0.26 to $0.28.\n\n\n', u'The Company does not expect to recover this shortfall during the fourth\nquarter, and sees additional risks primarily because of a lowered sales outlook\nfor the balance of the year across all business segments. Continued softness\nin European contract sales, lower than expected sales growth in North American\nBusiness Services Group (BSG) contract and commercial sales, and weaker than expected North American\nRetail comps have contributed to the reduced revenue outlook. As a result,\nOffice Depot now expects full year EPS to be in the range of $1.08 to $1.14.\nThe Company expects its cash position at year-end to be between $1.1\xa0billion\nand $1.2\xa0billion.\n\n\n', u'Bruce Nelson, Office Depot\x92s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented,\n\x93Although we have not completed the third quarter, a number of factors indicate\nthat we will not meet consensus expectations for the current quarter or the\nyear. Revenues in the quarter have not met our expectations across all three\nof our business units. In addition, we have sustained unexpected costs and\nlost sales from the impact of three major storms and the contingency planning\nfor a fourth storm, Hurricane Ivan. A significant portion of the Company\x92s\nNorth American revenue base comes from the areas impacted by the recent storms,\nand our global headquarters in Delray Beach, Florida, was closed for four\nbusiness days.\x94\n\n\n', u'European sales, in local currencies, which are typically softer in August on a\nseasonal basis, were notably below expectations this year in the catalog operations, and in the Guilbert contract business. September sales,\nwhile improving somewhat, have not yet returned to anticipated levels. The\nCompany\x92s Guilbert business, acquired last year, has not yet generated the\nrevenue lift expected at the time of the acquisition and continues to show\nnegative year-over-year sales results.\n\n\n', u'In the North American BSG contract sales are trending at\nlevels similar to those recorded in the first half of the year, although the\nCompany had expected some acceleration. Office Depot\ncatalog sales are encouraging and 4Sure.com sales remain strong; however,\nViking catalog sales continue to track below forecasted levels.\n\n\n\n', u'\xa0\n', u'\n', u' PAGEBREAK ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'In North American Retail,\nBack-to-School sales have been tracking well below\nexpectations, consistent with other retailers who have also reported a\nchallenging BTS season. Retail comp sales are now expected to be flat to\nslightly positive for the third quarter, and to regain some positive movement\nin the fourth quarter. The Company still anticipates that Q4 will be the\nstrongest retail comp growth quarter this year, but will fall short of earlier\nhigh single digit growth projections.\n\n\n', u'Nelson added, \x93Office Depot continues to expect traction from a variety of\ngrowth and profit initiatives, including: Rebuilding the Guilbert sales force\nfollowing departures in the year since the acquisition of that business;\nfocusing on adding sales resources and reduction of costs in our North American\nBSG; and continuing the roll-out of the new M2 retail store model in North\nAmerica.\x94\n\n\n', u'Nelson continued, \x93Distribution system costs continue to improve, without\ncompromising service levels. Additionally, the Company is addressing overall\noperating costs on a comprehensive basis, and expects to be in a position to\nannounce a number of significant cost saving, productivity and efficiency\ninitiatives later this year.\x94\n\n\n', u'As mentioned previously, a portion of the anticipated earnings shortfall for\nthe quarter and the year is attributable to the active tropical storm season in\nthe Company\x92s home state of Florida and elsewhere in the southeastern United\nStates. The Company currently estimates the impact on earnings from lost\nsales, as well as direct and indirect storm-related costs, to be a negative\n$0.01 to $0.02 per share. Most facilities, other than those in the path of\nHurricane Ivan, are currently operating at basically normal levels. All\ncorporate information systems and data assets remain intact.\n\n\n', u'Office Depot expects to release third quarter financial results on October\xa020,\n2004 and to further update its views on the balance of 2004 at that time.\n\n\n\n', u'About Office Depot', u'\n', u'With annual sales of more than $12\xa0billion, no one sells more office supplies\nto more customers in more countries than Office Depot. Founded in 1986 and\nheadquartered in Delray Beach, Fla., the company conducts business in 23\ncountries and employs nearly 50,000 people worldwide.\n\n\n', u'Office Depot is a leader in every distribution channel \x96 from retail stores and\ncontract delivery to catalogs and e-commerce.
