In particular, the\nDepartment\'s action in seeking rehabilitation will adversely affect the\nCompany\'s ability to manage its runoff and to restructure its operations or sell\nits assets and to continue as a going concern. These and other uncertainties and\nother factors are detailed from time to time in the Company\'s filings with the\nappropriate securities commissions, and include, without limitation, the Company\nhaving sufficient liquidity and working capital, the performance\n\n', u'\n\nof the Company\'s investment portfolio, the Company\'s ability to manage claims,\nmaintaining existing reinsurance agreements at reasonable terms, the Company\'s\nability to diversify its product lines, the continued adequacy of the Company\'s\nloss and loss adjustment expense reserves, the Company\'s avoidance of any\nmaterial loss on collection of reinsurance recoverables, adverse actions of\napplicable regulatory agencies, general economic conditions, including changing\ninterest rates, rates of inflation and the performance of the financial markets,\nadverse judicial decisions and rulings, changes in domestic and foreign laws,\nregulations and taxes, effects of acquisitions and divestitures and various\nother factors. The words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "project" and\nsimilar expressions identify forward-looking statements. The Company\'s\nexpectations regarding future earnings, growth initiatives, underwriting, cost\ncontrols, adequacy of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, and enhancing\nshareholder value depend on a variety of factors, including economic,\ncompetitive and market conditions which may be beyond the Company\'s control and\nare thus difficult or impossible to predict. In light of the significant\nuncertainties inherent in the forward-looking information herein, the inclusion\nof such information should not be regarded as representation by the Company or\nany other person that the Company\'s objectives or plans will be realized.\nReaders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking\nstatements, which speak only as of their dates.
