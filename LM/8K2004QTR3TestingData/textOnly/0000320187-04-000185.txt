(NYSE:NKE) today\nreported revenues and earnings for the Company\'s first quarter ended\nAugust 31, 2004.  First quarter revenues increased 18 percent to $3.6\nbillion, versus $3.0 billion for the same period last year. First quarter\nnet income totaled $326.8 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, compared\nto $261.2 million, or $0.98 per diluted share in the prior year.\n\n"We\'re off to a great start," said Philip H. Knight, Chairman and CEO.\n"Our first quarter revenues reached record levels driven by strong\nresults around the world and across all our brands.  These results\nreflect both the strength of our brands and our ability to execute across\nour portfolio of businesses."*\n\nKnight added, "Nike\'s consistent performance has been the result of the\nquality of our management team and our commitment to delivering value to\nshareholders over the long-term."*\n\nFutures Orders\n\nThe Company reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and\napparel, scheduled for delivery from September 2004 through January 2005,\ntotaling $4.3 billion, 9.9 percent higher than such orders reported for\nthe same period last year.

In Europe, three points of the increase were due\nto currency exchange rates.  Currency exchange reduced the growth in Asia\nPacific and the Americas by approximately 0.5 points and five points,\nrespectively.*\n\nKnight continued, "The strong growth in futures is further evidence of\nthe strength of our brand and product lines around the world.  Growing\nconsumer demand for Nike products was particularly evident in our U.S.\nregion, where our futures growth reached the highest level in more than\nseven years."*\n\nRegional Highlights\n\nU.S.\n____\n\nDuring the first quarter, U.S. revenues increased 12 percent to $1.4\nbillion versus $1.2 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2004.
