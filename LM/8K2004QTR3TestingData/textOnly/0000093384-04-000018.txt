Gross\nprofit  percentage on product  sales was 44.4% in this year\'s second  quarter as\ncompared to 44.2% a year ago.\n\nResearch and  development  expenses for the second  quarter were $11.2  million,\ncompared to $9.3  million in the  year-ago  quarter,  and  selling,  general and\nadministrative  expenses were $11.9  million,  compared to $10.0 million in last\nyear\'s  second  quarter.  The  year-over-year  increases in  operating  expenses\nprimarily reflect  investments in engineering and marketing personnel to support\nfuture  revenue  growth,  litigation  costs and  tooling  costs for new  product\ndevelopments.\n\nOperating  income in the  second  quarter  of fiscal  2005 was $0.6  million  as\ncompared to $1.9 million in the year-ago  period.  Second quarter net income was\n$0.9 million, or $0.05 per share,  compared to $1.5 million, or $0.08 per share,\nin the second quarter of fiscal 2004.\n\nCash and liquid investments at August 31, 2004 were $182.0 million,  an increase\nof $12.3 million from $169.7 million at May 31, 2004. Tax refunds  totaling $6.9\nmillion  contributed  to the  increase  in cash and  liquid  investments  in the\nquarter.  Inventories  at August  31,  2004  totaled  $27.8  million  and remain\nappropriate  relative to expected demand. The Company has no bank debt, and book\nvalue per share was $14.47 as of August 31, 2004.\n\n"As announced on August 17th,  SMSC\'s second quarter  revenues were below normal\nseasonal  patterns  resulting  from a  general  slowdown  in orders  across  our\nbusinesses,   particularly  in  PC  I/O  products,  as  ODMs  rebalanced  excess\ninventories,"  said Steven J. Bilodeau,  Chairman and Chief  Executive  Officer.\n"However,  based on current  customer  demand,  we expect third quarter  product\nrevenues to show sequential growth."\n\nMr. Bilodeau added,  "Looking at second quarter revenues  compared to last year,\nnetworking and connectivity products produced strong growth of over 50% and 80%,\nrespectively.  In addition,  non-PC I/O revenues contributed 41% of total second\nquarter  product sales, as SMSC continues to execute on its goal of diversifying\nits product portfolio.\n\n"During the second quarter,  SMSC introduced two \'industry  first\' products with\nits USB2.0 2-port hub for portable and integrated  applications,  as well as its\nsuite of integrated industrial-temperature embedded I/O controllers. Also, early\nin September,  SMSC announced a comprehensive  line of USB2.0 hubs,  USB2.0 card\nreader,  USB2.0 PHY,  mobile super I/O and embedded  ethernet  controllers for a\nwide range of consumer and commercial connectivity solutions.  Our commitment to\ndriving product innovation,  as evidenced in these recent introductions,  should\nserve  us well in our  diversification  goal as we  target  a  broader  range of\nmarkets."\n\nBusiness Outlook:\n\nFor the third  quarter of fiscal 2005,  SMSC expects  revenues to be between $54\nmillion  and $57  million,  representing  a  sequential  increase in revenues of\napproximately  11%, at the midpoint of that range.  Gross profit  percentage  is\nexpected to be between 45% and 46%,  reflective  of product mix and a slowing of\ncost reductions due to tightened  supply  constraints.  Research and development\nexpenses  are  expected  to be between  $10.5  million  and $11.5  million,  and\nselling,  general and  administrative  expenses  are  expected to be between $11\nmillion and $12 million.  Amortization of acquired intangibles is expected to be\napproximately  $0.3  million.  Due  to  higher  interest  income  caused  by the\nincreased  cash  balance  and a change  in the mix of  taxable  and  non-taxable\ninvestments,  interest income is expected to be approximately $0.7 million.  The\neffective  tax rate is  estimated  to be between  26% and 27%,  and the  Company\nexpects third quarter net income to be between $0.10 and $0.14 per share.\n\nAbout SMSC:\n\nMany of the world\'s most successful global  technology  companies rely upon SMSC\nas a go-to resource for integrated  circuits and semiconductor  system solutions\nthat span analog, digital and mixed-signal technologies.
