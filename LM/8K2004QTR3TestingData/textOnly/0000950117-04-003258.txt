ANNOUNCES OPERATING RESULTS\n                 FOR QUARTER AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2004\n\nCHATTANOOGA, TN - September 9, 2004 - Covista Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ\nsymbol: CVST) today announced operating results for the three and six-month\nperiods ended July 31, 2004.\n\nFor the three months ended July 31, 2004, the Company reported a loss of\n$1,150,000 or $0.06 a share on revenues of $18,355,000 as compared with a loss\nof $885,000 or $0.05 per share on revenues of $21,457,000 for the prior year\'s\nfiscal period. The Company reported a loss of $3,150,000 or $0.18 per share on\nrevenues of $36,549,000 for the six months ended July 31, 2004, as compared with\na loss of $1,663,000 or $0.09 per share on revenues of $44,727,000 for the\ncomparable period in the prior fiscal year.\n\nThe overall revenue decrease is primarily related to a decline in the retail\ncommercial segment, partially offset by moderate growth in the KISS residential\nsegment.\n\nThe Company has previously announced that, subsequent to July 31, 2004, it had\nsuccessfully closed a transaction where it sold the majority of its retail\ncommercial customer base and selected assets to PAETEC Communications for cash.\n\nThe moderate growth in the KISS segment is primarily attributed to the marketing\nof local service to residential users in selected markets. While the Company has\nlaunched local services to the KISS residential segment in certain markets, it\nplans to expand the number of markets in which it intends to offer its local and\nlong distance bundled product offering.\n\nJohn Leach, Jr., Covista\'s President and Chief Executive Officer, stated,\n"Closing the transaction with PAETEC provides us with significant advantages as\nwe seek to navigate through pending uncertain regulatory waters. The transaction\nnot only strengthens our working capital position, but also enables us to\nimprove our geographic focus related to target customers as well as the\ninfrastructure and costs related to our switching network and back office\ncustomer support requirements."\n\nWe are providing the following consolidated summary of operations (unaudited)\nfor the three and six- month periods ended July 31, 2004 and 2003 (amounts and\nnumber of shares in thousands except for per share data):\n\n', u'\n', u'\n                                       Three-Months Ended July 31             Six-Months Ended July 31\n                                        2004                2003               2004               2003\n                                  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u'\nRevenues                                    $18,355             $21,457            $36,549           $44,727\nCost and expense                             19,406              22,251             39,509            46,223\nOperating loss                              (1,052)               (794)            (2,960)           (1,496)\nOther expense, net                             (98)                (91)              (190)             (167)\nNet loss                                    (1,150)               (885)            (3,150)           (1,663)\nComprehensive loss                         $(1,150)              $(885)           $(3,150)          $(1,663)\n                                  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBasic loss per common share                 $(0.06)             $(0.05)            $(0.18)           $(0.09)\nDiluted loss per common share               $(0.06)             $(0.05)            $(0.18)           $(0.09)\nAverage number of common shares\n         Basic                               17,822              17,783             17,822            17,783\n         Diluted                             17,822              17,783             17,822            17,783\n', u'\n', u'\n\n\nAbout Covista:\n\nCovista is a facilities-based provider of telecommunications services with a\nsubstantial customer base, principally residential and small sized businesses.\nIts products and services include a broad range of voice, data and Internet\nsolutions, including long distance and toll-free services, local dial tone and\nfeatures, calling cards, frame relay, Internet access, VPN, directory assistance\nand teleconferencing services.
