The next phase of our plan has already started and\ninvolves the rationalization of infrastructure globally. As part of this initiative,\nwe are combining our operations into three integrated businesses: Life Sciences,\ncomprising Medical and BioPharmaceuticals; Aeropower, comprising Aerospace and\nGeneral Industrial\'s Machinery & Equipment business; while our remaining\nIndustrial businesses will operate under the banner Pall Process Technologies,\ncomprising\nFood & Beverage, Fuels & Chemicals, Power Generation, Municipal Water\nand Microelectronics. We expect these changes will propel us to reach the high\nend of our CoRe goals. At the same time, we will achieve greater efficiencies\nand profit\ngrowth with this leaner, customer-centric structure.

The\nAdministrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender having submitted a\nCompetitive Bid whether or not its offer has been accepted and, if its offer has\nbeen accepted, of the amount of the Bid Loan or Bid Loans to be made by it on\nthe date of the applicable Bid Borrowing. Any Competitive Bid or portion thereof\nthat is not accepted by the Borrower by the applicable time specified in Section\n2.03(e) shall be deemed rejected.\n\n         (h) Notice of Eurodollar Rate. If any Bid Borrowing is to consist of\nEurodollar Margin Loans, the Administrative Agent shall determine the Eurodollar\nRate for the relevant Interest Period, and promptly after making such\ndetermination, shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that will be\nparticipating in such Bid Borrowing of such Eurodollar Rate.\n\n         (i) Funding of Bid Loans. Each Lender that has received notice pursuant\nto Section 2.03(g) that all or a portion of its Competitive Bid has been\naccepted by the Borrower shall make the amount of its Bid Loan(s) available to\nthe Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Administrative\nAgent's Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of the requested Bid\nBorrowing. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section\n4.02, the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the\nBorrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent.\n\n         (j) Notice of Range of Bids. After each Competitive Bid auction\npursuant to this Section 2.03, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender\nthat submitted a Competitive Bid in such auction of the ranges of bids submitted\n(without the bidder's name) and accepted for each Bid Loan and the aggregate\namount of each Bid Borrowing.\n\n                                       27\n", u"\n\n         2.04 LETTERS OF CREDIT.\n\n         (a) The Letter of Credit Commitment.\n\n                  (i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (A)\n         the L/C Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the Lenders\n         set forth in this Section 2.04, (1) from time to time on any Business\n         Day during the period from the Closing Date until the Letter of Credit\n         Expiration Date, to issue Letters of Credit for the account of the\n         Borrower or its Subsidiaries, and to amend or extend Letters of Credit\n         previously issued by it, in accordance with subsection (b) below, and\n         (2) to honor drawings under the Letters of Credit; and (B) the Lenders\n         severally agree to participate in Letters of Credit issued for the\n         account of the Borrower or its Subsidiaries and any drawings\n         thereunder; provided that after giving effect to any L/C Credit\n         Extension with respect to any Letter of Credit, (x) the Total\n         Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitments, (y) the\n         aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Committed Loans of any Lender, plus\n         such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all\n         L/C Obligations, plus such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the\n         Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such\n         Lender's Commitment, and (z) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C\n         Obligations shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit. Each\n         request by the Borrower for the issuance or amendment of a Letter of\n         Credit shall be deemed to be a representation by the Borrower that the\n         L/C Credit Extension so requested complies with the conditions set\n         forth in the proviso to the preceding sentence. Within the foregoing\n         limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower's\n         ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and\n         accordingly the Borrower may, during the foregoing period, obtain\n         Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that have expired or\n         that have been drawn upon and reimbursed. All Existing Letters of\n         Credit shall be deemed to have been issued pursuant hereto, and from\n         and after the Closing Date shall be subject to and governed by the\n         terms and conditions hereof.\n\n                  (ii) The L/C Issuer shall not issue any Letter of Credit, if:\n\n                           (A) subject to Section 2.04(b)(iii), the expiry date\n                  of such requested Letter of Credit would occur more than\n                  twelve months after the date of issuance or last extension,\n                  unless the Required Lenders have approved such expiry date; or\n\n                           (B) the expiry date of such requested Letter of\n                  Credit would occur after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date,\n                  unless all the Lenders have approved such expiry date.\n\n                  (iii) The L/C Issuer shall not be under any obligation to\n         issue any Letter of Credit if:\n\n                           (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental\n                  Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin\n                  or restrain the L/C Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit,\n                  or any Law applicable to the L/C Issuer or any request or\n                  directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any\n                  Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the L/C Issuer\n                  shall prohibit, or request that the L/C Issuer refrain from,\n                  the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of\n                  Credit in particular or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with\n                  respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or\n                  capital requirement (for which the L/C Issuer is not otherwise\n                  compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or\n                  shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost\n                  or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and\n                  which the L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it;\n\n                                       28\n", u'\n\n                           (B) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would\n                  violate one or more policies of the L/C Issuer;\n\n                           (C) such Letter of Credit is to be denominated in a\n                  currency other than Dollars;\n\n                           (D) such Letter of Credit contains any provisions for\n                  automatic reinstatement of the stated amount after any drawing\n                  thereunder; or\n\n                           (E) a default of any Lender\'s obligations to fund\n                  under Section 2.04(c) exists or any Lender is at such time a\n                  Defaulting Lender hereunder, unless the L/C Issuer has entered\n                  into satisfactory arrangements with the Borrower or such\n                  Lender to eliminate the L/C Issuer\'s risk with respect to such\n                  Lender.\n\n                  (iv) The L/C Issuer shall not amend any Letter of Credit if\n         the L/C Issuer would not be permitted at such time to issue such Letter\n         of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof.\n\n                  (v) The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any\n         Letter of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such\n         time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms\n         hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept\n         the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.\n\n                  (vi) The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with\n         respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents\n         associated therewith, and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits\n         and immunities (A) provided to the Administrative Agent in Article IX\n         with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer\n         in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be\n         issued by it and Issuer Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit\n         as fully as if the term "Administrative Agent" as used in Article IX\n         included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (B)\n         as additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C Issuer.\n\n                  (vii) The L/C Issuer shall, on a monthly basis, provide the\n         Lenders with a summary of all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the\n         date such summary is provided.\n\n         (b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit;\nAuto-Extension Letters of Credit.\n\n                                       29\n', u"\n\n                  (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the\n         case may be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered to the L/C\n         Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a\n         Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a\n         Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Promptly upon the Administrative\n         Agent's receipt of notice from the Borrower of its request for a Letter\n         of Credit, the Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of such\n         request. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the L/C\n         Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least\n         two Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative\n         Agent and the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in their\n         sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of\n         amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial\n         issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall\n         specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) the\n         proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall\n         be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the expiry date\n         thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the\n         documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing\n         thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by\n         such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (G) such other\n         matters as the L/C Issuer may require. In the case of a request for an\n         amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit\n         Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C\n         Issuer (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the proposed date of\n         amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of\n         the proposed amendment; and (D) such other matters as the L/C Issuer\n         may require. Additionally, the Borrower shall furnish to the L/C Issuer\n         and the Administrative Agent such other documents and information\n         pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment,\n         including any Issuer Documents, as the L/C Issuer or the Administrative\n         Agent may require.\n\n                  (ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit\n         Application, the L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent\n         (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received\n         a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower and, if\n         not, the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy\n         thereof. Unless the L/C Issuer has received written notice from any\n         Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, prior to the\n         requested issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit,\n         that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article IV shall\n         not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions\n         hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of\n         Credit for the account of the Borrower (or the applicable Subsidiary)\n         or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each\n         case in accordance with the L/C Issuer's usual and customary business\n         practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each\n         Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally\n         agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such\n         Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender's\n         Applicable Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit.\n\n                                       30\n", u'\n\n                  (iii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of\n         Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute\n         discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic\n         extension provisions (each, an "Auto-Extension Letter of Credit");\n         provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the\n         L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each\n         twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such\n         Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not\n         later than a day (the "Non-Extension Notice Date") in each such\n         twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit\n         is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower\n         shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for\n         any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been\n         issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not\n         require) the L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of\n         Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of\n         Credit Expiration Date; provided, however, that the L/C Issuer shall\n         not permit any such extension if (A) the L/C Issuer has determined that\n         it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to\n         issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the\n         terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of\n         Section 2.04(a) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may\n         be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five\n         Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the\n         Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to\n         permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender\n         or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified\n         in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing\n         the L/C Issuer not to permit such extension.\n\n                  (iv) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of\n         Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute\n         discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that permits the\n         automatic reinstatement of all or a portion of the stated amount\n         thereof after any drawing thereunder (each, an "Auto-Reinstatement\n         Letter of Credit"). Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the\n         Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C\n         Issuer to permit such reinstatement. Once an Auto-Reinstatement Letter\n         of Credit has been issued, except as provided in the following\n         sentence, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not\n         require) the L/C Issuer to reinstate all or a portion of the stated\n         amount thereof in accordance with the provisions of such Letter of\n         Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such Auto-Reinstatement\n         Letter of Credit permits the L/C Issuer to decline to reinstate all or\n         any portion of the stated amount thereof after a drawing thereunder by\n         giving notice of such non-reinstatement within a specified number of\n         days after such drawing (the "Non-Reinstatement Deadline"), the L/C\n         Issuer shall not permit such reinstatement if it has received a notice\n         (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is\n         five Business Days before the Non-Reinstatement Deadline (A) from the\n         Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to\n         permit such reinstatement or (B) from the Administrative Agent, any\n         Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions\n         specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied (treating such\n         reinstatement as an L/C Credit Extension for purposes of this clause)\n         and, in each case, directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such\n         reinstatement.\n\n                  (v) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any\n         amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect\n         thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver\n         to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy\n         of such Letter of Credit or amendment.\n\n                                       31\n', u'\n\n         (c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.\n\n                  (i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit\n         of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer\n         shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. Not\n         later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer\n         under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an "Honor Date"), the\n         Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative\n         Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing. If the Borrower\n         fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative\n         Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, the amount\n         of the unreimbursed drawing (the "Unreimbursed Amount"), and the amount\n         of such Lender\'s Applicable Percentage thereof. In such event, the\n         Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Committed Borrowing of\n         Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to\n         the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples\n         specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans,\n         but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate\n         Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than\n         the delivery of a Committed Loan Notice). Any notice given by the L/C\n         Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.04(c)(i)\n         may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided\n         that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the\n         conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.\n\n                  (ii) Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section\n         2.04(c)(i) make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the\n         account of the L/C Issuer at the Administrative Agent\'s Office in an\n         amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount\n         not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice\n         by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of\n         Section 2.04(c)(iii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall\n         be deemed to have made a Base Rate Committed Loan to the Borrower in\n         such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received\n         to the L/C Issuer.\n\n                  (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not\n         fully refinanced by a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because\n         the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any\n         other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the\n         L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount\n         that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable\n         on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the\n         Default Rate. In such event, each Lender\'s payment to the\n         Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to\n         Section 2.04(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its\n         participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance\n         from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under\n         this Section 2.04.\n\n                  (iv) Until each Lender funds its Committed Loan or L/C Advance\n         pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any\n         amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such\n         Lender\'s Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the\n         account of the L/C Issuer.\n\n                                       32\n', u"\n\n                  (v) Each Lender's obligation to make Committed Loans or L/C\n         Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of\n         Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.04(c), shall be absolute and\n         unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including\n         (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which\n         such Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other\n         Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of\n         a Default; (C) any reduction or termination of the Commitment; or (D)\n         any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any\n         of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender's obligation to\n         make Committed Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) is subject to the\n         conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the\n         Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance\n         shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to\n         reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C\n         Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided\n         herein.\n\n                  (vi) If any Lender fails to make available to the\n         Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount\n         required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions\n         of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(ii),\n         the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting\n         through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest\n         thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the\n         date on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer\n         at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and\n         a rate determined by the L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry\n         rules on interbank compensation. A certificate of the L/C Issuer\n         submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect\n         to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent\n         manifest error.\n\n         (d) Repayment of Participations.\n\n                  (i) At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under\n         any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender's L/C\n         Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.04(c),\n         if the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer\n         any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest\n         thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including\n         proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative\n         Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its\n         Applicable Percentage thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of\n         interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such\n         Lender's L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those\n         received by the Administrative Agent.\n\n                  (ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for\n         the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) is\n         required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in\n         Section 10.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the\n         L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the\n         Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Applicable\n         Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest\n         thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is\n         returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds\n         Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under\n         this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and\n         the termination of this Agreement.\n\n                                       33\n", u"\n\n         (e) Obligations Absolute.

The Borrower shall be\nconclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its\ncorrespondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.\n\n                                       34\n", u'\n\n         (f) Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in\npaying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have any\nresponsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates\nand documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or\ninquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of\nthe Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuer,\nthe Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any\ncorrespondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable to any\nLender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request\nor with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii)\nany action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful\nmisconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or\nenforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or\nIssuer Document. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions\nof any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of\nCredit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall\nnot, preclude the Borrower\'s pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have\nagainst the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None\nof the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related\nParties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall\nbe liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through\n(v) of Section 2.04(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the\ncontrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the L/C Issuer,\nand the L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the\nextent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages\nsuffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by the L/C\nIssuer\'s willful misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C Issuer\'s willful\nfailure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the\nbeneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the\nterms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation\nof the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face\nto be in substantial compliance, without responsibility for further\ninvestigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the\nL/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any\ninstrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a\nLetter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in\nwhole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.\n\n         (g) Cash Collateral.

Notwithstanding anything to the\ncontrary contained herein, upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any\nEvent of Default exists, all Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default\nRate.\n\n         (j) Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C\nIssuer.

Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due\nand payable on demand and are nonrefundable.\n\n         (k) Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of any conflict\nbetween the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof\nshall control.\n\n         (l) Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding that a\nLetter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any\nobligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, the Borrower shall be\nobligated to reimburse the L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under\nsuch Letter of Credit. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of\nLetters of Credit for the account of Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the\nBorrower, and that the Borrower\'s business derives substantial benefits from the\nbusinesses of such Subsidiaries.\n\n         2.05 SWING LINE LOANS.\n\n         (a) The Swing Line.

No such funding of risk\n         participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the\n         Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided\n         herein.\n\n                                       38\n", u"\n\n         (d) Repayment of Participations.\n\n                  (i) At any time after any Lender has purchased and funded a\n         risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender\n         receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line\n         Lender will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage of such\n         payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to\n         reflect the period of time during which such Lender's risk\n         participation was funded) in the same funds as those received by the\n         Swing Line Lender.\n\n                  (ii) If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in\n         respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to\n         be returned by the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances\n         described in Section 10.05 (including pursuant to any settlement\n         entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Lender\n         shall pay to the Swing Line Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof on\n         demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date\n         of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum\n         equal to the Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative Agent will make\n         such demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender. The obligations\n         of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of\n         the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.\n\n         (e) Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender. The Swing Line Lender\nshall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for interest on the Swing Line\nLoans. Until each Lender funds its Base Rate Committed Loan or risk\nparticipation pursuant to this Section 2.05 to refinance such Lender's\nApplicable Percentage of any Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such\nApplicable Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender.\n\n         (f) Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender. The Borrower shall make all\npayments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans directly\nto the Swing Line Lender.\n\n         2.06 PREPAYMENTS.\n\n         (a) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at any\ntime or from time to time voluntarily prepay Committed Loans in whole or in part\nwithout premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be received by\nthe Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (A) three Business Days prior\nto any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Committed Loans and (B) on the date\nof prepayment of Base Rate Committed Loans; (ii) any prepayment of Eurodollar\nRate Committed Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole\nmultiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (iii) any prepayment of Base Rate\nCommitted Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple\nof $100,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal\namount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and\namount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Committed Loans to be prepaid. The\nAdministrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each\nsuch notice, and of the amount of such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such\nprepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make\nsuch prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and\npayable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan\nshall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together\nwith any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. Each such\nprepayment shall be applied to the Committed Loans of the Lenders in accordance\nwith their respective Applicable Percentages.\n\n                                       39\n", u'\n\n         (b) No Bid Loan may be prepaid without the prior consent of the\napplicable Bid Loan Lender.\n\n         (c) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Swing Line Lender (with a copy\nto the Administrative Agent), at any time or from time to time, voluntarily\nprepay Swing Line Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided\nthat (i) such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the\nAdministrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of the prepayment, and\n(ii) any such prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $250,000.\nEach such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment. If such\nnotice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the\npayment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date\nspecified therein.\n\n         (d) If for any reason the Total Outstandings at any time exceed the\nAggregate Commitments then in effect, the Borrower shall immediately prepay\nLoans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal\nto such excess; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to\nCash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.06(d) unless\nafter the prepayment in full of the Committed Loans and Swing Line Loans the\nTotal Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect.\n\n         2.07 TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS. The Borrower may, upon\nnotice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Commitments, or from\ntime to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments; provided that (i) any\nsuch notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00\na.m. five Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any\nsuch partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or any\nwhole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (iii) the Borrower shall not\nterminate or reduce the Aggregate Commitments if, after giving effect thereto\nand to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Outstandings would exceed\nthe Aggregate Commitments, and (iv) if, after giving effect to any reduction of\nthe Aggregate Commitments, the Bid Loan Sublimit, the Letter of Credit Sublimit\nor the Swing Line Sublimit exceeds the amount of the Aggregate Commitments, such\nSublimit shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess. The\nAdministrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such notice of\ntermination or reduction of the Aggregate Commitments. Any reduction of the\nAggregate Commitments shall be applied to the Commitment of each Lender\naccording to its Applicable Percentage. All fees accrued until the effective\ndate of any termination of the Aggregate Commitments shall be paid on the\neffective date of such termination.\n\n         2.08 REPAYMENT OF LOANS.\n\n         (a) The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date the\naggregate principal amount of Committed Loans outstanding on such date.\n\n         (b) The Borrower shall repay each Bid Loan on the last day of the\nInterest Period in respect thereof.\n\n                                       40\n', u'\n\n         (c) The Borrower shall repay each Swing Line Loan on the earlier to\noccur of (i) the date ten Business Days after such Loan is made and (ii) the\nMaturity Date.\n\n         2.09 INTEREST.\n\n         (a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each\nEurodollar Rate Committed Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal\namount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the\nEurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; (ii) each\nBase Rate Committed Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount\nthereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base\nRate; (iii) each Bid Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal\namount thereof for the Interest Period therefor at a rate per annum equal to the\nEurodollar Rate for such Interest Period plus (or minus) the Eurodollar Bid\nMargin, or at the Absolute Rate for such Interest Period, as the case may be;\nand (iv) each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal\namount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to\nthe Base Rate.\n\n         (b)      (i) If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid\n         when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at\n         stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall\n         thereafter bear interest at an interest rate per annum at all times\n         equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable\n         Laws.\n\n                  (ii) If any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable\n         by the Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (without\n         regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by\n         acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the Required\n         Lenders, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at an interest rate\n         per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent\n         permitted by applicable Laws.\n\n                  (iii) Upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any\n         Event of Default exists, the Borrower shall pay interest on the\n         principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at an\n         interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the\n         fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.\n\n                  (iv) Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts\n         (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon\n         demand.\n\n         (c) Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each\nInterest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be\nspecified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with\nthe terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the\ncommencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.\n\n         2.10 FEES. In addition to certain fees described in subsections (i) and\n(j) of Section 2.04:\n\n                                       41\n', u'\n\n         (a) Facility Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent\nfor the account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a\nfacility fee equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount of the\nAggregate Commitments (or, if the Aggregate Commitments have terminated, on the\nOutstanding Amount of all Committed Loans, Swing Line Loans and L/C\nObligations), regardless of usage. The facility fee shall accrue at all times\nduring the Availability Period (and thereafter so long as any Committed Loans,\nSwing Line Loans or L/C Obligations remain outstanding), including at any time\nduring which one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall\nbe due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March,\nJune, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after\nthe Closing Date, and on the Maturity Date (and, if applicable, thereafter on\ndemand). The facility fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there\nis any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount\nshall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each\nperiod during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.\n\n         (b) Other Fees. (i) The Borrower shall pay to the Arranger and the\nAdministrative Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts and\nat the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when\npaid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.\n\n                  (ii) The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall\n         have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the\n         times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall\n         not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.\n\n         2.11 COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES. All computations of interest for\nBase Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by JPMorgan\'s "prime rate"\nshall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and\nactual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made\non the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more\nfees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a\n365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan\nis made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on\nwhich the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on\nthe same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.13(a), bear\ninterest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an\ninterest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,\nabsent manifest error.\n\n         2.12 EVIDENCE OF DEBT.\n\n         (a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one\nor more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative\nAgent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by\nthe Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest\nerror of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower\nand the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in\ndoing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the\nBorrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In\nthe event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any\nLender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of\nsuch matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control\nin the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through\nthe Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender\n(through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender\'s\nLoans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules\nto its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and\nmaturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.\n\n                                       42\n', u"\n\n         (b) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection\n(a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with\nits usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by\nsuch Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans. In the\nevent of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the\nAdministrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of\nsuch matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control\nin the absence of manifest error.\n\n         2.13 PAYMENTS GENERALLY; ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S CLAWBACK.\n\n         (a) General. All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made\nwithout condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or\nsetoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the\nBorrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of\nthe respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative\nAgent's Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00\np.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly\ndistribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share\nas provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer\nto such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative\nAgent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business\nDay and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment\nto be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day,\npayment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of\ntime shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.\n\n         (b) (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless\nthe Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the\nproposed date of any Committed Borrowing that such Lender will not make\navailable to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Committed\nBorrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such\nshare available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 and may, in\nreliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding\namount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the\napplicable Committed Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the\napplicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative\nAgent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available\nfunds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such\namount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to\nthe Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such\nLender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the\nAdministrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank\ncompensation and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the\ninterest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender\nshall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an\noverlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the\nBorrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If\nsuch Lender pays its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing to the\nAdministrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's\nCommitted Loan included in such Committed Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower\nshall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender\nthat shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.\n\n                                       43\n", u'\n\n         (ii) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless\nthe Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to\nthe date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account\nof the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that the Borrower will not make such\npayment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such\npayment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such\nassumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the\namount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment,\nthen each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees\nto repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so\ndistributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds\nwith interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is\ndistributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative\nAgent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the\nAdministrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank\ncompensation.\n\n         A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with\nrespect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive,\nabsent manifest error.\n\n         (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes\navailable to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such\nLender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such\nfunds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because\nthe conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are\nnot satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative\nAgent shall promptly return such funds (in like funds as received from such\nLender) to such Lender, without interest.\n\n         (d) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders\nhereunder to make Committed Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit\nand Swing Line Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are\nseveral and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Committed Loan, to\nfund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any\ndate required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding\nobligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the\nfailure of any other Lender to so make its Committed Loan, to purchase its\nparticipation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c).\n\n         (e) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any\nLender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to\nconstitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain\nthe funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.\n\n                                       44\n', u"\n\n         2.14 SHARING OF PAYMENTS BY LENDERS. If any Lender shall, by exercising\nany right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of\nany principal of or interest on any of the Committed Loans made by it, or the\nparticipations in L/C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by it resulting in\nsuch Lender's receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such\nCommitted Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its\npro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such\ngreater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and\n(b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Committed Loans and\nsubparticipations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans of the other Lenders,\nor make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all\nsuch payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the\naggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective\nCommitted Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that:\n\n                  (i) if any such participations or subparticipations are\n         purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is\n         recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded\n         and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without\n         interest; and\n\n                  (ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to\n         apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in\n         accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment\n         obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of\n         a participation in any of its Committed Loans or subparticipations in\n         L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans to any assignee or participant,\n         other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the\n         provisions of this Section shall apply).\n\n         Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it\nmay effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a\nparticipation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such\nLoan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation\nas fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the\namount of such participation.\n\n         2.15 INCREASE IN COMMITMENTS.\n\n         (a) Request for Increase. Provided there exists no Default, upon notice\nto the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), the\nBorrower may request an increase in the Aggregate Commitments by an amount (for\nall such requests) not exceeding $50,000,000; provided that any such request for\nan increase shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000. At the time of sending\nsuch notice, the Borrower (in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall\nspecify the time period within which each Lender is requested to respond (which\nshall in no event be less than ten Business Days from the date of delivery of\nsuch notice to the Lenders).\n\n         (b) Lender Elections to Increase. Each Lender shall notify the\nAdministrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to\nincrease its Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than,\nor less than its Applicable Percentage of such requested increase. Any Lender\nnot responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to\nincrease its Commitment.\n\n                                       45\n", u'\n\n         (c) Notification by Administrative Agent; Additional Lenders. The\nAdministrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and each Lender of the Lenders\'\nresponses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a\nrequested increase and subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and\nthe L/C Issuer (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld), the\nBorrower may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders\npursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the\nAdministrative Agent and its counsel.\n\n         (d) Effective Date and Allocations. If the Aggregate Commitments are\nincreased in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent and the\nBorrower shall determine the effective date (the "Increase Effective Date") and\nthe final allocation of such increase. The Administrative Agent shall promptly\nnotify the Borrower and the Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and\nthe Increase Effective Date.\n\n         (e) Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase. As a condition precedent\nto such increase, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a\ncertificate of each Loan Party dated as of the Increase Effective Date (in\nsufficient copies for each Lender) signed by a Responsible Officer of such Loan\nParty (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Loan Party\napproving or consenting to such increase, and (ii) in the case of the Borrower,\ncertifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, (A) the\nrepresentations and warranties contained in Article V and the other Loan\nDocuments are true and correct on and as of the Extension Effective Date, except\nto the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an\nearlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlier date,\nand except that for purposes of this Section 2.15, the representations and\nwarranties contained in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 5.05 shall be deemed\nto refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to clauses (a) and\n(b), respectively, of Section 6.01, and (B) no Default exists. The Borrower\nshall prepay any Committed Loans outstanding on the Increase Effective Date (and\npay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05) to the extent\nnecessary to keep the outstanding Committed Loans ratable with any revised\nApplicable Percentages arising from any nonratable increase in the Commitments\nunder this Section.\n\n         (f) Conflicting Provisions. This Section shall supersede any provisions\nin Sections 2.14 or 10.01 to the contrary.\n\n                                  ARTICLE III\n                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY\n\n         3.01 TAXES.\n\n         (a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of\nany obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall\nbe made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any\nIndemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, provided that if the Borrower shall be\nrequired by applicable law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other\nTaxes) from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as\nnecessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions\napplicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative\nAgent, Lender or L/C Issuer, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the\nsum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower\nshall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall timely pay the full\namount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with\napplicable law.\n\n                                       46\n', u'\n\n         (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. Without limiting the\nprovisions of subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other\nTaxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.\n\n         (c) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify the\nAdministrative Agent, each Lender and the L/C Issuer, within 10 days after\ndemand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes\n(including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or\nattributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative\nAgent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and any penalties,\ninterest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto,\nwhether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally\nimposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to\nthe amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or\nthe L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the\nAdministrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the L/C\nIssuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.\n\n         (d) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of\nIndemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority,\nthe Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a\ncertified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing\nsuch payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of\nsuch payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.\n\n         (e) Status of Lenders. Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an\nexemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction\nin which the Borrower is resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such\njurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other\nLoan Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative\nAgent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably\nrequested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed\nand executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such\npayments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In\naddition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent,\nshall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or\nreasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable\nthe Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender\nis subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.\n\n         Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the\nBorrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender\nshall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of\ncopies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which\nsuch Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time\nthereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but\nonly if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the\nfollowing is applicable:\n\n                                       47\n', u'\n\n                  (i) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form\n         W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to\n         which the United States is a party,\n\n                  (ii) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form\n         W-8ECI,\n\n                  (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of\n         the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code,\n         (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a\n         "bank" within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a\n         "10 percent shareholder" of the Borrower within the meaning of section\n         881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a "controlled foreign corporation"\n         described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly completed\n         copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or\n\n                  (iv) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis\n         for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal\n         withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary\n         documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the\n         Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.\n\n         (f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If the Administrative Agent, any\nLender or the L/C Issuer determines, in its sole discretion, that it has\nreceived a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been\nindemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid\nadditional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an\namount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made,\nor additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to\nthe Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket\nexpenses of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case\nmay be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant\nGovernmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrower,\nupon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer,\nagrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties,\ninterest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the\nAdministrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer in the event the\nAdministrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer is required to repay such\nrefund to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to\nrequire the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer to make available\nits tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems\nconfidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.\n\n         3.02 ILLEGALITY. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it\nunlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful,\nfor any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund\nEurodollar Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the\nEurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions\non the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of,\nDollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender\nto the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender\nto make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Committed\nLoans to Eurodollar Rate Committed Loans shall be suspended until such Lender\nnotifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving\nrise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the\nBorrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative\nAgent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such\nLender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period\ntherefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate\nLoans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to\nmaintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the\nBorrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.\n\n                                       48\n', u'\n\n         3.03 INABILITY TO DETERMINE RATES. If the Required Lenders determine\nthat for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or\na conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) Dollar deposits are not being\noffered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable\namount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) adequate and\nreasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any\nrequested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Committed\nLoan, or (c) the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect\nto a proposed Eurodollar Rate Committed Loan does not adequately and fairly\nreflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent\nwill promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation\nof the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended\nuntil the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders)\nrevokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any\npending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar\nRate Committed Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such\nrequest into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the\namount specified therein.\n\n         3.04 INCREASED COSTS; RESERVES ON EURODOLLAR RATE LOANS.\n\n         (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:\n\n                  (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special\n         deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement\n         against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit\n         extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve\n         requirement contemplated by Section 3.04(e)) or the L/C Issuer;\n\n                  (ii) subject any Lender or the L/C Issuer to any tax of any\n         kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit,\n         any participation in a Letter of Credit or any Eurodollar Loan made by\n         it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or the\n         L/C Issuer in respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other\n         Taxes covered by Section 3.01 and the imposition of, or any change in\n         the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender or the L/C\n         Issuer); or\n\n                  (iii) impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London\n         interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this\n         Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of\n         Credit or participation therein;\n\nand the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such\nLender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its\nobligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the\nL/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or\nof maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of\nCredit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such\nLender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other\namount) then, upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Borrower will\npay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount\nor amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be,\nfor such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.\n\n                                       49\n', u'\n\n         (b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines\nthat any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer or any Lending\nOffice of such Lender or such Lender\'s or the L/C Issuer\'s holding company, if\nany, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the\nrate of return on such Lender\'s or the L/C Issuer\'s capital or on the capital of\nsuch Lender\'s or the L/C Issuer\'s holding company, if any, as a consequence of\nthis Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or\nparticipations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of\nCredit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the\nL/C Issuer or such Lender\'s or the L/C Issuer\'s holding company could have\nachieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender\'s or\nthe L/C Issuer\'s policies and the policies of such Lender\'s or the L/C Issuer\'s\nholding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the\nBorrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such\nadditional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or\nsuch Lender\'s or the L/C Issuer\'s holding company for any such reduction\nsuffered.\n\n         (c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender or the\nL/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such\nLender or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as\nspecified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower\nshall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or\nthe L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such\ncertificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.\n\n         (d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or\nthe L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of\nthis Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender\'s or the L/C Issuer\'s\nright to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be\nrequired to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing\nprovisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions\nsuffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C\nIssuer, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving\nrise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender\'s or the L/C\nIssuer\'s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in\nLaw giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the\nnine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of\nretroactive effect thereof).\n\n         (e) Reserves on Eurodollar Rate Loans. The Borrower shall pay to each\nLender, as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with\nrespect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds\nor deposits (currently known as "Eurocurrency liabilities"), additional interest\non the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual\ncosts of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by\nsuch Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall\nbe due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan,\nprovided the Borrower shall have received at least 10 days\' prior notice (with a\ncopy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender.\nIf a Lender fails to give notice 10 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment\nDate, such additional interest shall be due and payable 10 days from receipt of\nsuch notice.\n\n                                       50\n', u'\n\n         3.05 COMPENSATION FOR LOSSES. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to\nthe Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly\ncompensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or\nexpense incurred by it as a result of:\n\n                  (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any\n         Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of\n         the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory,\n         automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);\n\n                  (b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the\n         failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or\n         convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the\n         amount notified by the Borrower; or\n\n                  (c) any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other\n         than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a\n         request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 10.13;\n\nincluding any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from\nthe liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or\nfrom fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.\nThe Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such\nLender in connection with the foregoing.\n\nFor purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under\nthis Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar\nRate Committed Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a\nmatching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market\nfor a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such\nEurodollar Rate Committed Loan was in fact so funded.\n\n         3.06 MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS; REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS.\n\n         (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests\ncompensation under Section 3.04, or the Borrower is required to pay any\nadditional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of\nany Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to\nSection 3.02, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a\ndifferent Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign\nits rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or\naffiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment\n(i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04,\nas the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant\nto Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such\nLender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be\ndisadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable\ncosts and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such\ndesignation or assignment.\n\n         (b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under\nSection 3.04, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any\nLender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to\nSection 3.01, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section\n10.13.\n\n                                       51\n', u"\n\n         3.07 SURVIVAL. All of the Borrower's obligations under this Article III\nshall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all\nother Obligations hereunder.\n\n                                   ARTICLE IV\n                    CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO CREDIT EXTENSIONS\n\n         4.01 CONDITIONS OF INITIAL CREDIT EXTENSION.

("Gelman"), a subsidiary acquired by the Pall Corporation (the "Company" or\n"Pall") in February 1997. The action sought to compel Gelman to investigate and\nremediate contamination near Gelman\'s Ann Arbor facility and requested\nreimbursement of costs the State had expended in investigating the\ncontamination, which the State alleged was caused by Gelman\'s disposal of waste\nwater from its manufacturing process. Pursuant to a consent judgment entered\ninto by Gelman and the State in October 1992 (amended September 1996 and October\n1999), which resolved that litigation, Gelman is remediating the contamination\nwithout admitting wrongdoing. In February 2000, the State Assistant Attorney\nGeneral filed a Motion to Enforce Consent Judgment in the Court seeking\napproximately $4,900,000 in stipulated penalties for the alleged violations of\nthe consent judgment and additional injunctive relief. Gelman disputed these\nassertions. Following an evidentiary hearing in July 2000, the Court took the\nmatter of penalties "under advisement." The Court issued a Remediation\nEnforcement Order requiring Gelman to submit and implement a detailed plan that\nwill reduce the contamination to acceptable levels within five years. The\nCompany\'s plan has been submitted to, and approved by, both the Court and the\nState. In February 2004, the Court instructed the Company to submit its Final\nFeasibility Study describing how it intends to address an area of groundwater\ncontamination not addressed by the previously approved plan. The Company has\nsubmitted its Feasibility Study as instructed. The Court has expressed its\nsatisfaction with the Company\'s progress.\n\nIn correspondence dated June 5, 2001, the State asserted that additional\nstipulated penalties in the amount of $142,000 were owed for a separate alleged\nviolation of the consent judgment. The Court found that a "substantial basis"\nfor Gelman\'s position existed and again took the State\'s request "under\nadvisement", pending the results of certain groundwater monitoring data. Those\ndata have been submitted to the Court, but no ruling has been issued. On August\n9, 2001, the State made a written demand for reimbursement of $227,000 it has\nallegedly incurred for groundwater monitoring. Gelman considers this claim\nbarred by the consent judgment.\n\nOn May 12, 2004, the City of Ann Arbor filed a lawsuit against Gelman Sciences,\nInc. d/b/a Pall Life Sciences in Washtenaw County Circuit Court. The City\'s suit\nseeks damages, including the cost of replacing a municipal water supply well\nallegedly affected by the 1,4-dioxane groundwater contamination, as well as\ninjunctive relief in the form of an order requiring Pall Life Sciences to\nremediate the soil and groundwater beneath the City. The contaminant levels\nallegedly detected in the municipal well at issue, however, are well below\napplicable cleanup standards and the Company will vigorously defend against the\nclaim.\n\nOn June 25, 2004, the Company was sued in the United States District Court for\nthe Eastern District of Michigan by a private plaintiff in connection with the\ngroundwater contamination. The complaint seeks both money damages and injunctive\nrelief requiring remediation of the contamination. The plaintiff also seeks to\nrepresent a larger class of property owners and residents within the area\nplaintiff claims is affected by the groundwater contamination. The Company does\nnot believe that there is substantive merit to the named plaintiff\'s claims or a\nbasis for class certification. The Company will vigorously defend the lawsuit.\n\n\n                                       1\n\n', u"\n\nPINELLAS PARK\n\nIn 1995, as part of facility closure, an environmental site assessment was\nconducted to evaluate any soil and groundwater impacts from chemicals that may\nhave been used at the Pinellas Park facility during the previous 24-year period\nof manufacturing and testing operations conducted at the facility. MIBK (methyl\nisobutyl ketone) concentrations in groundwater were found to be higher than\nregulatory levels. Soil excavation was conducted in 1998 and subsequent\ngroundwater sampling in the bubble point area showed MIBK concentrations below\nthe regulatory level.\n\nIn October 2000, environmental consultants for a prospective buyer of the\nproperty found groundwater contamination outside the building, but on Pall's\nproperty. The contamination in the groundwater consisted of chlorinated solvents\n(perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene) and their breakdown products\n(cis-1,2-dichloroethene, trans-1,2-dichloroethene, vinyl chloride) in excess of\nregulatory levels. In October 2001, a Site Assessment Report (SAR) was submitted\nto the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), which showed\ndetails of contamination locations and concentrations.\n\nIn July, 2002 a Supplemental Contamination Assessment Plan (SCAP) and an Interim\nRemedial Action Plan (IRAP) were prepared by Pall's consultants/contractors and\nsubmitted to FDEP. A revised IRAP was submitted by Pall in December, 2003, and\nit was accepted by the FDER in January, 2004. A Remedial Action Plan (RAP) was\nsubmitted in June, 2004, and approval and the start of work pursuant to this RAP\nis expected in the Fall of 2004.\n\n\n30 SEA CLIFF\n\nA March, 1994 report indicated contamination at a neighboring site to the Pall\nfacility, and later reports found both shallow and intermediate zone\ncontamination. In 2000, Pall entered into a Consent Judgment with the New York\nState Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), and completed a Phase\nII Remedial Investigation.\n\nThe NYSDEC has finalized the Record of Decision (ROD) for the shallow\ngroundwater zone termed OU-1 and Pall has signed an Order on Consent for OU-1 to\nbe effective July 5, 2004. This Order requires Pall to submit a Work Plan for a\nRemedial Investigation/Feasibility Study, Interim Remedial Measures, Remedial\nAction and Operation & Maintenance.\n\nThe deeper groundwater zone (OU-2) ROD has been deferred by the NYSDEC until\nafter additional data are available to delineate contamination and select an\nappropriate remedy. Pall has initiated discussions with Photocircuits regarding\nentering into a joint OU-2 Order on Consent.\n\n\n\n                                       2\n", u'\n\nROSEN SITE\n\nRosen is an EPA Superfund Site. The EPA named several Potentially Responsible\nParties ("PRP") to clean up the site and the PRP\'s in turn brought a civil\naction against Pall Trinity Microcorp and others to participate in the site\nclean up (Cooper vs Agway). In conjunction with settling the Cooper v. Agway\nprivate-party litigation, Pall and the nine other defendants entered into a\nConsent Decree with the EPA to complete the site remedial tasks required by EPA\nin its Record of Decision. At the time of the Consent Decree, the Group\'s\nconsultants estimated future site costs at approximately $2,000,000. The Group\ndetermined to allocate those costs per capita among the 10 parties, which came\nto an estimated $200,000 per party, exclusive of legal fees. In August 2001,\nPall was able to finalize a settlement of its insurance claims against\nAetna/Travelers for $200,000. Work under the Consent Decree was largely\ncompleted in late 2002. Pall has paid in more than was estimated at the time of\nthe Consent Decree, due to EPA-mandated cost increases Remaining Group costs to\nPall are not currently expected to exceed $50,000 (including net recovery from\nnon-participants).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                       3\n', u'\n\n\n                                                                   SCHEDULE 5.11\n\n                             TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS\n\nGERMANY:   A number of the Borrower\'s German Subsidiaries are party to\n           one of several so-called "Organschafts". Effectively, an\n           Organschaft is an agreement that enables a group of commonly\n           controlled legal entities to "pool" their profits and losses\n           such that losses of one or more entities can be used to offset\n           profits of one or more other entities. The ultimate effect is\n           not dissimilar to US Consolidated Return rules.\n\n\nUK:        Although there is no requirement for a formal agreement, all\n           commonly controlled UK Subsidiaries of the Borrower can avail\n           themselves of so-called Group Relief provisions. Such\n           provisions allow subsidiaries to "surrender losses" (and the\n           attendant tax benefit) to profitable subsidiaries within the\n           Group thereby minimizing the overall tax burden of the Group.\n           Again, the ultimate effect is not dissimilar to US\n           Consolidated Return rules.\n\nNOTE:  The Borrower IS NOT party to any of the agreement/arrangements outlined\n       above.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                       1\n', u'\n\n\n                                                                   SCHEDULE 5.13\n\n                     SUBSIDIARIES; OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS;\n                        EQUITY INTERESTS IN THE BORROWER\n\n', u'\n', u'\nDOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES:                          ACTIVE\n', u' ', u' ', u'\n                           Schenk Filter Systems, Inc.

If and to the extent that the obligations of Applicant under this\nparagraph are unenforceable for any reason, Applicant shall make the maximum\ncontribution to the Costs permissible under applicable law.\n\n(c) The liability of Issuer (or any other Indemnified Person) under, in\nconnection with and/or arising out of this Agreement or the Credit (or any\npre-advice), regardless of the form or legal grounds of the action or\nproceeding, shall be limited to any direct damages suffered by Applicant that\nare caused directly by Issuer\'s gross negligence or willful misconduct in (i)\nhonoring a presentation that does not at least substantially comply with the\nCredit, (ii) failing to honor a presentation that strictly complies with the\nCredit or (iii) retaining Drawing Documents presented under the Credit.
