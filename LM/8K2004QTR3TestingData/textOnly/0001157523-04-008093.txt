Operating income was 31\npercent of net sales in the second quarter and net income represented a 26\npercent after-tax-margin. Semtech generated $21.4 million of operating cash flow\nin the second quarter and spent $13.0 million to buy back 619,000 shares of its\ncommon stock.\n     Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 were $68.3 million, up\n53 percent from $44.6 million in the prior year second quarter. As a result of\nhigher sales and record gross margin, net income for the second quarter of\nfiscal year 2005 was $17.4 million or 22 cents per diluted share. Net income for\nthe second quarter of last year was $2.4 million or 3 cents per diluted share,\nwhich included a pre-tax charge of $6.8 million or net-of-tax 7 cents per\ndiluted share impact related to the Company\'s calling of its convertible\nsubordinated notes.\n     For the first six months of fiscal year 2005, net sales were up 47 percent\nto $130.2 million and net income nearly tripled to $32.2 million or 41 cents per\ndiluted share. Net sales in the first six months of fiscal year 2004 were $88.6\nmillion and net income was $10.7 million or 14 cents per share.\n     New orders in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 exceeded shipments for\nthe period, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of greater than 1:1. The strongest\ngrowth came from the Company\'s timing and synchronization or SETS product line\nused in high-speed communications, which saw new orders grow 32 percent over the\nfirst quarter. The Human Input Device (HID) unit also saw meaningful order\ngrowth, due in part to a new design win for the MicroBuddy(R) device being used\nin a high volume digital video recorder.\n     Net sales were up 10 percent sequentially in the second quarter of fiscal\nyear 2005 compared to the first quarter, driven by growth in Power Management,\nHID, SETS, and Protection products. Shipments of Semtech\'s two largest product\nlines, Power Management and Protection, are both up more than 50 percent\ncompared to the prior year period. The expansion in sales reflected ongoing\ndemand tied to cellular handsets and consumer electronics, as well as a modest\nrecovery in the computer segment.\n     Jason Carlson, Semtech\'s President and Chief Executive Officer commented,\n"I was most pleased with the new orders and shipment levels achieved by our SETS\nproduct line in the second quarter. The emerging product lines of SETS and HID\nhave been areas of investment by Semtech for more than 4 years. In the case of\nSETS, we are penetrating a relatively new end-market for Semtech, where HID\nrepresents increased content in portable applications we are already\nsupporting."\n\n     Third Quarter Outlook\n\n     Semtech estimates that net sales for the third quarter that ends October\n31, 2004 will be up 3 to 5 percent over the second quarter. Turns orders (orders\nreceived and shipped in the same quarter) of approximately 32 percent are\nrequired to achieve this forecast. Earnings in the third quarter are forecasted\nto be 23 cents per diluted share. Per the Company\'s fiscal calendar, the third\nquarter of fiscal year 2005 will be a 14-week quarter.\n\n     About Semtech\n\n     Semtech Corporation is a leading supplier of analog and mixed-signal\nsemiconductors used in a wide range of computer, industrial and communication\napplications.\n\n     Safe Harbor Provision\n\n     Statements contained in this release that are not historical facts are\nforward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995.
