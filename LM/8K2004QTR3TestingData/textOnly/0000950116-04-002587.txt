(Nasdaq: DEBS), a leading\nteen apparel retailer, today reported financial results for the second quarter\nand six months ended July 31, 2004.\n\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2005, net sales were $72.8 million compared to\n$73.0 million in the second quarter a year ago. Gross profit, which is net of\nbuying and occupancy costs, was $25.4 million resulting in a gross margin of\n34.8% for the period versus gross profit of $22.7 million and a 31.2% gross\nmargin in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. The increase in gross profit was\ndue primarily to a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales compared to\nthe prior year period. Second quarter net income increased to $4.6 million\ncompared to $2.7 million in the prior year, while diluted earnings per share\nincreased to $0.34 compared to $0.20 a year ago. The increase in net income and\nnet income per diluted share was due primarily to the aforementioned increase in\ngross profit as well as a reduction in selling and administrative expenses.\n\nAs of July 31, 2004, the Company had $168.2 million in cash, shareholders\'\nequity of $181.6 million, and no debt.\n\nMarvin Rounick, President and CEO of Deb Shops stated, "We are pleased with our\nsecond quarter earnings performance particularly as our results once again\nexceeded expectations. We continued to benefit from our tight inventory\nmanagement and cost control which allowed us to translate approximately flat\nsales growth during the quarter into a 70% increase in earnings per share. As we\nhead into the back half of fiscal 2005 we are continuing to focus on executing\nour strategy and building on our positive earnings momentum."\n\nNet sales for the first six months of fiscal 2005 increased 1.9% to $145.9\nmillion from $143.2 million for the comparable prior year period. Gross profit,\n\n\n\n\n', u'\n\nwhich is net of buying and occupancy costs, was $44.5 million resulting in a\ngross margin of 30.5% for the first six months of fiscal 2005 versus gross\nprofit of $40.5 million and a 28.3% gross margin in the comparable prior year\nperiod. Net income was $5.5 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, versus $3.0\nmillion, or $0.22 per diluted share, in the first half of fiscal 2004. The\nincrease in gross profit, net income and net income per diluted share was due\nprimarily to a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales compared to the\nprior year period.\n\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2005, Deb Shops opened one new store,\nremodeled one existing location, and closed three stores.\n\nBarry Susson, CFO of Deb Shops added, "Year-to-date, we have achieved meaningful\ngains throughout our business highlighted by significant improvements in gross\nmargin, operating margin, and net income. During that time period we also\ndeclared $0.65 per share in cash dividends, while maintaining what we believe to\nbe one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. We continue to believe\nthat we are well-positioned to continue to deliver improved financial\nperformance for the remainder of the year."\n\nBased on current information, Deb Shops expects fiscal 2005 sales to be in the\nrange of $300 million to $310 million, versus prior guidance of $310 million to\n$320 million. This is based on a projected low-single digit comparable store\nsales increase for the second half of the year and net new store growth of\nbetween four and six stores. Consistent with prior guidance, fiscal 2005 diluted\nearnings per share are expected to range from $1.20 to $1.30.\n\nDeb Shops, Inc. is a national specialty retailer of fashionable apparel, shoes\nand accessories for juniors in both regular and plus sizes. The Company\ncurrently operates 327 specialty apparel stores in 41 states under the DEB and\nTops \'n Bottoms names.\n\nThe Company has made in this release, and from time to time may otherwise make,\n"forward-looking statements" (as that term is defined under federal securities\nlaws) concerning the Company\'s future operations, performance, profitability,\nrevenues, expenses, earnings and financial condition.
