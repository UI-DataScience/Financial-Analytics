Let me walk you through the key\noperating results for the second quarter and six months: ', u'\n', u' MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" ', u'\n', u'Second Quarter ', u'\n', u' MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" ', u'\n', u'The following comments relate to the\nsecond quarter ended August 1, 2004: ', u'\n', u' MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" ', u'\n', u'Net sales increased 0.8% to $109.6\nmillion, while same-store sales rose approximately 0.1%. We believe that, compared to\nlast year, sales were impacted by higher gasoline prices that affected discretionary\nspending, the absence of Federal Income tax rebates distributed during the summer of last\nyear, the shift of a Texas sales tax \x93holiday\x94 from July last year to August this year,\ngenerally much cooler weather patterns that impacted sales of warm weather products such\nas fans, and the timing of a back-to-school advertising circular for the Duckwall\ndivision. ', u'\n', u' MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" ', u'\n', u'Gross margin increased slightly to\n32.9% of sales from 32.7% last year. This is a very positive sign and was a result of\nlower shrinkage and merchandise acquisition costs, as well as the ability of our\nlogistics department to reduce transportation costs despite significantly higher fuel\nprices and legislation that negatively impacted the long-haul trucking industry. These\nimprovements were partially offset by slightly higher promotional markdowns, as our\ncustomers purchased more products on sale. ', u'\n', u' MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" ', u'\n', u'Operating expenses increased to\n30.8% of sales from 30.4% last year. A significant factor in this increase was general\ninsurance costs, which rose $625,000 (0.6% of sales),  ', u'\n', u' MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Page Break CENTER" FSL="Workstation" ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u' *************************************************************************** ', u'\n', u' MARKER PAGE="sheet: 6; page: 6" ', u'\n', u' MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" ', u'\n', u'primarily due to an adjustment in\nthe company\x92s insurance reserves for workers compensation for the policy year ended\n5/31/04, as a result of revised actuarial estimates. We also experienced unusually high\nmedical insurance costs and credit card processing fees rose due to higher credit card\nusage by our customers. These expenses were partially offset by lower depreciation and\nstore remodeling costs, along with another solid performance from our distribution\ncenter. Additionally, we recorded a $275,000 reduction in expenses related to layaways,\nwhile there was no such adjustment in last year\x92s second quarter. ', u'\n', u' MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" ', u'\n', u'We take expense management very\nseriously, and we are proactive in managing expenses. For example, we have already taken\nsteps to reduce medical and workers compensation expenses and will closely monitor the\neffectiveness of such actions in coming quarters. ', u'\n', u' MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" ', u'\n', u'Interest expense declined to\n$279,000 for the second quarter, from $328,000 last year, primarily due to lower\nborrowings. ', u'\n', u' MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" ', u'\n', u'Earnings from continuing operations\nwere $1,234,000, or $0.28 cents per diluted share, compared with $1,341,000, or $0.31 per\ndiluted share last year. The decline relative to last year can be substantially explained\nby the largely non-recurring items discussed earlier. The increase in general insurance\nalone, which was primarily due to a non-recurring adjustment, cost us $0.09 cents a share\ncompared to last year. ', u'\n', u' MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" ', u'\n', u'Net earnings, including the results\nof discontinued operations, totaled $1,187,000, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared with\n$1,341,000, or $0.37 per diluted share last year. Discontinued operations last year\nbenefited from a gain on the sale of a store of approximately $259,000, or $0.04 per\ndiluted share. The balance of the shortfall, relative to last year\x92s net earnings, can be\nattributed to previously explained increases in operating expenses. ', u'\n', u' MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" ', u'\n', u'This is only the 2nd time in the\nlast 12 quarters where earnings have declined, and this is during a time when it is a\ndifficult and highly competitive environment for retailers.

', u'\n', u' MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" ', u'\n', u'Operating expenses as a percent of\nsales increased slightly to 31.3% this year from 31.2% last year, again primarily due to\nincreased general and medical insurance, partially offset by slightly reduced\ndistribution center expenses and lower store opening expenses.

As I pointed out earlier, this is only the 2nd quarter in the last 12\nwith a decline. Our diluted earnings per share have grown steadily from $1.00 in fiscal\nyear 2001, to $1.50 last year, a 50% increase during those 3 years. Also, the $1.50\ndiluted EPS last year is the highest it has been during the 7 years I have been here. Our\nstock price has responded to those solid results and our efforts to improve shareholder\nvalue, by more than tripling since then, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined.

This new\nretail concept provides a limited, but greatly          expanded, assortment of\nGroceries, and we believe it will build upon          our success in broadening the\nselection of consumables throughout our          retail store network. A second store was\nconverted into an \x93ALCO Market          Store\x94 during the first week of August.

Future expansion of the\n         \x93Market Store\x94 concept will depend upon the performance of these\n         initial three units.

At the          beginning of the\ninitial plan year our underwriter, Liberty Mutual,          along with actuaries retained\nby our insurance brokers, provided us          with what we considered a reasonable\nestimate for expense accruals.          After the plan year ended on May 31, 2004, which\nwas during our second          fiscal quarter, we were informed that previous reserves\nwere inadequate          due to escalating costs per claim. As a result, we had to\nincrease our          workers compensation reserves significantly in the most recent\nquarter.

We attribute this to the          actions we have taken to\nreduce our losses. Such actions include safety          training initiatives for our\nmanagers, management training seminars,          monthly safety videos and Loss\nPrevention Regional Inspection/Training          programs.

During          the past 2\nfiscal years, we have managed our medical expenses well and,          in fact, costs were\nbelow the estimates provided by our insurance          broker in each of those years.\nHowever, medical insurance expenses          began to spike upwards in the first half of\nthe current fiscal year. We          have responded to this situation by taking steps to\nincrease the          premiums paid by our associates and by implementing other changes\nthat          are designed to control future medical insurance costs.

I do          believe that high\ngasoline prices have affected consumer discretionary          spending. This coupled with\nunseasonably cool weather negatively          impacted sales of warm weather product\ncategories. While a greater          emphasis upon consumable products within our stores\nhas proven          successful, sales comparisons in more discretionary product\ncategories          were much more difficult in the second quarter.

I expect many\nof you have seen or heard about the letter I received from Raymond French of Strongbow\nCapital last week. It was dated August 19, 2004 and was attached as an exhibit to\namendment to a Schedule 13D filed by Strongbow Capital on that same date. I did not\nreceive the letter until after the conclusion of our regularly scheduled Board meeting on\nAugust 19th. ', u'\n', u' MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" ', u'\n', u'Mr. French put forth a number of\nsuggestions in his five page letter to me regarding the ways that he believes the\nperformance of the Company can be improved. Given our prior announcement regarding the\ntiming of this call, it is unfortunate that Mr. French did not provide us with an\nadequate amount of time to carefully consider and respond to his views during this call.\nWe nevertheless welcome the constructive views of all of our shareholders and recognize\nthat a nine percent owner like Strongbow clearly deserves a thoughtful response to its\ninput regarding the future direction of the Company. ', u'\n', u' MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 00" FSL="Workstation" ', u'\n', u'At this early stage, I can say that\nour fundamental views and goals are aligned with those of Strongbow Capital, at least to\nthe extent that we are strongly committed to improving our top and bottom line results,\noptimizing cost efficiencies, and implementing appropriate corporate governance\npractices. We are always open to new insights and perspectives on how to improve our\nstrategic positioning and operating effectiveness. In this regard, Mr. French\nacknowledged in his letter that he does not have all of the answers but encouraged us to\nretain a consultant to take a fresh look at these important matters. I can report today\nthat the capabilities of various business advisory firms for this purpose have been under\nevaluation since June of this year. At our Board meeting last Thursday, this search was\nnarrowed to a single candidate, and the Board authorized management to engage this\nleading business advisory firm once suitable terms of a working relationship are agreed\nupon. After we have engaged this business advisory firm, they will do a strategic and\noperational review of our company. After they have completed their analysis, they will\nwork with the Board and management to develop a revised business plan. The significant\nelements of our revised business plan will, of course, be communicated to all\nstockholders. Our Board, management and other advisors will also examine other means of\nenhancing stockholder value in the coming months.

We are proud\nof the fact that Duckwall-ALCO\x92s common stock has more than tripled in price since the\nbeginning of January 2001, compared with a 6% decline in the Dow Jones Industrial\nAverage. This has occurred in the midst of a difficult economy for retailers,\nparticularly in the small communities where our stores are located. Competitive pressures\nare a continuing challenge. However, we believe our business plan and operating\nphilosophy are sound and will benefit shareholder value further in the future.

Our current view is that this would be\nan inopportune near-term alternative that would prevent our shareholders from fully\nrealizing the long-term potential of their investment in Duckwall-ALCO Stores, Inc.\nHowever, we are fully aware of our fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and will\nconsider in good faith and with due care all credible proposals presented to us, so that\nwe may pursue with vigor such alternatives as are in the best interests of our\nstockholders. One of those alternatives, of course, foresees the continuation of\nDuckwall-ALCO Stores as an independent company under the direction of its current\nmanagement and Board of Directors.
