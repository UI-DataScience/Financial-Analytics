Cahill said,  "Despite a\nsoft retail environment in the U.S. during the third quarter, we were pleased to\nachieve volume growth,  while at the same time generating another quarter of net\nrevenue per case improvement."\n     PBG plans to  release  its  complete  third  quarter  results  on  Tuesday,\nSeptember 28, 2004.\n     The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc. is the world\'s largest manufacturer,  seller\nand  distributor of Pepsi-Cola  beverages with  operations in the U.S.,  Canada,\nGreece,  Mexico,  Russia, Spain and Turkey.
