', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'For fiscal 2004, the Company reported net income of $6.9 million, or\n$1.32 per basic share, $1.25 diluted, as compared to net income of $1.9 million, or $0.38 per share basic, $0.36 diluted for the year ended June 30, 2003. During the first and second quarters of fiscal 2004, the Company received $4.4 million in cash\npayments in connection with the Copa Casino in Gulfport, MS,, including a $4.0 million payment as final settlement of its December 1998 sale of its interest in the Copa. Management attributed the year-over-year improvement, excluding the one-time\nCopa gain, primarily to positive effects from its May, 2004 acquisition of Rail City Casino in Sparks, NV, from which two months of operations were included in fourth-quarter results. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The Company\x92s income from operations improved 14.3% year over year, from $4.3 million in fiscal 2003 to $4.9 million in fiscal 2004.\nNet revenues improved by 12%, from $55.7 million in fiscal 2003 to $62.3 million in fiscal 2004, reflecting contributions from Rail City. EBITDAR, which excludes one-time gains, increased 17.8% year over year, from $8.6 million in fiscal 2003 to\n$10.1 million in fiscal 2004. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company\nreported net income of $1.4 million, or $0.26 per basic share, $0.24 diluted, a significant improvement as compared to net income of $692,000 or $0.14 per basic share, $0.13 diluted, in the year-ago quarter. Factors contributing to the\nfourth-quarter improvements included two months of Rail City operations post-acquisition, higher occupancy at the Sands Regency in connection with the Men\x92s American Bowling Congress, and higher occupancy at the Gold Ranch RV Resort &\nCasino. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'For the fourth quarter ended June 2004, income from operations was $2.8 million on revenues of $20.5 million, as compared\nto income from operations of $1.6 million on revenues of $15.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Quarterly EBITDAR increased substantially year over year, from $2.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2003 to $4.6 million for the 2004\nquarter. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Ferenc B. Szony, President and CEO of The Sands Regent, commented,\n\x93Just two months of revenue contributions from Rail City validate our acquisition decision and suggest tremendous potential for that property going forward. We have nearly completed operational integration of Rail City into the Sands Regent\nfamily of properties and are very excited about the future of Rail City. This investment in the local Reno gaming market is paying off very well and adding to the strong performance of our other two properties.\x94 ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The Company\x92s growth strategy continues to include the possibility of additional\nacquisitions or other initiatives, especially involving expansion of operations in Northern Nevada.

Casino Partnership d/b/a the Copa Casino in Gulfport,\nMississippi (the \x93Copa\x94) regarding a final settlement of amounts owed to the Company pursuant to a non-interest bearing promissory note (the \x93Note\x94) issued to the Company in connection with its December 1998 sale of its interest\nin Copa. The terms of the Note required the Copa to make a monthly payment to the Company in an amount equal to the greater of $15,000 or 2% of the Copa\x92s gross gaming revenues (4% beginning July 2004) until paid in full. At the time of\nsettlement, the unpaid balance of the Note was $5.0 million. Pursuant to the settlement, the Company received a $4.0 million cash payment (the \x93Settlement Amount\x94) as final settlement under the Note. The Company had not previously\nrecognized a gain on the Settlement Amount due primarily to the Company\x92s uncertainty of the Copa\x92s ability to obtain long-term financing, as well as competitive, legal, financial, environmental and various other risks facing the Copa. As\na result, the Company has recognized a gain of the full Settlement Amount plus debt service payments made during the period.

Although this claim, subject to a contracted deductible, was insured, the insurance carrier became insolvent and is not expected to make any payment to the Company. The Company is currently seeking recovery of its loss from its former\ninsurance broker and believes that it has meritorious claims for relief. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'(3)', u'\n', u'EBITDAR includes earnings before depreciation, amortization, interest expense, income taxes, rent, asset impairment charges, and any gain or loss on the sale or disposal of property\nor subsidiaries. EBITDAR is not a calculation determined pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles and is not an alternative to operating income or net income, and is not a measure of liquidity. Since not all companies calculate this\nmeasure in the same manner, the Company\x92s EBITDAR measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that this disclosure enhances the understanding of the financial performance of a\ncompany with substantial interest expense, depreciation and amortization. Prior to the Gold Ranch acquisition, the Company reported \x93EBITDA\x94 data. Gold Ranch has a substantial real property rent component and the Company believes EBITDAR\nprovides a more complete depiction of the Company\x92s financial position and performance. Moreover, if the option of the Company to purchase the Gold Ranch real property is exercised, which can happen at the Company\x92s sole discretion, the\nrental expense would be available for other uses by the Company.
