The\ndecrease in revenues can be primarily attributed to a decline in AIT-\nand SDLT-based library revenue and the lack of 9-track tape drive\nrevenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, partially offset by\nhigher revenue from tape libraries incorporating LTO and SAIT tape\ndrives. Gross margin in the 2004 fourth quarter rose to 40.5 percent,\ncompared to 36.2 percent reported in the year-ago quarter. The\nincrease in gross margin was principally due to a favorable book to\nphysical inventory adjustment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.\n    Research and development costs for the fourth quarter of fiscal\n2004 were $977,000, or 12.7 percent of revenues, compared to $1.1\nmillion, or 13.3 percent of revenues, for the year-ago quarter. Sales\nand marketing expenses for the 2004 fiscal fourth quarter were\n$958,000, or 12.4 percent of revenues, compared to $1.0 million, or\n12.3 percent of revenues, in the same quarter last year. General and\nadministrative expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 were\n$937,000, or 12.2 percent of revenues, versus $1.3 million, or 16.5\npercent of revenues, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. In the\nfourth quarter of fiscal 2004, Qualstar did not incur any costs\nassociated with its previous patent infringement dispute with Raytheon\nCompany, resulting in a significant reduction in general and\nadministrative expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 compared\nto the year-ago period. The dispute with Raytheon was settled in April\n2004.\n    The Company recorded a tax provision of approximately $234,000 in\nthe fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, resulting in an effective tax\nbenefit rate of 16.6% for the full fiscal year 2004, compared to an\neffective tax rate of 33.3% for fiscal 2003. The low effective tax\nbenefit rate in fiscal 2004 can be primarily attributed to valuation\nallowances established for capital losses realized on a tax basis in\nfiscal 2004.\n    Qualstar reported income from operations of $242,000 for the\nfourth quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to a loss from operations of\n$486,000 for last year\'s fourth quarter. Further, the Company reported\na net loss of $16,000, or breakeven per diluted share, for the fourth\nquarter of fiscal 2004, compared with a net loss of $43,000, or\nbreakeven per diluted share, for last year\'s fourth quarter.\n    Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $35.8\nmillion at June 30, 2004, compared with $36.1 million at June 30,\n2003. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) were approximately 55 days at June\n30, 2004, compared to approximately 50 days at June 30, 2003.\nInventory turns were 2.5 times on an annualized basis for the period\nended June 30, 2004, compared to 2.9 times on an annualized basis for\nthe period ended June 30, 2003.\n\n    Full Year 2004 Results\n\n    Qualstar\'s fiscal 2004 revenues were $31.5 million, compared to\n$33.6 million for fiscal 2003. The Company reported a net loss of\n$731,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, in fiscal 2004, compared with\nnet income of $549,000, or $0.04 per diluted share, for fiscal 2003.\n    "Our fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations,"\nsaid Bill Gervais, president and chief executive officer of Qualstar\nCorporation. "With a highly regarded and feature-rich suite of storage\nsolutions already on the market, and a line of next-generation\nproducts currently under development, we are enhancing our sales and\nmarketing model to build out our customer base. We believe our recent\ndistribution agreement with Ingram Micro should help enhance our\npresence in the marketplace.\n    "We remain on track to announce our new XLS product family in late\ncalendar 2004, with customer shipments expected in the first half of\ncalendar 2005. By entering the high-end enterprise-class tape storage\nmarket with a product that meets stringent customer requirements at an\nattractive price point, we will gain access to a new, significant\nmarket opportunity," continued Mr. Gervais.\n    "As we continue our sales and development efforts, we\'re focused\non solidifying our position as the industry\'s recognized reliability\nleader. We believe this is the right strategy to help drive Qualstar\nto future long-term success."\n\n    Qualstar Corporation Conference Call\n\n    Company management will hold a conference call to discuss its\nfourth quarter fiscal year 2004 results today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific\n(5:00 p.m. Eastern).
