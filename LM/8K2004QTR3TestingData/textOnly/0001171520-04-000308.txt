A\nreconciliation of specific adjustments to GAAP results for the years ended July\n31, 2004 and 2003 is included in the financial tables shown above. A description\nof the Company\'s use of non-GAAP information is provided under "Non-GAAP\nResults" below.\n\nOn December 29, 2003, the Company assigned and transferred all of its\nobligations of its two "ineffective" interest rate swaps to a third party at a\ncost of $5.4 million plus accrued interest. As a result of this novation, these\n"ineffective" swaps will no longer be included as a special item for future\nfiscal periods. These "ineffective" swaps were included as a special item\nthrough the second quarter of fiscal 2004.\n\nThe Company entered into interest rate swap agreements in October 1998, August\n2001 and May 2003. The October 1998 and August 2001 agreements were\n"ineffective" hedges as a result of the options held by the counter parties that\nmay extend the original term of the interest rate swap agreements. Applicable\naccounting treatment requires that the Company record the changes in fair value\nof the October 1998 and August 2001 agreements in its consolidated statement of\nincome, rather than within "other comprehensive income" in its statement of\nstockholders\' equity. The changes in fair value are dependent upon the forward\nlooking yield curves for each swap. The May 2003 agreement is an "effective"\nhedge and therefore does not require this treatment. The Company believes that\nits October 1998 and August 2001 agreements are special items that are\nexcludable as non-recurring items. First, the Company only intends to enter into\n', u'\n\n"effective" hedges going forward. This stated intention began with the May 2003\nagreement. Second, the Company believes that the October 1998 and August 2001\nagreements may distort and confuse investors if the change in fair value cannot\nbe treated as a special item because their inclusion directly impacts its\nreported earnings per share. A change in fair value, whether positive or\nnegative, can significantly increase or decrease its reported earnings per\nshare. For example, the Company recorded a positive change in fair value for the\nsecond quarter of fiscal 2004 that increased its diluted earnings per share by\n$0.01, and in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the company recorded a negative\nchange in fair value that decreased its diluted earnings per share by $0.03. If\nthe Company were prohibited from excluding this item as a special item, it would\nartificially inflate its reported earnings per share and thereby mislead\ninvestors as to its results of operations and our financial condition.\n\nComments from Management\n\n"I am very pleased with our Company\'s performance in fiscal 2004," commented\nSteven Townsend, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "These results reflect\nthe success of our operating and marketing strategies which enabled us to\nexperience solid growth in our three primary distribution channels. We were also\nable to strengthen our financial position and solidify our balance sheet. At the\nsame time, we continued to strengthen our industry presence by entering new\nchannels of business and fostering several new and renewed business\nrelationships."\n\nMr. Townsend added, "As we look ahead, we are excited about our Company\'s\nprospects for fiscal 2005 and beyond. Our efforts remain focused on helping our\ncustomers be more successful in their marketplace while maintaining our position\nas America\'s premier certified organic distributor. To ensure that United\nNatural Foods is well positioned to capitalize on favorable growth opportunities\nin the natural and organic foods industry we will continue to invest in our\npeople, facilities, equipment and new technologies."\n\nThe Company reaffirms its guidance for fiscal 2005, ending July 31, 2005, with\nrevenues in the $1.9 to $2.0 billion range, and net income, excluding potential\nspecial items, in the range of $0.93 - $0.97 per diluted share. Special items\nmay include labor, moving and other costs related to the expansion of the\nCompany\'s distribution facilities. Historically, expenses related to the change\nin fair value of interest rate swaps, distribution facility expansions and asset\nimpairment charges (including goodwill) have been classified as special items.\nHowever, at this time the Company does not know the extent or significance of\nthese items or whether the Company will in fact incur any of these or other\nspecial items in fiscal 2005. The Company\'s guidance is based on a number of\nassumptions, which are subject to change and many of which are outside the\ncontrol of the Company. If any of these assumptions vary, the Company\'s guidance\nmay change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these\nresults.

Any projections of future results of operations should not be construed in\nany manner as a guarantee that such results will in fact occur. These\nprojections are subject to change and could differ materially from final\nreported results. The Company may from time to time update these publicly\nannounced projections, but it is not obligated to do so.\n\nNon-GAAP Results: To supplement its financial statements presented on a GAAP\nbasis, the Company uses non-GAAP additional measures of operating results, net\nearnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude special charges. The Company\nbelieves that the use of these additional measures is appropriate to enhance an\noverall understanding of its past financial performance and also its prospects\nfor the future as these special charges are not expected to be part of the\nCompany\'s ongoing business. The adjustments to the Company\'s GAAP results are\nmade with the intent of providing both management and investors with a more\ncomplete understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and its\nmarketplace performance. For example, these adjusted non-GAAP results are among\nthe primary indicators management uses as a basis for its planning and\nforecasting of future periods. The presentation of this additional information\nis not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings\nor diluted earnings per share prepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States of America. A comparison and\nreconciliation from non-GAAP to GAAP results is included in the tables within\nthis release.\n', u'\n\n                   UNITED NATURAL FOODS, INC.
