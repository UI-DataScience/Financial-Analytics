"Despite the new accounting treatment\nduring fiscal 2004, we started a number of new programs, and made improvements\n\n                                     -more-\n\nPage 1 of 7\n', u'\n\nWarrantech Corporation                                             Sept. 2, 2004\nFirst Quarter 2005 Financial Results\n\n\nto Warrantech\'s management team. Hard work pays off in positive performance.\nAlthough weakness continued in the automotive segment, gross revenues are up in\nboth the international and consumer product services divisions. In spite of a\nweak economy and complex accounting rule changes that obscure the success of our\nachievements, I\'m proud of what Warrantech and our management team has\naccomplished."\n\nGross Revenues\n- --------------\n\n         Gross revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 ended June 30,\n2004, were $33.0 million, down 16 percent compared to $39.2 million in the first\nquarter fiscal 2004. Gross revenues in the international division rose 11\npercent during the first quarter 2005 to $2.1 million, up $0.2 million from $1.9\nmillion in the comparable 2004 quarter. Consumer products services reported\ngross revenues of $9.4 million during the first quarter fiscal 2005, up 3\npercent or $0.3 million in the same period the previous year. The automotive\ndivision had gross revenues of $21.8 million during the first quarter fiscal\n2005, down $6.5 million or 23 percent from $28.3 million in the same quarter in\nfiscal 2004.\n\nDirect Costs\n- ------------\n\n         Direct costs are primarily insurance premiums and commission expenses\nrelated to the production and acquisition of service contracts. For the first\nquarter fiscal 2005, direct costs were $17.4 million, down $5.7 million or 25\npercent, from $23.1 million in the same quarter in fiscal 2004. Automotive\ndirect costs decreased $5.8 million or 32 percent, consumer products direct\ncosts decreased $0.5 million or 9 percent, while international direct costs\nincreased $0.1 million or 11 percent during the first quarter fiscal 2005\ncompared to the same period in fiscal 2004.\n\n                                     -more-\n\nPage 2 of 7\n', u"\n\nWarrantech Corporation                                             Sept. 2, 2004\nFirst Quarter 2005 Financial Results\n\n\nGross Profit\n- ------------\n\n         Gross profit for the first quarter 2005 decreased $0.8 million or 11\npercent compared to the same period in fiscal 2004.

Legal\nexpenses increased $0.3 million during the first quarter 2005 due to litigation\nexpenses related to the Lloyd's Underwriter's lawsuit and legal advice in\nconnection with seeking guidance from the staff of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission. Employee costs were lower at $4.3 million during the first quarter\nfiscal 2005 compared to $4.5 million in the same period the previous year due\nprimarily to efficiencies in total head count. Rent expense decreased by $0.2\nmillion from $0.6 million in the first quarter fiscal 2004 compared to $0.4\nmillion in the same period in fiscal 2005 due to the company's move to the new\ncorporate headquarters in Bedford, Tx. Depreciation decreased from $0.9 million\nin the first quarter of 2004 to $0.7 million in the same period in 2005 due to\nthe company's planned obsolescence and reduced requirement for capital\nexpenditures on call center equipment.\n\n                                     -more-\n\nPage 3 of 7\n", u'\n\nWarrantech Corporation                                             Sept. 2, 2004\nFirst Quarter 2005 Financial Results\n\n\nIncome from Operations\n- ----------------------\n\n         For the first quarter fiscal 2005, Warrantech had a loss from\noperations of $1.4 million compared to an operating loss of $1.1 million in the\nsame period last year.

Should one or more of these or\nany other risks or uncertainties materialize or develop in a manner adverse to\nthe company, or should the company\'s underlying assumptions prove incorrect,\nactual results of operations, cash flows or the company\'s financial condition\nmay vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or expected and there\ncould be a materially adverse effect on the company\'s business.\n\n                                      # # #\n\n                                     -more-\n\nPage 4 of 7\n', u'\n\nWarrantech Corporation                                             Sept. 2, 2004\nFirst Quarter 2005 Financial Results\n\n\n\n                     WARRANTECH CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                 CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n                                   (Unaudited)\n\n', u'\n', u'\n                                                      For the Three Months Ended\n                                                               June 30,\n                                                     ----------------------------\n                                                         2004            2003\n                                                     ------------    ------------\n', u' ', u' ', u'\nGross revenues                                       $ 32,994,936    $ 39,170,157\n     Revenues deferred to future periods              (31,042,699)     (9,620,586)\n     Deferred revenues earned                          21,909,254         844,251\nNet (increase) decrease in deferred revenues           (9,133,445)     (8,776,335)\n                                                     ------------    ------------\nNet revenues                                           23,861,491      30,393,822\n\nDirect costs                                           17,400,074      23,098,528\n                                                     ------------    ------------\nGross Profit                                         $  6,461,417    $  7,295,294\n\nOperating expenses\n  Service, selling, and general and administrative      6,965,207       7,350,767\n  Provision for bad debt expense                          131,279          95,000\n  Depreciation and amortization                           728,489         928,080\n                                                     ------------    ------------\nTotal costs and expenses                                7,824,975       8,373,847\n                                                     ------------    ------------\n\nIncome (loss) from operations                          (1,363,558)     (1,078,553)\nOther income                                              178,641         204,321\n                                                     ------------    ------------\n\nIncome (loss) before provision for income taxes        (1,184,917)       (874,232)\nProvision for income taxes                               (425,378)       (399,240)\n                                                     ------------    ------------\n\nNet income (loss)                                    ($   759,539)   ($   474,992)\n                                                     ============    ============\n\nEarnings (loss) per share:\n    Basic                                            ($      0.05)   ($      0.03)\n                                                     ============    ============\n    Diluted                                          ($      0.05)   ($      0.03)\n                                                     ============    ============\n\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding:\n    Basic                                              15,398,677      15,344,563\n                                                     ============    ============\n    Diluted                                            15,398,677      15,344,563\n                                                     ============    ============\n', u'\n\n                                     -more-\n\nPage 5 of 7\n', u'\n\nWarrantech Corporation                                             Sept. 2, 2004\nFirst Quarter 2005 Financial Results\n\n\n\n                     WARRANTECH CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n                      CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n\n\n                                                     (Unaudited)\n                                                       June 30,       March 31,\n                                                         2004           2004\n                                                     ------------   ------------\nA S S E T S\n- -----------\n\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents                            $  6,093,021   $  5,229,773\nInvestments in marketable securities                    1,086,622      1,370,731\nAccounts receivable, (net of allowances of\n   $328,065 and $233,667, respectively)                23,123,347     23,369,612\nOther receivables -
