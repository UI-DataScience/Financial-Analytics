In addition,  volume\npurchasing helped to increase gross profits.\n\n"Net  income for the second  quarter and the first half of fiscal year 2005 were\nprimarily  affected  by the decline in other  non-operating  income of 43.9% and\n43.8%, respectively."\n\nCertain  statements  contained  herein with respect to factors  which may affect\nfuture  earnings,  including  management\'s  beliefs  and  assumptions  based  on\ninformation currently available, are forward-looking statements made pursuant to\nthe safe harbor  provisions of the Private  Securities  Litigation Reform Act of\n1995.
