The\nCompany realized revenue of $63.1 million and net income of $3.8 million for the\nfourth  quarter of the 2004 fiscal year compared to revenue of $55.5 million and\nnet income of $577,000 for the same period in the prior year.\n\n     Commenting on the results,  Jeff Weiss,  the  Company\'s  Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer said, "We are very pleased with our financial results as these\nresults evidence our ability to continue to focus on the core business  strategy\nof providing the right  product mix to our  customers as well as a  high-quality\nservice.  We also  continue to see  moderate  improvement  in the U.S.  economy,\nparticularly  in lower-wage  service  sector jobs,  which  directly  impacts our\ncustomer base. In addition,  due to our continued focus on collection  practices\nand  underwriting  standards,  all of our key  credit  ratios  are in line  with\nexpectations.  Our new product  efforts are bearing  fruit,  most notably in the\nareas of debit card and installment loans. Specifically, during the June quarter\nwe  signed an  agreement  with  Visa  U.S.A.,  Inc.  and West  Suburban  Bank to\nexclusively  market Visa(R) branded prepaid card products in the U.S. and we are\nin the process of  rolling-out  this  program to all of our 319 U.S.  locations.\nFiscal 2004 was an outstanding year for our Company made possible, as always, by\nthe hard work and  dedication  of our more than 3,300  employees  worldwide.  My\nthanks go to all of them for a job very well done."\n\n     Don  Gayhardt,  the  Company\'s  President  commented,  "In  addition to the\nimproving U.S.  operations,  we continue to realize strong  performance from our\ninternational (Canada and the United Kingdom) operations as indicated by a 25.4%\nincrease  in total  foreign  revenue to $136.6  million for the 2004 fiscal year\nfrom $108.9 million for the prior year period. We increased our company-operated\nand franchised  locations by 28 units in Canada and the United Kingdom,  as well\nas executed our first U.S.  market  franchise  development  agreement  for three\nfranchise stores. We also continue to benefit from higher international earnings\nas the dollar remains weak in relation to the Canadian and U.K. currencies."\n\n                                       1\n', u"\nFiscal Year Results\n\n     Total  revenues,  which were led  primarily  by strong  check  cashing  and\nconsumer loan revenues, increased 12.3 % for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004\nto $246.4  million  from $219.4  million  for the same  period last year.

prepared in accordance  with GAAP.  Adjusted\nEBITDA is earnings before interest expense, income tax provision,  depreciation,\namortization and other items described below. Dollar presents Adjusted EBITDA as\nan indication of operating  performance  and its ability to service its debt and\ncapital  expenditure  requirements.  Adjusted  EBITDA does not indicate  whether\nDollar's cash flow will be  sufficient  to fund all of its cash needs.  Adjusted\nEBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute  for net income,\ncash flows from operating activities or other measures of operating  performance\nor liquidity  determined in  accordance  with GAAP.  Dollar  believes that these\namounts should be reviewed by prospective  investors because Dollar uses them as\none means of analyzing  its ability to service its debt and capital  expenditure\nrequirements, and Dollar understands that they are used by some investors as one\nmeasure  of a  Company's  historical  ability to  service  its debt and  capital\nexpenditure  requirements.  Not  all  companies  calculate  EBITDA  in the  same\nfashion, and therefore these amounts as presented may not be comparable to other\nsimilarly  titled  measures of other  companies.
