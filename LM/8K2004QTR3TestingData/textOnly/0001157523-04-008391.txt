(NYSE:FCEA)(NYSE:FCEB) today announced increases in\nnet earnings, revenues and EBDT for the second quarter and six months\nended July 31, 2004.\n    Net earnings for the 2004 second quarter were $34.8 million, or\n$0.68 per share, compared with $6.6 million, or $0.13 per share, in\n2003. A primary reason for the increase was Forest City\'s disposition\nof two regional shopping malls and a specialty retail center (all\naccounted for under the equity method) during the second quarter of\nfiscal 2004 - which resulted in a total after-tax gain of\napproximately $19.3 million. In addition, last year\'s second-quarter\nnet earnings were impacted by a one-time expense of $6.9 million\n(after-tax) related to the Company\'s public offering of senior notes,\nwhich did not recur this year.\n    Net earnings for the six months ended July 31, 2004 were $42\nmillion, or $0.83 per share, compared with $21.4 million, or $0.42 per\nshare, in 2003. The year-to-year comparison of net earnings for the\nsix months was impacted by the transactions described above, as well\nas Forest City\'s first-quarter 2004 disposition of a residential\ncommunity that resulted in an $11.8 million after-tax gain.\nFurthermore, during the fiscal 2004 first quarter, the Company adopted\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (as\nrevised) ("FIN 46 (R)"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest\nEntities." FIN 46 (R) resulted in the cumulative effect of a change in\naccounting principle charge to earnings, net of tax, of $11.3 million.\n    Second-quarter consolidated revenues increased 33 percent to\n$305.9 million compared with $230.1 million in the prior year\'s second\nquarter. Consolidated revenues for the six months ended July 31, 2004\nincreased 29.4 percent to $588.8 million compared with $455 million\nfor the six months ended July 31, 2003.\n    EBDT (Earnings Before Depreciation, Amortization and Deferred\nTaxes) for the second quarter was $71 million, or $1.40 per share, a\n41.4 percent increase on a per share basis over last year\'s\nsecond-quarter EBDT of $50.3 million, or $0.99 per share. EBDT for the\nsix months ended July 31, 2004 was $126.1 million, or $2.48 per share,\na 22.8 percent increase on a per share basis compared with last year\'s\n$101.7 million, or $2.02 per share.\n    The increases in revenues and EBDT for the second quarter and\nfirst half of 2004 were primarily due to the 13 project openings and\nacquisitions completed in fiscal 2003, and the six project openings\nthus far in fiscal 2004.\n    EBDT and EBDT per share are non-Generally Accepted Accounting\nPrinciples (GAAP) measures provided as a supplement to net earnings\nand net earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP. The\nCompany believes that EBDT provides additional information about its\ncore business operations and is necessary to understand its ongoing\nfinancial position. A reconciliation of net earnings (the most\ndirectly comparable GAAP measure to EBDT) to EBDT is provided in the\nFinancial Highlights table in this news release. A more complete\ndiscussion of EBDT is included in this news release.\n    Please refer to the Company\'s website at www.forestcity.net for a\nSupplemental Package furnished to the Securities and Exchange\nCommission on Form 8-K. This Supplemental Package includes operating\nand financial information for the three and six months ended July 31,\n2004, with reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their\nmost directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\n    Discussion of Results\n\n    A key driver of Forest City\'s EBDT is Net Operating Income (NOI),\na non-GAAP financial measure. Total Real Estate Groups NOI for the\nsecond quarter grew largely due to the openings and acquisitions\ncompleted last year and thus far this year.\n    Comparable property NOI - NOI from properties operated during the\nsecond quarters of both 2004 and 2003 - was up 2.9 percent in 2004\ncompared with the prior year. This is the third consecutive quarter of\ncomparable NOI growth, compared with decreases in the two previous\nfiscal years (2003 and 2002).\n    The retail portfolio\'s comparable NOI for the second quarter was\nup 2.7 percent, as retail continues to be a strong-performing property\ntype for the Company, while comparable NOI for the office portfolio\nwas up 3.6 percent. The residential portfolio was down 4.7 percent\nbecause of ongoing pressure on apartment rentals caused by limited job\ngrowth and favorable interest rates for homebuyers.\n    Comparable property NOI (mentioned above), a non-GAAP financial\nmeasure, is based on the pro-rata consolidation method - see Exhibit\nto this news release, which also presents comparable property NOI on\nthe full consolidation method.\n    Charles A. Ratner, president and chief executive officer of Forest\nCity Enterprises, said, "We are pleased with our second-quarter and\nfirst-half results. Our increase in EBDT was primarily driven by our\nproject openings and acquisitions completed in fiscal 2003 and thus\nfar in fiscal 2004. We completed six project openings during the first\nhalf of fiscal 2004 totaling $290.7 million of cost at our share\n($330.6 million on a full consolidation basis). We have a very robust\ndevelopment pipeline, which includes 18 projects under construction,\ntotaling $1.2 billion of cost at our share ($923 million of cost on a\nfull consolidation basis). At the close of the fiscal first half of\n2004, the core markets accounted for 97 percent of our total project\nopenings and 75 percent of our total projects under construction --\nbased on total property cost."\n    Ratner said, "Another aspect of our Core Market Strategy includes\ncontinually evaluating our current portfolio to determine the optimal\ntiming of property disposal to better employ capital in a\ntax-efficient manner. Such dispositions enable us to recycle\ninvestment capital into additional high-impact projects. Thus far, in\n2004, we have disposed of four properties. During the second quarter,\nwe disposed of Manhattan Town Center Mall in Manhattan, Kansas, and\nChapel Hill Mall and an adjacent shopping center in Akron, Ohio,\nresulting in a total after-tax gain of approximately $19.3 million\n(accounted for under the equity method). During the first quarter, we\ndisposed of Woodlake, a residential community in Silver Spring,\nMaryland, for an $11.8 million after-tax gain. In fiscal 2004, we have\ndisposed of, or have proposed the disposal of, projects with total\nsales proceeds of approximately $280 million, including properties\naccounted for on the equity method."\n\n    Portfolio and Development Pipeline Highlights\n\n    A schedule of the Company\'s project openings and pipeline of\nprojects under construction is included in this news release.\nHighlighted below are several of the Company\'s project openings and\nprojects under construction or development.\n\n    Second-Quarter Project Openings\n\n    Of the nine projects expected to open in fiscal 2004, six were\nopened in the first half - four of which opened in the second quarter.\nThe largest of these project openings were the retail and office\ncomponents of Atlantic Terminal in New York City. The four-story,\n373,000-square-foot retail center opened 87 percent leased and is\nBrooklyn\'s first new indoor mall in more than three decades. The\nretail component is anchored by a Super Target store that occupies\nthree floors. Target\'s grand opening produced record opening-day sales\nand the store continues to experience very heavy traffic. The retail\ncenter is located below the new 10-story, 399,000-square-foot office\nbuilding, in which 1,500 Bank of New York employees are among the\nfirst office tenants.\n\n    Three Openings Scheduled for Second Half of Fiscal 2004\n\n    The 1.0-million-square-foot, open-air Victoria Gardens will\ninclude a mixture of nationally and locally known stores, restaurants\nand cafes, as well as offices, housing, and civic and cultural venues.\nThe total project cost is expected to be $148.3 million at the\nCompany\'s share, and $185.4 million on a full consolidation basis.\nJCPenney, Macy\'s, Robinsons-May and AMC Theaters will be the anchor\ntenants at Victoria Gardens, which will also feature more than 100\nspecialty retailers. The development will serve as a new downtown for\nRancho Cucamonga in Southern California. The development was 80\npercent pre-leased at July 31, 2004, and the Company expects to open\nthe project more than 90 percent committed.\n    Quartermaster Plaza in South Philadelphia will feature anchor\nstores Home Depot and BJ\'s Wholesale Club, with additional stores such\nas Staples, AJ Wright, PETsMart and Walgreens, among other national\nretailers and local merchants. The project is currently 87 percent\npre-leased and is expected to cost $69.7 million. The site is part of\nthe former Quartermaster Depot military facility that distributed Army\nsupplies from World War I through the Gulf War.\n    Also in Philadelphia, construction is continuing on a life\nsciences research facility at the University of Pennsylvania. The\nCompany\'s Boston-based University Bioscience & Technology Group is\nacting as developer for the $56.6 million, 123,000-square-foot\nfacility. Forest City has an option to purchase this project prior to\nor upon completion.\n\n    Projects Under Construction\n\n    In addition to the above-mentioned projects, 15 projects totaling\n$929.7 million of cost at the Company\'s share ($611.5 million on a\nfull consolidation basis) are under construction -- four retail\nprojects, two office buildings and nine residential communities. The\nmost recent construction starts are described below.\n    Forest City broke ground on the 1.5-million-square-foot, 52-story\nNew York Times Headquarters office building in the first quarter.\nDuring the fiscal second quarter, the Company announced closing on\n$320 million in construction financing for this new building in New\nYork City\'s Times Square. The financing, the single-largest project\nloan in Forest City\'s history, is being provided by GMAC Commercial\nMortgage. Construction is expected to be completed in 2007.\n    In Southern California, Forest City recently broke ground on Simi\nValley Town Center, a 600,000-square-foot regional lifestyle center\nthat will include anchor tenants Macy\'s and Robinsons-May, and as many\nas 120 specialty shops and restaurants. Scheduled to open in fiscal\n2005, the town center is already 56 percent pre-leased.\n    In Chicago, Forest City has begun construction on 502 high-rise\napartments at its mixed-use Central Station land development project.\nThe apartment community is scheduled to open in 2006.\n    Forest City also continues to expand its supported-living\nportfolio, which is concentrated in the New York City metropolitan\narea. The Company currently has 13 such properties in its portfolio,\nand Sterling Glen of Lynbrook and Sterling Glen of Roslyn are under\nconstruction. When completed in fiscal 2005 and 2006, respectively,\nthey will add more than 250 units to the Company\'s supported-living\nportfolio.\n    During the 2004 second quarter, Forest City reached significant\nmilestones in its redevelopment of military family housing for the\nU.S. Navy in Hawaii. In May, the Company announced the signing of a\n50-year Partnership Agreement between its affiliate (Hawaii Military\nCommunities, LLC) and the Navy for the Ohana Military Communities\ndevelopment. Phase One of the partnership with the Navy involves the\nconstruction of 910 new homes and the renovation of 1,040 existing\nmilitary family homes over the next four years, and the ongoing\noperation and maintenance of the properties and residential\ncommunities for the next 50 years. In June, Hawaii Military\nCommunities assumed responsibility for day-to-day ownership,\ndevelopment and management of five U.S. Navy communities; and in July,\nbroke ground on initial redevelopment.\n\n    Denver -- Stapleton Update\n\n    Three years since groundbreaking, Forest City\'s Stapleton\nmixed-use redevelopment in Denver continues to grow and attract\nadditional residents and retail tenants. The demand for single-family\nlots remains strong. During the second quarter, there were 143 new\nsingle-family homes sold and another 131 homes became occupied. By the\nend of the second quarter, there were a total of 1,421 homes sold,\n1,051 occupied, and 335 under construction. There are more than 2,500\npeople living at Stapleton today.\n    Retail openings at Stapleton\'s East 29th Avenue Town Center during\nthe second quarter included Walgreens and Cold Stone Creamery. In\naddition, new tenants have moved into Crescent Flats residential units\nabove the retail shops at the town center, and the first phase of town\nhomes and live/work lofts at Botanica on the Green began leasing\nduring the second quarter. Crescent Flats is currently 98 percent\nleased.\n\n    Projects Under Development\n\n    Forest City has more than 20 projects under development -\nincluding several of the largest and most prestigious projects in\nCompany history. These projects, currently in the initial stages of\ndevelopment, are expected to promote the Company\'s future growth and\nopen between 2005 and 2008.\n    Among the projects under development is Waterfront in Washington,\nD.C. In May, Forest City received a letter of intent from Fannie Mae\nto lease up to 1.5 million square feet of office space at this\nproject. The site of the former Waterside Mall is being redeveloped by\nForest City and its partners to include 2.1 million square feet of\noffice space, approximately 400 residential units, and 75,000 square\nfeet of stores and restaurants.\n    In August, Forest City reached a significant milestone in its\nplanned mixed-use development of Brooklyn Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn,\nwhen its New York City affiliate, Forest City Ratner Companies, closed\non the purchase of a minority interest in the Nets NBA basketball\nteam. The project is expected to include a new 850,000-square-foot\nsports and entertainment arena for the Nets that will serve as a\ncatalyst for the development of surrounding real estate.\n    Other large commercial projects under development include three\nopen-air, lifestyle retail centers: Northfield at Stapleton in Denver;\nRidge Hill Village Center in Yonkers, New York; and Bolingbrook in\nChicago; as well as the 42-acre, mixed-use Southeast Federal Center\nproject in Washington, D.C.\n\n    Financing Summary\n\n    Forest City continues to take advantage of current interest rates\nand attractive debt markets for its project financings, with primary\nemphasis on locking in fixed-rate nonrecourse mortgages. During the\nfirst six months of 2004, Forest City closed on transactions totaling\n$355.6 million in nonrecourse mortgage financings, including $189.3\nmillion for new development projects, $93.9 million in refinancings,\nand $72.5 million in loan extensions.\n    At July 31, 2004, the Company\'s weighted average cost of mortgage\ndebt decreased to 5.57 percent from 5.95 percent at July 31, 2003,\nprimarily due to the general decrease in the fixed-rate portfolio.\nFixed-rate mortgage debt, which represented 64 percent of the\nCompany\'s total nonrecourse mortgage debt, decreased from 6.98 percent\nat July 31, 2003 to 6.82 percent at July 31, 2004. Variable-rate\nmortgage debt decreased from 3.51 percent at July 31, 2003 to 3.48\npercent at July 31, 2004.\n\n    Outlook\n\n    Ratner said, "Our current growth is a direct result of our ability\nto manage the portfolio strategically, enabling us to maximize the\nvalue of our current projects and providing us with the resources to\npursue additional large complex projects. We plan to open projects\ntotaling $565.3 million of cost at our share ($642.3 million on the\nfull consolidation basis) in 2004, and we expect them to have a\nsignificant and lasting positive effect on our business. Going\nforward, we have a wide variety of high-impact projects in our\ndevelopment pipeline that are due to be completed between fiscal 2005\nand 2008.\n    "We are confident that our strong first-half performance, combined\nwith the strategic dispositions we have completed, provides us with\nthe momentum to have a very successful year in fiscal 2004," Ratner\nsaid. "At this time, we expect our EBDT per share to be in the range\nof $4.55 to $4.60. We are on track for 2004 to be our 25th consecutive\nyear of EBDT growth."\n\n    Corporate Description\n\n    Forest City Enterprises, Inc. is a $7.2 billion NYSE-listed real\nestate company headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. The Company is\nprincipally engaged in the ownership, development, acquisition and\nmanagement of commercial and residential real estate throughout the\nUnited States. The Company\'s portfolio includes interests in retail\ncenters, apartment communities, office buildings and hotels in 20\nstates and the District of Columbia.\n\n    EBDT\n\n    The Company uses an additional measure, along with net earnings,\nto report its operating results. This measure, referred to as Earnings\nBefore Depreciation, Amortization and Deferred Taxes ("EBDT"), is not\na measure of operating results or cash flows from operations as\ndefined by GAAP and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures reported by other companies.\n    The Company believes that EBDT provides additional information\nabout its core operations and, along with net earnings, is necessary\nto understand its operating results. EBDT is used by the chief\noperating decision maker and management in assessing operating\nperformance and to consider capital requirements and allocation of\nresources by segment and on a consolidated basis. The Company believes\nEBDT is important to investors because it provides another method for\nthe investor to measure the Company\'s long-term operating performance,\nas net earnings can vary from year to year due to property\ndispositions, acquisitions and other factors that have a short-term\nimpact.\n    EBDT is defined as net earnings excluding the following items: i)\ngain (loss) on disposition of operating properties, divisions and\nother investments (net of tax); ii) the adjustment to recognize rental\nrevenues and rental expense using the straight-line method; iii)\nnon-cash charges from Forest City Rental Properties Corporation, a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of Forest City Enterprises, Inc., for\ndepreciation, amortization (including amortization of mortgage\nprocurement costs) and deferred income taxes; iv) provision for\ndecline in real estate (net of tax); v) extraordinary items (net of\ntax); and vi) cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (net\nof tax).\n    EBDT is reconciled to net earnings, the most comparable financial\nmeasure calculated in accordance with GAAP in the Company\'s\nSupplemental Package furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K. The adjustment\nto recognize rental revenues and rental expenses on the straight-line\nmethod is excluded because it is management\'s opinion that rental\nrevenues and expenses should be recognized when due from the tenants\nor due to the landlord. The Company excludes depreciation and\namortization expense related to real estate operations from EBDT\nbecause it believes the values of its properties, in general, have\nappreciated over time in excess of their original cost. Deferred taxes\nfrom real estate operations, which are the result of timing\ndifferences of certain net expense items deducted in a future year for\nfederal income tax purposes, are excluded until the year in which they\nare reflected in our current tax provision. The provision for decline\nin real estate is excluded from EBDT because it varies from year to\nyear based on factors unrelated to our overall financial performance\nand is related to the ultimate gain on dispositions of operating\nproperties. Our EBDT may not be directly comparable to\nsimilarly-titled measures reported by other companies.\n\n    Pro-Rata Consolidation Method\n\n    This press release contains certain financial measures prepared in\naccordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP")\nunder the full consolidation accounting method, and certain financial\nmeasures prepared in accordance with the pro-rata consolidation method\n(non-GAAP). The Company presents certain financial amounts under the\npro-rata method because it believes this information is useful to\ninvestors as this method more accurately reflects the manner in which\nthe Company operates its business. This is because, in line with\nindustry practice, the Company has made a large number of investments\nin which its economic ownership is less than 100% as a means of\nprocuring opportunities and sharing risk. Under the pro-rata\nconsolidation method, the Company presents its investments\nproportionate to its share of ownership. Under GAAP, the full\nconsolidation method is used to report partnership assets and\nliabilities as consolidated at 100% if deemed to be under its control\nor if the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary for its\ninvestments in the variable interest entities ("VIE"), even if its\nownership is not 100%. The Company provides reconciliations from the\nfull consolidation method to the pro-rata consolidation method\nthroughout its Supplemental Package furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K.\n\n    Safe Harbor Language\n\n    Statements made in this news release that state the Company or\nmanagement\'s intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions\nof the future are forward-looking statements.

This measure, referred to as\n    Earnings Before Depreciation, Amortization and Deferred Taxes\n    ("EBDT"), is not a measure of operating results as defined by\n    generally accepted accounting principles and may not be directly\n    comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other\n    companies. The Company believes that EBDT provides additional\n    information about its operations, and along with net earnings, is\n    necessary to understand its operating results. EBDT is defined as\n    net earnings excluding the following items: i) gain (loss) on\n    disposition of operating properties, division and other\n    investments (net of tax); ii) the adjustment to recognize rental\n    revenues and rental expense using the straight-line method; iii)\n    noncash charges from Forest City Rental Properties Corporation, a\n    wholly-owned subsidiary of Forest City Enterprises, Inc., for\n    depreciation, amortization (including amortization of mortgage\n    procurement costs) and deferred income taxes; iv) provision for\n    decline in real estate (net of tax); v) extraordinary items (net\n    of tax); and vi) cumulative effect of change in accounting\n    principle (net of tax). See our discussion of EBDT in the news\n    release.\n\n3) Amount represents depreciation expense for certain properties\n    accounted for on the equity method of accounting under both full\n    consolidation and pro-rata consolidation (a non-GAAP financial\n    measure). See our discussion of pro-rata consolidation in the news\n    release.\n\n4) The Company recognizes minimum rents on a straight-line basis over\n    the term of the related lease pursuant to the provision of SFAS\n    No. 13, "Accounting for Leases." The straight-line rent adjustment\n    is recorded as an increase or decrease to revenue from Forest City\n    Rental Properties Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Forest\n    City Enterprises, Inc., with the applicable offset to either\n    accounts receivable or accounts payable, as appropriate.\n\n5) The following table provides detail of Depreciation and\n    Amortization. The Company\'s Real Estate Groups are owned by Forest\n    City Rental Properties Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary\n    engaged in the ownership, development, acquisition and management\n    of

Under full consolidation, costs are\n    reported as consolidated at 100% if we are deemed to have control\n    or to be the primary beneficiary of our investments in the\n    variable interest entity ("VIE").\n(b) Cost at Pro-Rata Share represents Forest City\'s share of cost,\n    based on its pro-rata ownership of each property (a Non-GAAP\n    measure). Under the pro-rata consolidation method of accounting\n    the company determines its pro-rata share by multiplying its\n    pro-rata ownership by the total cost of the applicable property.\n(c) Reported under the equity method of accounting. This method\n    represents a GAAP presentation for investments in which the\n    Company is not deemed to have control or to be the primary\n    beneficiary of our investments in a VIE.\n(d) The difference between the full consolidation amount (GAAP) of\n    $330.6 million of cost to the Company\'s pro-rata share (a non-GAAP\n    measure) of $290.7 million of cost consists of a reduction to full\n    consolidation for minority interest of $39.9 million of cost and\n    the addition of its share of cost for unconsolidated investments\n    of $0.0 million.\n(e) Phased-in openings. Costs are representative of the total project.\n(f) The difference between the full consolidation amount (GAAP) of\n    $0.0 million of cost to the Company\'s pro-rata share (a non-GAAP\n    measure) of $44.3 million of cost consists of its share of cost\n    for unconsolidated investments of $44.3 million.\n(g) Represents the Company\'s portion of this 1.1 million square-foot\n    office condominium.\n(h) Project also includes 141,000 total square feet (57,000 sq ft\n    owned/managed by Forest City) of retail and 34,000 square feet of\n    office space.\n(i) Supported-living property.\n(j) The difference between the full consolidation amount (GAAP) of\n    $923.2 million of cost to the Company\'s pro-rata share (a non-GAAP\n    measure) of $1,204.3 million of cost consists of a reduction to\n    full consolidation for minority interest of $91.5 million of cost\n    and the addition of its share of cost for unconsolidated\n    investments of $372.6 million.\n(k) Includes 45,000 square feet of office space.\n(l) Includes 235,000 square feet of office space.\n(m) The Company will have an option to acquire this property.\n(n) This project will also include the acquisition of an adjacent\n    retail center totaling 508,000 square feet.\n(o) Formerly Stone Gate at Bellefair.\n(p) Formerly Tanglewood Crest.\n(q) Formerly Bryant Landing.\n(r) The difference between the full consolidation amount (GAAP) of\n    $0.0 million of cost to Forest City\'s pro-rata share (a non-GAAP\n    measure) of $27.5 million of cost consists of its share of cost\n    for unconsolidated investments of $27.5 million.\n(s) As is customary within the real estate industry, the Company\n    invests in certain real estate projects through joint ventures.\n    For these projects, the Company provides funding for certain of\n    its partners\' equity contributions. The Company consolidates its\n    investments in these projects in accordance with FIN No. 46(R) at\n    a consolidation percentage that is reflected in the Pro-Rata %\n    column. These advances entitle the Company to a preferred return\n    on investment, which is payable from cash flows of each respective\n    property. At the point the Company is no longer entitled to a\n    preferred return on a particular joint venture because the\n    partner\'s advance has been repaid in full, the Company\'s net\n    assets will be adjusted to its intended ownership percentage\n    (reflected in the Legal Ownership % column) by recording a\n    minority interest to reflect the amount of the partner\'s claim on\n    those net assets.\n\n\n                            Net Operating Income (in Thousands)\n                     -------------------------------------------------\n                             Three Months Ended July 31, 2004\n                     -------------------------------------------------\n                                          Plus\n                                         Unconsol-   Plus\n                                         idated     Discont-\n                       Full      Less     Invest-   inued    Pro-Rata\n                      Consol-  Minority ments at     Opera-   Consol-\n                      idation  Interest  Pro-Rata    tions    idation\n                     --------- -------- ---------- --------- ---------\nCommercial Group\n     Retail\n\n       Comparable     $29,833   $4,185     $3,235        $-   $28,883\n\n       ---------------------------------------------------------------\n       Total           38,649    2,332      2,562       600    39,479\n     Office\n      Buildings\n\n       Comparable      35,518    5,940      1,015         -
