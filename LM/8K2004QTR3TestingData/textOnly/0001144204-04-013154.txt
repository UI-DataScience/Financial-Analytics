Reports Record Revenues and Increased\n                  Earnings for Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2004\n\nFARMINGDALE,  N.Y.,  August 25,  2004  Misonix,  Inc.  (NASDAQ  NM:  MSON) today\nreported  financial results for the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2004.\nHighlights for the fiscal year 2004 include:\n\n      o     Revenues  for the twelve  months ended June 30, 2004  increased  12%\n            from the prior  year  driven by a 22%  increase  in  medical  device\n            product revenues.\n      o     Net income increased 78% to $1.7 million for the twelve months ended\n            June 30, 2004 as compared to $968,000 from the same period in fiscal\n            2003.\n      o     The backlog of unfilled orders was $8.7 million, a 56% increase from\n            that of June 30,  2003.\n      o     Sales of the Sonablate 500 (SB 500) have started in Europe.\n      o     The  submission of a 510k  application  to the FDA for  laparoscopic\n            ablation.\n\nRevenues for the three months  ended June 30, 2004 were $10.8  million  compared\nwith $10.9 million for the same period in fiscal 2003. The Company  recorded net\nincome for the quarter of $548,000 or $.08 per fully diluted share,  compared to\nnet income of  $559,000 or $.08 per fully  diluted  share for the same period in\nfiscal 2003.  Medical device product  revenues  decreased 3% to $5.6 million and\nlaboratory and scientific  product  revenues  increased 1% to $5.2 million.  The\ndecrease in medical device product revenues was attributed to an 18% decrease in\ndiagnostic  medical device  revenues to $2.3 million  partially  offset by a 12%\nincrease in therapeutic medical device revenues to $3.3 million. The increase in\nlaboratory  and  scientific  product  revenues was mainly  attributable  to a 6%\nincrease  in sales of  endoscopic  cleaning  and  disinfecting  units,  and a 2%\nincrease  in  sales of  ductless  fume  enclosures,  partially  offset  by a 20%\nreduction  in sales of wet scrubber  products and an 8% reduction in  ultrasonic\nlaboratory product sales.\n\n', u'\n\nRevenues  for the twelve  months ended June 30, 2004 were $39.1  million,  a 12%\nincrease  when  compared  with $34.9 million for the same period in fiscal 2003.\nThe Company  recorded  net income for the twelve  months  ended June 30, 2004 of\n$1.7 million or $.25 per fully  diluted  share,  a 78% increase when compared to\nnet income of  $968,000 or $.15 per fully  diluted  share for the same period in\nfiscal 2003.  Medical device product revenues increased 22% to $21.4 million and\nlaboratory and scientific  product revenues  increased 2% to $17.7 million.  The\nincrease in medical device product  revenues was attributed to a 38% increase in\ntherapeutic  medical  device  revenues  to $12.3  million  and a 6%  increase in\ndiagnostic  medical device revenues to $9.1 million.  The increase in laboratory\nand scientific  product  revenues was mainly  attributable  to a 10% increase in\nultrasonic  laboratory  product  sales and a 6% increase in sales of  Labcaire\'s\nendoscopic  cleaning and disinfecting units partially offset by a 5% decrease in\nductless fume enclosure sales and a 23% reduction in wet scrubber sales.\n\nAs of June 30,  2004,  the backlog of unfilled  orders was $8.7  million,  a 56%\nincrease  when compared  with $5.6 million as of June 30, 2003.

Medical\ndevices  have shown  growth at a rate in excess of 20%. We also  continue to see\nthe kind of increase in backlog to provide the basis for our future growth.\n\n"We expect medical device sales to grow as a result of sales of a newly designed\nneuroaspirator,   continued  sales  of  the  SB500  and  the  market\'s   overall\nrecognition of the importance of High Intensity Focused Ultrasound technology.\n\n"We have  completed  our animal  studies  with the  prototype of our product for\nkidney and liver cancer treatment.  As previously reported, we have a submission\nbefore the FDA for the approval of laparoscopic ablation of tissue.\n\n"We anticipate our Sonora  business will continue to expand as a result of new R\n& D efforts in probes,  MRI and probe  testing.  Recognition of that unique work\nhas resulted in the growing network of international distributors.\n\n"We  expect  to see a pick up in the  sales  of our  laboratory  and  scientific\nproducts  as a  result  of a  recovery  in  some of our  markets  and  from  the\nidentification of new market niches."\n\nMr. McManus continued, "We believe that the significant growth we are showing in\nrevenues  and  earnings  together  with our new  product  pipelines  establishes\nMisonix as a leader in the application of ultrasound for medical devices."\n\nRegarding  guidance,  the Company said that it is expecting to increase revenues\nby 10%-15% and earnings by 30% for fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004.\n\n', u'\n\nMisonix  develops,   manufactures,   and/or  markets  medical,   scientific  and\nindustrial  ultrasonic and air pollution systems and maintains a minority equity\nposition in Focus Surgery as its exclusive manufacturer of the Sonablate 500.\n\nForward Looking  Statements:  Statements in this news release looking forward in\ntime are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor  Provisions of the Private  Securities\nLitigation  Reform Act of 1995.
