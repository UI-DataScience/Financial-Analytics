', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Accounting practices review, restatement and\nremedial actions we are taking ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'As the result of an\naccounting practices review initiated in April 2003, we announced in July 2003 that investors should not rely on our historical financial statements and auditors\x92 reports thereon or our financial results announced for any period and that we\nintended to restate previously reported financial results for our fiscal year ended March\xa02, 2002, and for the first three quarters of our fiscal year ended March\xa01, 2003. That accounting practice review was recently completed. Until that\ntime, it was not possible for us to issue audited financial statements for the fiscal years 2003 or 2004, or unaudited financial statements for interim periods related to those fiscal years or subsequent interim periods. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'A detailed summary of the restatement process that evolved from the review of\nour accounting practices is set forth in Note\xa03 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Exhibit\xa099.2. In connection with performing its audit of our financial statements as of and for the year ended March\xa01, 2003,\nour independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has communicated to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors a substantial number of material weaknesses and other deficiencies relating to our internal controls over\nfinancial reporting. Ernst & Young\x92s consideration of our internal controls in connection with the performance of its audit would not necessarily result in identification of all internal control deficiencies that might be reportable\nconditions. Among the material weaknesses identified by Ernst & Young were: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'Prior management\x92s review process failed to prevent or detect the lack of compliance with and, in certain cases, the circumvention of, the Company\x92s procedures and\ncontrols. Examples include: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'Arrangements to sell products to customers that were contingent on, and substantially funded by, the Company\x92s purchase of convertible debt or equity securities issued by these\ncustomers (or by third parties), where, after discovering previously undisclosed Company communications, the sales and investment transactions appeared to have little or questionable substance. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'Previously undisclosed formal and informal side agreements with the Company\x92s resellers and other customers were uncovered that changed the substance of revenue arrangements\nand resulted in inappropriate revenue recognition. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'The experience and depth of our financial and accounting personnel needed to be increased. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'The controls surrounding the proper timing of recording accounts payable, including consistent and proper use of purchase orders, were inadequate. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'There were deficiencies in controls over fixed asset tracking and related accounting including controls over physical identity, movement and disposals of fixed assets.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'The accounting for goods received but not invoiced was not consistently applied, including timely relief of items credited to this account. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'There was a lack of overall documentation and recordkeeping for both electronic and hard copy documents including maintaining in an organized fashion appropriate originals or copies\nof contracts, invoices, purchase orders, and other supporting information that enable management to both comply with regulatory requirements to maintain proper books and records and permit those needing access the ability to do so in a timely\nfashion. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'We have taken the following steps since August 2003 in response to certain of the deficiencies noted\nabove: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'We established a Business Operations group, reporting directly to the Chief Financial Officer, which is responsible for management of sales proposal response, pre-approval of\nquotations, pipeline management and reporting, and sales commission accounting. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'An automated sales quotation tool was implemented, which produces proposal information, requires a specific response to over twenty corporate governance and revenue recognition\nquestions, and calculates proposed gross margin. The sales quotation tool is jointly administered by the Business Operations group and Order Administration, which also reports to the Chief Financial Officer. Exceptions require the approval of the\nChief Financial Officer, and in certain cases the Chief Executive Officer. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'All commissioned sales personnel are required to certify on a quarterly basis whether they are aware of any undocumented terms and conditions, including rights of return or stock\nrotation, or any other form of \x93side letter,\x94 which would change the nature of a revenue transaction. Sales commissions are withheld until the certifications are received. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'The Chief Financial Officer and the Vice President of Finance conduct a quarterly revenue recognition review of all revenue transactions in excess of $250,000 and $100,000,\nrespectively. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'The Chief Financial Officer and/or Vice President of Finance, along with the General Counsel, conduct revenue recognition and corporate governance training at initial sales\norientation and internal sales conferences, which are held at least twice a year. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'The Chief Financial Officer and other senior officers conduct periodic visits with the Company\x92s customers, resellers and field personnel to assess whether internal controls\nover the revenue recognition and field accounting processes are functioning as designed. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'New accounts payable and fixed asset procedures have been established and personnel trained in the proper functioning of the controls. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'We engaged an independent international public accounting firm to assist us in meeting our requirements under \xa7404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. They are assisting us in\nevaluating the internal control environment and assessing our risks, documenting significant processes, testing the effectiveness of the controls and designing appropriate processes and controls where deficiencies are noted.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'We terminated or secured the resignation of certain Company officers and various sales, operational and financial personnel. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'We executed a near-complete turnover in the composition of our senior management team, including appointment of a new President and Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President\nand Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Finance and Corporate Controller, Vice President Sales, North America and Senior Vice President, and General Counsel, who also serves as the Company\x92s Chief Compliance Officer.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'The Finance organization was strengthened with the addition of experienced professionals, including four individuals who are Certified Public Accountants. Recruitment of additional\nexperienced finance personnel is in process. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'We established the position of Vice President Internal Audit, reporting jointly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and to the Chief Financial Officer. Recruitment of a qualified\ncandidate is in process. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'We appointed a Disclosure Committee presently consisting of the Company\x92s Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel. The Committee determines materiality of information and\ndetermines the Company\x92s disclosure obligations in a timely manner. The Disclosure Committee will be expanded to include the Vice President of Finance and Director of Investor Relations as appropriate. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'We appointed three new independent members to the seven member Board of Directors, all three of whom now serve on the Audit Committee. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'We established a phone and web-based anonymous reporting process for reporting improper conduct in any part of our business, including, without limitations, our Sales, Finance, and\nBusiness Operations departments in accordance with \xa7301 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'We believe these efforts have established a framework to materially improve our control structure. While\nwe have committed considerable resources to date on the accounting practices review and remedial actions listed above, all of the intended benefits will not occur immediately, nor do the above-listed remedial actions address all of the deficiencies\nidentified by Ernst & Young. Additional efforts will be necessary to remediate all of the deficiencies in our control structure. Our controls are improving and management believes that the financial statements included in this Form 8-K are\nfairly presented, in all material respects, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including our own, is subject to certain limitations, including the exercise of\njudgment in designing, implementing and evaluating the controls and procedures and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Financial information ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Exhibit 99.2 of this Form 8-K includes audited consolidated financial statements and certain other information for our fiscal year ended on March 1, 2003.\nExhibit\xa099.2 does not include all of the information required to be presented in an Annual Report on Form\xa010-K in order for it to be fully compliant with Securities and Exchange Commission Rules and Regulations. For example, the\nconsolidated financial statements included in Exhibit\xa099.2 do not contain a comparative consolidated balance sheet dated as of March\xa02, 2002, or comparative consolidated statements of operations, cash flows or stockholders\x92 equity for\nfiscal years 2001 or 2002. Furthermore, it does not include other financial information required to be included in an Annual Report on Form\xa010-K, such as selected financial data, management\x92s discussion and analysis of results of\noperations and financial condition and supplementary data. While we believed it was important for us to furnish audited financial statements for fiscal year 2003 to investors as soon as such financial statements were available, we concluded that,\ngiven the age of the financial statements and that comparative financial information was not being presented, preparation of management\x92s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition for fiscal year 2003 would not be\nmeaningful to investors. Concurrently with the submission of this Form\xa08-K to the Securities and Exchange Commission, we are also filing quarterly reports on Form\xa010-Q containing our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\nfor each of the first three quarters of the Company\x92s fiscal year 2004. Those filings contain management\x92s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition, including the discussion of our critical accounting\npolicies. We believe the audited financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended March\xa01, 2003 furnished in this Form\xa08-K, together with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements filed in our Forms\xa010-Q for\neach of the first three quarters of fiscal year 2004, should provide relevant and useful financial information to investors. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Exhibit 99.3 to this Form 8-K is the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated as of December 18, 2002, among Riverstone Networks, Pipal\nSystems, Inc. and other parties signatory thereto (the \x93Pipal Systems Merger Agreement\x94). Exhibit 99.4 to this Form 8-K is the Consulting Agreement Amended and Restated as of November 17, 2002 by and between Richard Lowenthal and Pipal\nSystems, Inc. If the Company had timely filed its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 1, 2003, these agreements would have been filed therewith. Accordingly, the Company is filing these agreements along with the financial statements with which\nthey originally would have been filed. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We are not filing\naudited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years 2001, 2002 or 2004 at this time. As previously announced, we intend to file audited financial statements for our 2004 fiscal year in the near future. We cannot currently predict when, if\never, we will be able to reissue audited consolidated financial statements for our fiscal years 2001 or 2002.

(RSTN.PK), a leading provider of carrier class solutions for next generation Metro Ethernet networks, today announced that it has completed its audited financial statements for fiscal year 2003 and unaudited\nfinancial statements for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2004. The statements were submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission before the open of the market. Financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 1, 2003, including the\nreport thereon by the company\x92s independent registered public accounting firm, were furnished on Form 8-K; and the first three quarters of fiscal year 2004 ended May 31, August 30 and November 29, 2003 were filed on Forms 10-Q. The company said\nit intends to submit audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2004 in the near future, and will provide an update on the timing of this filing in mid-September. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'As a result of the previously announced review of its accounting practices, the company uncovered previously undisclosed communications by\nformer company employees, as well as other information calling into question the appropriateness and timing of revenues recognized from certain customers. Among the matters discovered were: (i) unauthorized side arrangements and other evidence of\nunauthorized promises made by certain former company employees that provided customers, particularly resellers, with undisclosed rights of return or other forms of concession not previously communicated and, therefore, which were not previously\naccounted for in the company\x92s consolidated financial statements, (ii) evidence indicating revenue was improperly recognized on sales to customers in which the company had an investment interest that did not have business substance, and (iii)\nimproper accounting for barter transactions. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Fiscal Year 2003', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The audited financial statements for the fiscal year 2003 reflect a\npreviously reported opening accumulated deficit balance of $72.2 million as of March 2, 2002. As a result of adjustments discovered in the course of the accounting practices review, this opening balance has been increased by $95.0 million, resulting\nin a restated accumulated deficit of $167.2 million as of March 2, 2002. The components of the restatement adjustments include the following items: ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xb7', u'\n', u'The company made a significant change in its revenue recognition accounting policy for sales to resellers from recognition on shipment (i.e., on a \x93sell-in\x94 basis) to\nrecognition upon sale by the reseller (i.e., on a \x93sell-through\x94 basis). The impact of the change in accounting was to increase the previously reported accumulated deficit by $31.4 million. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xb7', u'\n', u'The investigation disclosed that certain of the company\x92s previously recorded sale/investment transactions lacked business substance. The company reevaluated those transactions\nand reversed substantially all of those investments, as well as revenue previously recorded prior to, contemporaneously with, or after acquiring an equity interest in those customers. The impact of the related adjustments was to increase the\npreviously reported accumulated deficit by $51.7 million, and had a significant impact on previously reported assets.

The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. Some of the\nsecurities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the investment to fluctuate. To minimize this risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents,\nshort-term investments and long-term investments in a variety of forms, including commercial paper, government and non-government debt securities and money market funds. Our portfolio had an average life of less than one year as of March 1, 2003. We\ngenerally place our investments with high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer or fund. Based upon our investment portfolio, we determined that it was reasonably possible that an interest rate\nincrease or decrease of 50 basis points could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 0.50% (50 basis points) change in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $1.6 million in the fair market value of the\nportfolio. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our convertible subordinated notes were issued at a\nfixed interest rate and with fixed conversion rates and, therefore, do not expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates. However, the interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of our convertible\nsubordinated notes and expose us to a risk of economic loss. We have performed a sensitivity analysis as of March 1, 2003, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the\nlevels of interest rates with all other variables held constant. The analysis covers our fixed rate convertible subordinated notes and is based upon our assumed overall maturity of five years for the long-term debt. The discount rate used was based\nupon the market interest rate in effect at March 1, 2003. The sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the interest rate would result in a decrease in the fair value of our convertible subordinated debt of\napproximately $2.0 million at March 1, 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Foreign\nCurrency Risk Management ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The Company transacts business\nin various non-U.S. currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro and Japanese Yen. The Company has established a foreign currency risk management program designed to protect against reductions in value and volatility of future cash flows caused by\nchanges in exchange rates. The Company uses currency forward contracts in these risk management programs. This program reduces, but does not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements. Based upon our currency sensitivity\nanalysis as of March 1, 2003, a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rates of the British Pound, the Euro and the Japanese Yen would yield a change in fair value of our forward contracts by approximately $0.2\xa0million for all\ncontracts.

Business Operations ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Riverstone Networks, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively \x93Riverstone\x94 or the \x93Company\x94) is a leading provider of data\ntransmission routing equipment for metro Ethernet networks. Riverstone\x92s metro routers and accompanying products are designed to meet customers\x92 IP networking requirements in support of voice, video, and data services. Riverstone products\nenable carriers to offer these services across existing revenue-generating networks and new Ethernet deployments. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The Company was created by the combination of two businesses previously acquired by Cabletron Systems, Inc. (\x93Cabletron\x94) and renamed\nRiverstone. Riverstone completed its initial public offering on February 22, 2001. On August 6, 2001, (the \x93Distribution Date\x94), Cabletron distributed all of its shares of Riverstone\x92s common stock to its stockholders, and Riverstone\nceased to be a subsidiary of Cabletron. These accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the historical basis of the Cabletron-owned assets and liabilities, which were transferred at the Distribution Date.

All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'(b) Fiscal Year-End ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The Company utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to the last calendar day in February. The fiscal year ended March 1, 2003\n(\x93fiscal year 2003\x94) includes 52 weeks. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'(c) Use\nof Estimates ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The preparation of financial statements in\nconformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'(d) Concentration of Credit Risk ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration\nof credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and trade receivables. The Company\x92s investment policy is designed to limit exposure from any one institution. The Company performs periodic\nevaluations of the relative credit standing of the financial institutions that are considered in its investment strategy. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of default by the financial institutions or issuers of investments to the\nextent of the amount recorded on the balance sheet. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The\nCompany\x92s non-reseller customers include local exchange carriers, long distance carriers, inter-exchange carriers, Internet service providers, metropolitan service providers, content hosting providers and cable operators. The Company\x92s\nnetwork of resellers consists of companies that are typically not highly capitalized and if anticipated levels of sell-through are not achieved, then the Company\x92s ability to collect receivables from such customers could be adversely affected.\nThe Company performs periodic credit evaluations of both its reseller and non-reseller customers\x92 financial condition and generally does not require collateral or other security against trade receivable balances. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'7 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'RIVERSTONE NETWORKS, INC. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\x97(Continued) ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'(e) Cash and Cash Equivalents and Investments ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Riverstone considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity\nof 90 days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of money market funds, commercial paper and government securities. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'At March 1, 2003, all marketable debt and equity securities were designated as available-for-sale and are reported at fair market value with unrealized\ngains and losses, net of income taxes, included in \x93Accumulated other comprehensive income\x94 as a separate component of stockholders\x92 equity in the consolidated balance sheet. When the fair value of an investment declines below its\noriginal cost, the Company considers all available evidence to evaluate whether the decline in value is other-than-temporary. Among other things, the Company considers the duration and extent to which the market value has declined relative to its\ncost basis and economic factors influencing the markets. Unrealized losses considered other-than-temporary are charged to \x93Other income\x94 in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the determination is made. The gain\nor loss on securities sold is based upon the specific identification method. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'(f) Accounts Receivable ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The Company continually monitors and evaluates the collectibility of its trade receivables based upon a combination of factors. Riverstone records specific allowances for bad debts when it becomes aware of a specific customer\x92s\ninability to meet its financial obligation such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or substantial deterioration of financial position. The Company uses estimates in determining its allowances for all other customers based upon factors such as\ncurrent trends, the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'(g) Inventories ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Inventory cost is computed on a currently adjusted standard basis (which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis). Finished goods\ninventory is determined to be saleable based upon a demand forecast within a specific time horizon, generally 12 months or less. Inventory carrying values are adjusted for quantities in excess of estimated future demand or obsolescence, and the\nremaining inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'(h) Property and Equipment ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Property and\nequipment are stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which, for equipment and software range from 3 to 5 years, for furniture and\nfixtures are 5 years and for leasehold improvements are the lesser of the estimated useful life or the lease term. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'(i) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated amortization recognized through March 2, 2002. The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting\nStandards (\x93SFAS\x94) No. 142, ', u'Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ', u'(\x93SFAS 142\x94)', u',', u' on March 3, 2002. SFAS 142 requires that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized and,\ninstead, be tested for impairment on a periodic basis. The Company tests goodwill for impairment using the two-step process prescribed in SFAS 142. The first step is to screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of the\nimpairment, if any. The Company performs goodwill impairment tests annually and whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that goodwill might be impaired. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'8 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'RIVERSTONE NETWORKS, INC. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\x97(Continued) ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'To test for goodwill impairment, the Company performs a fair value assessment of the Company\x92s\nsingle reporting unit and compares the fair value to its carrying amount. Based on this analysis, the Company concluded there was no impairment of the goodwill at December 2, 2002, the date of the Company\x92s annual test. However, future goodwill\nimpairment tests could result in a charge to earnings. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Intangible assets with definite lives consist of workforce-in-place and purchased technology. Amortization is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 3 years and 4 years, respectively. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'(j) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In accordance with SFAS No. 144, ', u'Accounting for the Impairment or\nDisposal of Long-Lived Assets,', u' Riverstone periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment, when events and circumstances indicate that the book value of an asset may not be\nrecoverable. If, in the future, management determines the existence of impairment indicators, the Company would generally use undiscounted cash flows to initially determine whether impairment should be recognized. If necessary, the Company would\nperform a subsequent calculation to measure the amount of the impairment loss based upon the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the impaired assets. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'(k) Revenue Recognition ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The Company derives its revenue primarily from two sources: a) hardware products revenue and b) services and support revenue. The Company considers the\nfollowing basic criteria in evaluating revenue recognition on its sales transactions: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'When a sale involves multiple deliverables, such as bundled products and\nservices, that represent separate units of accounting, the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective deliverable based upon its relative fair value or using the residual method, as circumstances dictate. The amounts allocated\nare recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each deliverable are met. The amount and timing of product and service revenue recognized is affected by management\x92s judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and,\nif so, whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for those deliverables. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The majority of the Company\x92s sales are generated through its resellers. Revenue from these customers is generally recognized on the sell-through basis of revenue recognition, provided persuasive evidence of an\narrangement exists and the price is fixed or determinable. Because of the Company\x92s present inability to obtain reliable evidence of physical sell-through information from all of its resellers for historical transactions, management has\nconcluded that, in general, cash receipt currently provides the most relevant evidence of sell-through. However, in cases where cash has been received and the Company has reliable evidence that the product has not been sold through, revenue is\ndeferred until the Company obtains reliable evidence of sell-through. Related service and maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the period the services are performed, once cash has been received. The associated cost of hardware products\nrevenue is also deferred until the earlier of when management determines the carrying value of the related inventory is not otherwise recoverable or revenue recognition occurs. As presented in the consolidated balance sheet, \x93Deferred income on\nshipments to resellers\x94 includes deferred revenue less associated deferred cost of products sold.

', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\x97(Continued) ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'The Company generally recognizes revenue and related cost of revenue upon shipment of products to\nnon-resellers, provided that there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. If uncertainties exist, revenue\nis recognized when the uncertainties are resolved. Revenues from service and maintenance contracts from non-reseller customers are recognized ratably over the period the services are performed, typically 1 to 5 years. The Company provides a reserve\nfor estimated non-reseller returns based upon historical returns, contractual rights, analysis of credit memo data and return policies. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Many customers purchase extended service and maintenance contracts for terms typically ranging from 1 to 5 years. These contracts are accounted for in\naccordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\x93FASB\x94) Technical Bulletin 90-1, ', u'Accounting for Separately Priced Extended Warranty and Product Maintenance Contracts.', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'(l) Warranty Costs ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The Company accrues estimated warranty costs at the time of product\nshipment. The Company\x92s standard warranty period generally extends twelve months from the date of shipment and the Company\x92s warranty accrual represents the best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on\nproducts sold as of the balance sheet date. The Company\x92s estimates for warranty costs are based upon its installed base, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and actual costs of repair or replacement. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'(m) Shipping Costs ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Shipping costs are charged to cost of revenues as incurred. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'(n) Stock-Based Compensation ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The Company accounts for its employee stock compensation plans, consisting\nof a stock option plan and a stock purchase plan, under the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (\x93APB\x94) Opinion No. 25, ', u'Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ', u'(\x93Opinion 25\x94) and related\ninterpretations. Under Opinion 25, compensation expense is recognized on the measurement date based upon the difference, if any, between the fair value of the Company\x92s common stock and the amount an employee must pay to acquire the common\nstock. The Company amortizes expense associated with stock-based compensation under Opinion 25, generally acquisition-related compensation expense and expense related to options granted prior to the Company\x92s initial public offering, on a\nstraight-line basis over the vesting period, generally four years.

The FASB issued FIN 46R, a revision to FIN 46, in December 2003. FIN 46R establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of a variable interest entity (\x93VIE\x94), formerly referred to as special\npurpose entities. FIN 46R applies to any business enterprise, both public and private, that has a controlling interest, contractual relationship or other business relationship with a VIE. FIN 46 provides guidance for determining when an entity (the\n\x93Primary Beneficiary\x94) should consolidate another entity, a VIE, that functions to support the activities of the Primary Beneficiary. FIN 46R deferred the effective date of FIN 46 for public companies to the end of the first reporting\nperiod ending after March 15, 2004, except that all public companies must at a minimum apply the unmodified provisions of FIN 46 to entities that were previously considered \x93special-purpose entities\x94 in practice and under the FASB\nliterature prior to the issuance of FIN 46R by the end of the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2003.

EITF 00-21 applies to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003.

A commitment to a plan to exit an activity or dispose of long-lived assets will no longer be sufficient to record a one-time charge for most restructuring activities. Instead, companies will record exit\nor disposal costs when they are \x93incurred\x94 and can be measured at fair value. In addition, the resultant liabilities will be subsequently adjusted for changes in estimated cash flows. SFAS 146 is effective prospectively for exit or\ndisposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. Companies may not restate previously issued financial statements for the effect of the provisions of SFAS 146, and liabilities previously recorded under EITF\xa094-3 are grandfathered.

SFAS 145 amends SFAS No. 13, ', u'Accounting for Leases', u' (\x93SFAS 13\x94) to require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to\nsale-leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale-leaseback transactions. This amendment is consistent with the FASB\x92s goal of requiring similar accounting treatment for transactions that have similar economic effects. In\naddition, SFAS 145 makes technical corrections to existing pronouncements. While those corrections are not substantive in nature, in some instances they may change accounting practice. SFAS 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15,\n2002 for the provisions related to the rescission of Statements 4, as amended, and for all transactions entered into beginning May 15, 2002 for the provision related to the amendment of SFAS 13, although early adoption is permitted.

', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Note 3. Restatement ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'On April 25, 2003, the Company announced that it had received a request from\nthe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\x93SEC\x94) for the voluntary production of certain information in connection with the Company\x92s accounting practices, specifically related to recognizing revenue for sales transactions\ninvolving contingencies, sales to customers in which the Company may have had an investment interest, and sales to customers from whom the Company was purchasing product at or about the same time. The SEC subsequently issued a formal order of\ninvestigation. In response to the SEC\x92s request, the Company began voluntarily cooperating with the SEC and also commenced an internal investigation of its accounting practices under the direction of a Special Committee of its Board of\nDirectors. The Special Committee engaged independent outside counsel and independent forensic accountants to perform the investigation. The investigation discovered previously undisclosed Company communications and other information calling into\nquestion the appropriateness and timing of revenues recognized from certain customers. Among the matters discovered in the course of the investigation were: (i) unauthorized side arrangements and other evidence of unauthorized promises made by\ncertain former Company representatives that provided customers, particularly resellers, with undisclosed rights of return or other forms of concession not previously communicated and, therefore, which were not previously accounted for in the\nCompany\x92s consolidated financial statements, (ii) evidence indicating revenue was improperly recognized on sales to customers in which the Company had an investment interest that did not have business substance, and (iii) improper accounting\nfor barter transactions. Based upon the preliminary findings of the investigation, the Company announced on July 21, 2003 that investors should not rely on its historical financial statements and auditors\x92 reports thereon or its financial\nresults announced for any period and that it intended to restate its previously reported consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 2, 2002, and its previously reported interim consolidated financial statements for the first\nthree quarters of fiscal year 2003. As a result of the restatement process, the Company delayed the filing of its fiscal year 2003 and 2004 Annual Reports on Form 10-K and the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ending May 31, 2003,\nAugust 30, 2003, November 29, 2003 and May 29, 2004. The Special Committee completed its investigation in September 2003 and directed Company management to complete the restatement process thereafter. The Company\x92s restatement process included\ninitiation of a program intended to correct internal control deficiencies that contributed to conduct of, and the failure to detect, the unauthorized activities that resulted in the restatements of previously reported fiscal year 2002 and 2003\nfinancial information. In the course of implementing this program, management has satisfied itself that all employees believed to be involved in unauthorized activities have either resigned or been terminated.

As noted above, various adjustments have been recorded related to findings of the\ninvestigation conducted under the direction of the Board of Directors. Many of these adjustments have been recorded in specific periods using the benefit of hindsight as the Company believes such presentation is the most appropriate even though such\nadjustments may not have been recorded in those specific periods had the Company issued its financial statements on a timely basis. As discussed below, the Company\x92s restatement process included making a significant change in its revenue\nrecognition accounting policy for sales to resellers, from recognition on shipment (i.e., on a \x93sell-in\x94 basis) to recognition upon sale by the reseller (i.e., on a \x93sell-through\x94 basis). This change from sell-in to sell-through\naccounting had a significant impact on previously reported allowances for doubtful accounts and customer returns, inventories and deferred income and revenue. Additionally, based upon the findings of the investigation, which indicated certain of the\nCompany\x92s sale/investment transactions lacked business substance, the Company reevaluated those transactions and reversed substantially all of those investments, as well as revenue previously recorded prior to, contemporaneously with, or after\nacquiring an equity interest in those customers. The related adjustments had a significant impact on previously reported long-term investments. Lastly, in the course of preparing the restated consolidated balance sheet at March 2, 2002 to properly\nreflect its sales and investment transactions, the Company identified other items and errors for which accounting adjustments were necessary.

Business arrangements with the Company\x92s resellers were previously\nbelieved to require payment within a customary collection period and provide limited return rights under specific circumstances. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 48, ', u'Revenue Recognition When Right-of-Return Exists', u' (\x93SFAS 48\x94),\nspecific criteria must be met for revenue to be recognized upon shipment when the buyer has the explicit or implicit right to return the product.

It was found that certain former Company representatives had\nprovided concessions outside the authorized contractual terms, including the right to return unsold product for a refund or credit (a \x93stock return\x94), or exchange unsold product for different product (a \x93stock rotation\x94). In\naddition, in some instances, pursuant to unauthorized side arrangements or other understandings, resellers were not obligated to pay for delivered products until they had sold them to end user customers. The pervasiveness of unauthorized side\narrangements and granting of various forms of concessions caused the Company to conclude that the sell-in model was not appropriate for sales to resellers. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements reflect a revenue recognition policy for\nsales to resellers on a sell-through basis. Because of the Company\x92s present inability to obtain reliable evidence of physical sell-through information from all of its resellers for historical transactions, management has concluded that, in\ngeneral, cash receipt currently provides the most relevant evidence of sell-through. However, in cases where cash has been received and the Company has reliable evidence that product has not sold through, revenue remains deferred until the Company\nobtains reliable evidence of sell-through. The impact on the previously reported March 2, 2002 accumulated deficit from the change to the sell-through basis of revenue recognition on sales to resellers was an increase of $31.4 million.

As a result of the Special Committee\x92s investigation and additional procedures performed by management, the Company has determined that\nsubstantially all of these transactions either lacked economic substance or the fair value of the underlying equity investments was unreliable because certain former Company representatives had inappropriately influenced the valuation process. As a\nresult, the carrying value of substantially all such investments was reduced by the amount of product or service revenue previously recognized in the restatement of the Company\x92s consolidated balance sheet at March 2, 2002. The remaining\nbalance of equity investments in customers totals $0.3 million at March 1, 2003.

As a result of the Special Committee\x92s investigation and additional procedures performed by management, the Company subsequently determined that it had\nimproperly recognized revenue and capitalized costs associated with some of these transactions. Accordingly, adjustments were recorded to offset the originally capitalized amounts against the related revenues as of the original transaction dates.\nThe impact on the previously reported March 2, 2002 accumulated deficit from these adjustments was an increase of $6.0 million.

In these instances, the Company deferred recognition of revenue until all revenue recognition criteria were met. In addition, the Company identified a limited number of non-reseller customers to whom return\nrights and stock rotation rights were granted after payment had been received. Based on these findings, the Company has continued to defer the recognition of revenue, after cash has been received, by the amount that such specified non-resellers were\npermitted to return.

Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the Company issued 0.4 million shares of\nunrestricted and 6.9\xa0million shares of restricted common stock and agreed to pay $4.2 million in cash in exchange for all of Pipal\x92s outstanding capital stock. In addition, the Company agreed to pay $0.3 million and to grant stock options\nto purchase 0.7 million shares of the Company\x92s common stock for Pipal\x92s outstanding stock options. The cash consideration is payable 10 years after the closing of the transaction with an accelerated payout over a vesting period, ranging\nfrom the closing of the transaction to 4 years, if the individual remains employed by Riverstone. The Company also assumed debt totaling $6.6 million. Prior to the acquisition of Pipal, the Company had made loans to Pipal in the amount of $0.7\nmillion, which were forgiven in connection with the net asset purchase. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Riverstone recorded the cost of the Pipal asset purchase at $23.3 million, including direct costs of $0.8 million, based upon the cash consideration payable and the value of unrestricted and restricted shares issued and stock options\ngranted to the shareholders of Pipal.

The Notes are due December\xa01, 2006. The Notes are subordinated to any future senior indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company. The Notes are\nconvertible, at the option of the holders, into common shares at a conversion rate of 55.0661 shares per one thousand dollars principal amount of Notes at any time before the maturity date, subject to adjustment in certain events. In lieu of issuing\ncommon shares, the Company may choose to make a cash payment equal to 105% of the value of the common shares issuable upon conversion. The Notes are redeemable at the Company\x92s option, in whole or in part, on or after December 3, 2004, at a\nredemption price of 100% plus accrued and unpaid interest. Each holder of the Notes has the right to cause the Company to repurchase all of such holder\x92s convertible notes at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest upon the\noccurrence of certain events, including but not limited to, liquidation, consolidation, merger or re-capitalization. Interest on the Notes is paid semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning June 1, 2002. The related\ndebt issuance costs of $5.0 million are amortized on the straight-line basis to the maturity date of the Notes.

Under the Offer, the Company would offer to exchange outstanding vested and unvested stock options held by eligible employees for\nreplacement stock options. Depending upon the exercise price per share underlying the employee\x92s tendered stock option, the number of shares of common stock underlying the replacement stock option would equal 0.25 to 1.0 times the number of\nshares underlying the tendered option. Alternatively, eligible employees holding a stock option with an exercise price per share greater than or equal to $10.00 were entitled to tender such option for either a replacement option or a cash payment\nequal to $0.50 multiplied by 25% of the aggregate number of shares underlying the tendered option (rounded down to the nearest whole share), less any applicable withholding taxes or charges. Under the terms of the Offer, an eligible employee who\nelected to tender any option was also required to exchange any other options granted to such employee within the six months prior to October 15, 2002, regardless of the exercise price per share underlying such options, and all options with an\nexercise price per share greater than or equal to $5.00 per share.

', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Sales of Accounts\nReceivable ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Historically, the Company sold certain trade\naccounts receivables to a third party finance entity, with limited recourse. According to the related accounts receivable sale agreements, the Company retains the servicing of these receivables. The sale of the accounts receivable is recorded at\nfair value with the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the assets sold included in \x93Interest expense\x94 in the consolidated statement of operations. This difference between the carrying value and the fair value is\nprincipally the estimated discount inherent in the sales agreement, which reflects the borrowing costs. In fiscal year 2003 the Company sold $13.8 million in receivables. Total interest expense recorded with respect to the accounts receivable sales\nwas $0.9 million in fiscal year 2003. The Company discontinued its practice of selling accounts receivable in November 2002. At March 1, 2003, $1.5 million in sold trade accounts receivable remained outstanding. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Litigation Matters ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Beginning in July 2002, several complaints were filed in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Northern District of California, on behalf of purported classes of persons who purchased Riverstone\x92s securities at various times between August 10, 2001 and June 19, 2002. The complaints name as defendants the Company and certain\nof its officers and directors. They allege that the defendants violated federal securities laws by making false and misleading statements about the Company\x92s business and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. On September 25,\n2002, these actions were consolidated under the caption ', u'In re Riverstone Networks, Inc. Securities Litigation,', u' Case No. C-02-3581 PJH.

', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\x97(Continued) ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'Amended Complaint. In March 2004, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the class action.

Pursuant to SFAS No. 5, ', u'Accounting for Contingencies', u' (\x93SFAS\xa05\x94), the $18.5 million was accrued as a\ncharge to \x93Securities litigation settlement charges\x94 in the consolidated statement of operations.

The\ncomplaint alleges that the Company\x92s directors and officers made misrepresentations and/or omissions and breached their fiduciary duties to the Company in connection with the disclosure of the Company\x92s publicly reported financial results\nand statements and seeks unspecified damages as well as equitable and/or injunctive and other relief. On December 20, 2002, the defendants filed a demurrer to the complaint. On February 27, 2003, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. On or about\nApril 9, 2003, another shareholder derivative lawsuit, captioned ', u'Carrico v. Pereira, et al.', u', No. CV816188, alleging substantially similar claims to the ', u'Bruhn ', u'complaint, was filed in California Superior Court. On April 23, 2003, the\n', u'Bruhn', u' and ', u'Carrico', u' actions were consolidated under the caption ', u'In re Riverstone Networks, Inc. Derivative Litigation', u', No.\xa0CV810290. On or about May 28, 2003, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated shareholder derivative\ncomplaint. On or about February 14, 2003, a shareholder derivative lawsuit, captioned ', u'Watterson v. Pereira, et al.', u', No. C03-0637, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. In May 2004, the state and federal\nplaintiffs reached a settlement in principle with the Company. Under the agreed-upon settlement framework, the Company agreed to implement, or continue implementing, certain measures intended to improve corporate governance; in addition, the Company\nwill pay plaintiffs\x92 attorneys fees of $1.75 million. The resolution of the cases is subject to drafting and approval of a final settlement agreement and release, which is expected to occur later this calendar year. Pursuant to SFAS 5, the\n$1.75 million was accrued as a charge to \x93Securities litigation settlement charges\x94 in the consolidated statement of operations. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The Company is continuing to negotiate with its directors and officers\x92 liability insurers regarding the extent to which the insurers will reimburse\nsettlement and defense costs in various legal and SEC matters. While the Company has received to date $6.3 million in reimbursement (none of which was received in fiscal year 2003), the insurers have reserved their rights to assert that the claims\nrelated to the shareholder lawsuits are excluded from coverage under the applicable policies. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized any insurance recoveries in income, but rather has classified recoveries to date as a liability pending final\nresolution with the insurers. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In April 2003 the SEC commenced\nan informal inquiry regarding the Company\x92s accounting practices. The SEC subsequently issued a formal order of investigation. The Company is cooperating fully with the SEC. However, responding to the SEC review has required and will likely\ncontinue to require significant diversion of management\x92s attention and resources in the foreseeable future. If the SEC elects to pursue an enforcement action, the defense against this type of action could be costly and require additional\nmanagement resources. If the Company is unsuccessful in defending against this or other investigations or proceedings, it may face civil or criminal penalties or fines that would seriously harm Riverstone\x92s business and results of operations.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'On November 13, 2003, a patent infringement action captioned\n', u'Toshiba Corporation v.

Toshiba\x92s current complaint alleges that Riverstone infringes four\npatents relating to certain aspects of network communication. Toshiba is seeking to add two additional network communications patents to the lawsuit. Toshiba has not identified any specific Riverstone products or functionality of Riverstone\x92s\nproducts that would allegedly infringe those patents. Toshiba is seeking a permanent injunction and damages, but has not specified the amount of damages it is seeking. Toshiba also alleges that Riverstone has willfully infringed the patents, which\ncould result in an award of increased damages and attorneys\x92 fees. Riverstone has denied that it ', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'32 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'RIVERSTONE NETWORKS, INC.

', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In September 2003, Enterasys filed a demand for\narbitration against Riverstone with the American Arbitration Association in Boston, Massachusetts. Enterasys alleges that Riverstone is responsible for reimbursing Enterasys for approximately $13 million in costs purportedly related to the portion\nof the former Cabletron Systems business spun off with Riverstone. Riverstone has denied the allegations, and intends to vigorously defend against Enterasys\x92 action. The arbitration hearing has been set for September 2004.

Riverstone Networks, Inc., Case No', u'. 103CV011109 was filed in the California Superior Court for Santa Clara County. Global Asia Partners (GAP) alleges that Riverstone breached the limited partnership agreement by failing to fund a\ncapital call of approximately $1.1 million in May, 2003. GAP claims damages in the amount of the capital call, plus late fees and attorneys fees. In March 2004, GAP obtained a writ of attachment in the amount of approximately $1.3 million, and has\nserved a notice that it intends to apply the writ to the Company\x92s bank accounts. On July 22, 2004, GAP filed an amended complaint adding a claim for anticipatory breach of contract in connection with the remaining $3.0 million of capital calls\nspecified in the partnership agreement, and seeking damages in excess of $19.0 million including consequential damages. GAP has filed a motion for summary adjudication on the breach of contract claim only; that motion is scheduled to be heard on\nSeptember 30, 2004. Riverstone has denied the allegations, and intends to defend the action vigorously. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In February 2004, a breach of contract action captioned ', u'U.S. Bank N.A. v. Riverstone Networks, Inc.', u', Case No. 04-495, was filed in the United\nStates District Court for the Northern District of California. U.S. Bank, trustee for the holders who purchased approximately $132 million of the Company\x92s Notes, alleges that Riverstone is in breach of the indenture, the terms of which govern\nthe sale of the Notes. On April 2, 2004, Riverstone moved to dismiss the complaint. On May 3, 2004, U.S. Bank filed its papers in opposition to the motion to dismiss, and filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking immediate judgment in its favor.\nOn July\xa012, 2004, the Court denied both the trustee\x92s motion for summary judgment and the Company\x92s motion to dismiss. Riverstone has denied the allegations, and intends to defend the action vigorously. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Based on information presently available, the Company does not believe that\nthe outcome of the above described matters will have a material adverse impact on its results of operations, cash flows or financial condition beyond the amounts already recorded. It is possible, however, that an unfavorable resolution of any one or\na combination of these matters could occur and materially affect the Company\x92s future results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular period. The Company is not aware of any other legal proceedings against it that,\nindividually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results or financial condition. The Company may in the future be party to litigation arising in the course of its business, including claims that it\nallegedly infringes third-party patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights.

Subsequent Event ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In June 2004, the Company signed an agreement to sell its XGS enterprise technology platform and the associated software licenses to the ProCurve\nNetworking Business unit of Hewlett-Packard Company for $28 million. The transaction is part of Riverstone\x92s previously announced strategic decision to refocus on the service provider market. Under the terms of the transaction, ProCurve will\nobtain hardware design and software operating system technology along with all rights and interests needed to develop and manufacture products and solutions based on the XGS technology. The Company retains its ownership of the operating system\nsoftware. The transaction closed and the funds were received by Riverstone in June 2004, and will be reported in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended August 28, 2004. Riverstone has not yet assessed the impact on the\ncarrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities that would be included as a part of this disposal group; however, the total assets associated with this sale will not exceed the $8.8 million in unamortized intangible costs related to\nthis technology and $0.2 million in net inventory carried on Riverstone\x92s financial statements at the date of the sale.

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the\nEffective Time and held by a holder who has not voted or consented to the Merger in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such Company Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (and, if the Company is subject to Section 2115 of the\nCalifornia Corporations Code, such rights as may be granted to such persons in Chapter 13 of the California Corporations Code) shall not be converted into a right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration. Each such holder shall\nbe entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of Company Stock held by such holder in accordance with the DGCL (and, if the Company is subject to Section 2115 of the California Corporations Code, such rights as may be granted\nto such persons in Chapter 13 of the California Corporations Code), unless and until such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such holder\x92s right to appraisal.
