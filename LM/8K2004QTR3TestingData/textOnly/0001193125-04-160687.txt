(NASDAQ: CMRO), a leading provider of wireless test solutions, wireless emergency call box systems, and\nChargeSource mobile power products for notebook computers, cellular telephones, and other handheld devices, today reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 ended July 31, 2004. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 was $6.7 million, compared with $5.3 million\nfor the corresponding quarter of the prior fiscal year. Wireless test solutions (\x93WTS\x94) revenue totaled $3.5 million, up $1.3 million from the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Wireless applications revenue, which includes both ChargeSource\nmobile power products and call box systems, totaled $3.1 million and was up $0.1 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2004. ChargeSource revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 was $1.1 million, a decrease of $0.2 million in\ncomparison to the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Call box revenue totaled $2.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2005, a $0.3 million increase in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal 2004. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Revenue for the six months ended July 31, 2004 was $15.7 million compared with $11.5 million\nfor the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The net loss for the\nsecond quarter of fiscal 2005 was $5.0 million or $0.68 per share. Net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 included a $3.3 million charge, or $0.45 per share, to fully reserve the deferred tax asset as of July 31, 2004. Excluding such charge,\nnet loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 was $1.7 million, or $0.23 per share. The net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 was $2.3 million, or $0.32 per share. Net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 was impacted by\napproximately $1.9 million in legal, settlement, and related costs. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x93While our financial performance during the second quarter suffered from a week launch by our major ChargeSource distributor, we believe we have taken a major step towards improving the sales of this product category through the\nsigning of a distribution agreement with a new tier one distributor,\x94 said Tom Franza. \x93We anticipate shipping ChargeSource product to this new partner late in the fourth quarter. We are also aggressively pursuing distribution agreements\nwith several major OEMs. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x93Although our Seven.Five product platform\nachieved year-over-year revenue gains during the quarter, we fell a bit short of our quarterly sales target as a result of the delayed transition to 3G-based technology,\x94 continued Mr. Franza. \x93Due to various WCDMA development issues\nincluding software deficiencies and handset/base station incompatibilities, many wireless operators have postponed the launch of their WCDMA networks. However, we are seeing evidence that operators are beginning to deploy these networks; at the\nbeginning of 2004 there were approximately 16 commercial WCDMA networks and by the end of the year we estimate that there will be nearly 60 that have been deployed.

Our new\nscanner products offer high speed, accurate scanning capabilities for all major cellular technologies from 2G to 3G and the cellular radiophone markets. We also began shipping the first product in our family of handheld analyzers which will allow\nusers to troubleshoot and optimize WiFi networks with little or no radio frequency expertise. We continue to focus on bringing to market best-in-class technology that will allow us to expand our position as the gold standard in wireless test\nsolutions,\x94 said Mr. Franza. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Revenue for the six months ended July 31,\n2004 was $15.7 million, compared with $11.5 million for the same period last year. Net loss was $5.7 million, or $0.78 per share compared with a net loss of $3.1 million or $0.44 per share for the six months ended July 31, 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Business Outlook ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Despite the second quarter WTS revenue shortfall, we continue to expect WTS revenue to range between $8.0 million and $9.0 million for the\nsecond half of fiscal 2005 and be approximately $20.0 million for fiscal 2006. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'With the signing of a new tier one distributor, the Company expects ChargeSource product sales to ramp-up starting late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 with revenue to range between $3.0 million and $4.0 million for the six months\nending January 31, 2005. For fiscal 2006, ChargeSource revenue is expected to be approximately $20.0 million. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Sales from the call box systems are expected to generate approximately $7.0 million to $8.0 million in revenue for fiscal 2005. This projected increase is a result of increased expenditures from various local\ngovernments on small upgrade projects and new installations. Driven by increasing demand for digital upgrades to existing call box systems, call box revenue for fiscal 2006 is expected to total approximately $10.0 million. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Throughout fiscal 2005, the Company expects to continue to effectively manage its balance\nsheet, which currently includes approximately $13.8 million or $1.88 per share in cash.

The net effect\nof the restatement adjustments increased the Company\x92s second quarter net loss by $17,000 and increased the year to date net loss by $76,000. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company sold the net assets of EDX Engineering\n(\x93EDX\x94) and therefore the EDX operations have been reclassified as discontinued operations for fiscal 2004.

We initiated a design project aimed at\ndramatically reducing the cost and extending the competitive advantages of the ChargeSource product line. At about the same time, we started a transition to a high volume manufacturing facility in China.

As Doug mentioned, our Form 10-Q for the second quarter of fiscal \x9105 is on file with the SEC and available to the public. I\x92d\nlike to limit my comments then and simply highlight certain items related to our operations for the second quarter of fiscal 05 as well as the balance sheet as of the quarter end July 31, 2004.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'COMARCO INCORPORATED ', u' ', u'Moderator: Doug Sherk ', u' ', u'09-21-04/1:00 pm CT ', u' ', u'Confirmation #11006970 ', u' ', u' Page\n 7\n ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'As noted in today\x92s earnings release, for the second quarter of fiscal 2005, we took a $3.3 million charge or 45 cents per share to fully reserve the deferred tax asset. For the first\ntime in recent history, we have incurred accumulative losses excluding certain non-recurring items for a three-year period. This event was determined to be a significant element of negative evidence with respect to the recoverability of our net\ndeferred tax asset.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'While the Company expects to be profitable in the future, the projections of future profitability, as is the case with most forecasts, cannot be objectively verified.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Now with this in mind, the negative evidence of the three years of accumulative losses was considered to outweigh the positive evidence and we concluded that the net deferred tax asset should be\nfully reserved at the conclusion of the second quarter of fiscal \x9105. Now excluding this charge, our net loss for the second quarter was $1.7 million or approximately 23 cents per share.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Now as Tom mentioned, for the second quarter of fiscal \x9105, revenue from the sales of our WTS products fell slightly below our originally expectation and totaled $3.5 million. While below\nour original revenue expectation of approximately $4 million, WTS revenue increased $1.3 million in comparison to the second quarter of the prior fiscal year.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'The second quarter WTS revenue included approximately $1.9 million, attributable to SwissQual sales, which are our sales and support partner in Europe; additionally, we entered the third quarter\nof fiscal \x9105 with $2.3', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'COMARCO INCORPORATED ', u' ', u'Moderator: Doug Sherk ', u' ', u'09-21-04/1:00 pm CT ', u' ', u'Confirmation #11006970 ', u' ', u' Page\n 8\n ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'million in deferred SwissQual sales which we expect to revenue as collections are made. As of today, approximately a half a million dollars has already been collected against these amounts\nowed.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Looking forward, we continue to expect WTS revenue to range between $8 million and $9 million for the second half of fiscal \x9105. As in the past, the timing of receiving and delivering on\npurchase orders as well as the size of certain anticipated orders for WTS products tends to fluctuate quarter to quarter and could impact any one quarter positively or negatively.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Sales of our call box systems and related maintenance services generated revenue totaling $2 million for the second quarter of fiscal \x9105, an increase of approximately $300,000 compared to\nthe second quarter of the prior fiscal year. On a sequential basis, call box revenue increased approximately $400,000 compared to the first quarter of the current fiscal year. And as with our WTS product line, orders and delivers of call box\nproducts tend to fluctuate quarter to quarter.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'However, as indicated in today\x92s earnings release, we expect call box revenue for fiscal \x9105 to range between $7 and $8 million or between $3.4 and $4.4 million for the second half of\nfiscal \x9105. This revenue outlook has improved slightly from the prior quarter.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'As Tom mentioned, ChargeSource revenue totaled $1.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 with Targus as the significant customer. I\x92d like to note that the majority of Targus\nrevenue for fiscal \x9105 has been or will be generated as we meet our remaining obligations to Targus.

That quarter - that being the first quarter of fiscal \x9105 included a $400,000 charge related to the settlement of a dispute with the national wireless carrier based in Latin America. Excluding this charge, SG&A for the first\nquarter of fiscal \x9105 is approximately $2.2 million.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Accordingly, our actual quarterly run rate, excluding the non-recurring item for selling, general, and administrative costs for the first half of fiscal \x9105 was between $2 and $2.2 million\nper quarter.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Engineering and support costs for the second quarter of fiscal \x9105 totaled $1.9 million.

Tom, I guess the main thing I\x92d like to know is just a clarification to whatever extent you can with the new tier one distributor versus the Belkin\ndistributor. Does Belkin drop out? Do we have two distributors? Do they have focuses on different markets? Are they competing with each other? What\x92s supposed to happen there?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'COMARCO INCORPORATED ', u' ', u'Moderator: Doug Sherk ', u' ', u'09-21-04/1:00 pm CT ', u' ', u'Confirmation #11006970 ', u' ', u' Page\n 12\n ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Tom Franza:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'I think to make a long story short, I think we would expect that Belkin would drop out and the new tier one would become the dominant distributor for the retail channels.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Larry Lytton:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'And why - while Belkin was obviously very carefully selected, I believe they were, they may have very good credentials, why do you believe we\x92d be any more successful with our new\ndistributor? What are they going to do differently that\x92s going to allow them to penetrate any more than Belkin could?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Tom Franza:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Actually - you\x92re correct. Belkin has an excellent reputation; it\x92s a very strong Company, a very, very large distributor. Probably a very significant difference between Belkin and\nthe new selected distributor is that Belkin did not have an existing position in this category in the retail channels that are critical. And they needed to win that position and they couldn\x92t win that position in the timeframe that was\nrequired, which was the reason we made the change.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'The new distributor is already positioned in the retail channel with this product line and does not have to go out and win this from a cold start. That\x92s the primary\ndifference.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Larry Lytton:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Will we be exclusive to them or they will have multiple sources?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Tom Franza:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'It\x92s, in general, a non-exclusive agreement between the parties. There are provisions though that we will not create channel conflicts. So again, in the retail channels that this\ndistributor is strong in, we will make sure that we do nothing to create any kind of a channel conflict.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'COMARCO INCORPORATED ', u' ', u'Moderator: Doug Sherk ', u' ', u'09-21-04/1:00 pm CT ', u' ', u'Confirmation #11006970 ', u' ', u' Page\n 13\n ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Larry Lytton:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'But I\x92m thinking the other way. Why are they going to hang our product on their pegs if they have someone else\x92s products on the pegs?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Tom Franza:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'The reason that they want to move to our product is because of the inherent competitive advantage of our product over the other products, although other - at least one other Company can make\nprogrammable power adapters, we\x92re the only Company that can make these programmable power adapters that are very high power and very small size and weight.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'And that the new distributor feels is a form of a competitive advantage that would allow them to become the only distributor in the retail channels. And that was their reason for making this\nmove.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Larry Lytton:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'And then lastly, can you say what share of the category you have maybe in the big box retailers roughly?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Tom Franza:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'We probably - it\x92s pretty difficult right now because actually in the big box retailers, both - well Targus is continuing to sell our product as they unwind inventory and as we continue\nto fulfill some legacy contracts that we have with them so they\x92re still selling our product. That\x92s going to end soon. And the new tier one will start to pick it up.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'So it\x92s probably a bad time to make the measurement right now.

Our next question is from Neal Bradsher with Broadwood Capital. Please go ahead.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Neal Bradsher:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Yeah, a lot of my questions have been answered also. But just to clarify a little bit more, you mentioned that shipments to the new distributor will begin in December and I think I heard you\nsay that there are some minimums involved. Can you expand on that? Are we going to be pretty quickly at a full shipment pace or is it going to scale up over a period of time?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'And also, with respect to minimums, Belkin, as I recall, had some minimums too so while Belkin obviously is in a position of not getting shelf space that would help them to fulfill those\nminimums, to what degree we have stronger protections in this contract that we had in the Belkin contract so that we can have higher confidence, in fact, the minimums will in fact be fulfilled?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Tom Franza:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'I didn\x92t mentioned minimums. What I did\x85', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Neal Bradsher:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'My mistake then.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Tom Franza:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'What I did mention is that the new distributor has issued a number of purchase orders\x85', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Neal Bradsher:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Ah, okay.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'COMARCO INCORPORATED ', u' ', u'Moderator: Doug Sherk ', u' ', u'09-21-04/1:00 pm CT ', u' ', u'Confirmation #11006970 ', u' ', u' Page\n 15\n ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Tom Franza:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'\x85to us that we are currently gearing up to fulfill. And the bulk of those shipments are going to begin in December.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'And again, the only way to succeed in these distribution arrangements is to end - to in the end get final customer sell-through. And the - we\x92re very, very confident with this\ndistributor; the fact that they\x92re already in position and with queue retail accounts is key. The fact that they\x92re highly motivated and they view this product line as possessing competitive advantage and are planning to attempt to\ndominate the big box retail channel with the product line and the product advantages makes perfect sense.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'And we have also redesigned our product line to be more competitive; not only is it more cost efficient starting in with the December shipments, but there will - that cost efficiency will\nenable a number of marketing initiatives that we believe will give us some competitive advantage in the channels.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'So there\x92s a lot of things coming together here and I think for that reason, we will have a better success rate than we had in the last one. I actually would go back to the Belkin and\nsay that was really an anomaly. I think that\x92s probably not the norm. I think we hit the, you know, the 1 in 100 failure there in that launch for whatever reasons and there are still questions in my mind as to, you know, why it didn\x92t work\nbut it didn\x92t work. But I don\x92t expect to see that this time around.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Neal Bradsher:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'So to go back to the first part of my question, having to do with the ramp, are the initial purchase orders large enough to indicate that you\x92ll pretty quickly be up to that $20 million\nrun rate beginning in December/January timeframe?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Tom Franza:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'The initial purchase orders are consistent with the forecast and the forecast is consistent with the $20 million year.

It will be a ramp and the ramp will be driven by final customer sell-through to the extent that the product succeeds, the distributor succeeds, and\nthe sell-through is good, you know, we\x92ll achieve the sales.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'It\x92s - right now, it\x92s the best estimate available. It\x92s been worked very hard by a lot of people. It seems rational and believable; of course, you\x92ve got to, you know,\nyou\x92ve got to wait and see what reality is. But this is the best that we can come up with right now. It seems reasonable.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Neal Bradsher:', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Okay. Then you also mentioned in your release that you\x92re aggressively pursuing distribution agreements with several major OEMs. Could you talk about that a bit?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Tom Franza:', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'I can talk about it a little bit. We\x92re - we are working with a very major OEM. We\x92re in the qualification process for a private label opportunity, which could be quite large. And\nit\x92s not a done deal yet and it may not become a done deal but we are pretty optimistic. All the signs currently are quite positive.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'If in fact it did happen and if in fact some of the forecasts are even remotely believable, then we might come back in a few quarters and revise our guidance in a positive way because our\nguidance does not include any very, very large OEM hits, it does include some normal, modest, more in the third-party option category but it does include any private label in the box kind of forecast. So if that were to happen, we would probably\nhave a positive change in guidance for revenue.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Neal Bradsher:', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Okay. And then in your presentation earlier, you referred to some numbers that weren\x92t in the press release, having to do with expectation of positive cash flow of $5 to $6 million in\nfiscal \x9106. And that, I assume, it ties to the $50 million in revenue number and it looks relevant to me.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'COMARCO INCORPORATED ', u' ', u'Moderator: Doug Sherk ', u' ', u'09-21-04/1:00 pm CT ', u' ', u'Confirmation #11006970 ', u' ', u' Page\n 17\n ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'But I wonder if you could just say what your definition of cash flow is in that case? Are you talking about before working capital needs? Are the emphasis here on the difference between cash\nflow and earnings is on the fact that you\x92re carrying this big amortization not of prior capitalized software?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Tom Franza:', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'In this definition, it includes working capital. So there\x92s going to be an up-tick in working capital as we ramp upward in ChargeSource primarily but even in call box which is going to\nhave a significant upward ramp. And that\x92s all included in the cash flow projections.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Neal Bradsher:', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'So it\x92s $5 to $6 million net of the need for working capital or some of the $5 to $6 million will go into working capital?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Tom Franza:', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Net of\x85', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Neal Bradsher:', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Okay. So working capital will go up and your cash balance would go up $5 or $6 million?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Tom Franza:', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'That\x92s correct.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Neal Bradsher:', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Okay.

Please go ahead with your question.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Alan Parsow:', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'My - I have two questions. First was in regard to the deferred tax asset that we\x92ve now wiped off. I\x92m assuming that we can recover that\x85?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Tom Franza:', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'That\x92s correct.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Alan Parsow:', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x85if it\x92s - okay, fine. That\x92s the first question. The second one is based on your outlook for the free cash flow and your earnings performance next year, even on a conservative\nbasis, it seems to me that that should allow you to, if you want, go into the market and repurchase some of your shares for retirement and/or to offset dilution from options, etc. Has the Board looked into this? Are they considering this in a\nserious way now?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Tom Franza:', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Well, we have a repurchase program that is active. The Board generally supports those activities. We are being a little bit conservative with the cash here as we get through the next couple\nof quarters and we stabilize the ChargeSource business and we get a - want to get a sense of the ramp on our working capital projection that\x92s in that cash flow number, just is based on the $20 million guidance.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'COMARCO INCORPORATED ', u' ', u'Moderator: Doug Sherk ', u' ', u'09-21-04/1:00 pm CT ', u' ', u'Confirmation #11006970 ', u' ', u' Page\n 19\n ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'As we said, if something happens on the OEM side, which quite frankly, is more than just a glimmer at this point, then we would probably have to revisit our needs for working capital, etc.,\nbased on that happening.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'So I think making a real long answer, I think we\x92re going to be a little bit cautious with the cash for the next few months until we get a real good solid understanding of what our cash\nneeds might be. If, in the next few months, we think it\x92s going to - this guidance that we\x92ve given today is going to be it and it\x92s not going to be exceeded or have a shortfall, then certainly, buying the stock back, particularly if\nthe current levels starts to look, you know, quite attractive.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Alan Parsow:', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Well, yeah, clearly, but also, I mean based on your - the lack of leverage on your balance sheet, it seems to me that you have plenty of room outside of your cash to do that.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Tom Franza:', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'I think we probably do but I think we want to just make sure that we get stable and we\x92re well on the road to, you know, having success.

I think, from what I can see from your Q, you have about a very small amount of shares remaining; I\nthink about 400,000.

I don\x92t - I think I fall back to my prior answer, I think before we would change the current program, we\x92d want to get a better view of what\x92s going to happen over the\nnext couple of quarters. There\x92s a lot of things changing right now in our lives and we just would want to get more visibility before we change the program.

Touching on the OEM (SU) with the ChargeSource product, you know, just from our own homework, I mean we\x92ve noticed that Dell has, you know, a product out there, a Targus adapter,\nbut it\x92s completely - it\x92s not compatible at all with the notebooks areas of Dell.

And there are a smattering of smaller subprojects in other counties but those\nare the two big ones. About 5,000 out of the 19,000 or 20,000 install base.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'There is a law, it\x92s pretty well - every - all the safes, which are the owners of call box systems, pretty well accept the fact that they have to provide full access to handicap people\nand hearing-impaired, speech-impaired people. Not all of them have felt ready to go ahead with these upgrades. Some of them are thinking that they can\x92t afford the upgrade. Others are trying to decide what form the upgrade should take;\nthere\x92s more than one flavor of TTY.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'So there\x92s a fair amount of fixing to do these things but I think we\x92re going to see certainly the big counties go forward and do this and the big cities, perhaps New York City,\nwould also go ahead and do something like this. I think they seem to be more sensitive to some of these issues than some of the smaller counties that have less money and maybe have an affordability issue.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Andrew Sole:', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Okay. And just one last question and then I\x92ll let you guys go. With respect to the conversion of TTY, is there a statutory deadline for them to be - to comply with the ADA requirements\nregardless of - I mean ADA is a Federal Law so even this, you know, the various jurisdictions, do they have to comply by a certain date?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Tom Franza:', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'There\x92s not a date. There is what is what - the way the process works is the ADA pressure groups typically will file a lawsuit, get into the court process, and then through that process,\nthe judge will fix a date and that will happen on an honor by honor basis if the owners don\x92t preempt that by going ahead and doing it.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'COMARCO INCORPORATED ', u' ', u'Moderator: Doug Sherk ', u' ', u'09-21-04/1:00 pm CT ', u' ', u'Confirmation #11006970 ', u' ', u' Page\n 24\n ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Andrew Sole:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Okay.

Our next question is from Harris Cohen with Gata Fund.

On the Wi-Fi product separately and then also with the handheld analyzer, can you speak to the market take-up? What do sales look like; backlog? And then separately, how\ndoes the margin right now, and given that it\x92s a new product, of course, how does the margin on those products compare to the average of that segment?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Tom Franza:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Yeah. The - one point of clarification, the Wi-Fi product and the handheld I think are really the same thing. The Wi-Fi analyzer runs on a pocket PC platform so I think you\x92re probably\nreferring to the same thing there.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'I pointed out on - in the last quarter that the Wi-Fi analyzer is not so much - we don\x92t really see that as so much as a large revenue opportunity as we do as a foot in the door to\nunderstanding Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi optimization and Wi-Fi interference issues because we are seeing signs from our cellular customers that there\x92s going to be a convergence of Wi-Fi and conventional cellular.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'COMARCO INCORPORATED ', u' ', u'Moderator: Doug Sherk ', u' ', u'09-21-04/1:00 pm CT ', u' ', u'Confirmation #11006970 ', u' ', u' Page\n 25\n ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'And we want to make sure that we\x92re positioned in the marketplace and we\x92re positioned with technology so that we can embed Wi-Fi analyzer capabilities in the Seven.Five platform if\nand when the time comes. We have just started selling the analyzer and we have small numbers of orders but I would not call them significant at this point yet.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Harris Cohen:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Okay. A second question is with Nextel and their swapping of Spectrum that\x92s going on with the SEC and the whole legal system, if that were to occur, does that have a positive effect on\nus?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Tom Franza:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'It would have a couple of effects on us. One effect is we would have to change our software so we can support the new bands that they\x92re swapping into. And whether or not that would\ncreate a demand for more systems is kind of problematic at this point. I\x92m not\x97I don\x92t know the answer to that yet.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Harris Cohen:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Okay. Thank you.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Operator:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Thank you. And our next question is from Larry Lytton with Second Line Capital Management. Please go ahead with your follow-up question.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Larry Lytton:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Thanks. Well, a couple of follow-ups. Is there going to be a simulation period for Belkin inventory the same way there\x92s Targus inventory? Is the Belkin branded product that has to -\nsomething has to happen with?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Tom Franza:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Yes, to an extent. Belkin has a product that they have been selling. They haven\x92t been selling it in the mainstream retail channel but they\x92ve been selling it in a number of the\nother channels. And that will ramp down naturally over time. And I don\x92t think that will - that won\x92t become a confusion factor at all.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'COMARCO INCORPORATED ', u' ', u'Moderator: Doug Sherk ', u' ', u'09-21-04/1:00 pm CT ', u' ', u'Confirmation #11006970 ', u' ', u' Page\n 26\n ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Larry Lytton:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Okay. And in terms of the new tier one versus Belkin with, is the new tier one embedded at the same time Belkin was or for some reason, we hadn\x92t talked to them or they weren\x92t\navailable previously?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Tom Franza:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'They weren\x92t available at the time. The Belkin initiative really started in August a year ago and at that time that other option did not exist. And we got engaged with\nBelkin.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'And quite frankly, as we went through the process for several months, I think on both sides, both Belkin and Comarco, it seemed like a good idea to do it and it seemed like it would work; it\ndidn\x92t. And once we recognized that, we went back out into the world and started talking to people and it turned out that conditions on the other side had changed as well. So it was a - it was good timing.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'And I think now we have a very, very good marriage of provider and distributor.

And then in - either quantitatively or qualitatively, if you look at \x9106 and that cash flow, do you expect all the quarters to be positive cash flow?

Do you anticipate that the ChargeSource products will continue to have the same retail prices in light of the cost reduction efforts that your - that you\x92ve\nundertaken?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Tom Franza:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Yes.
