Highlights included the following:\n\n      -     Loan fundings were $31 billion for the month, an increase of 5\n            percent from the prior month. This represents a 24 percent decline\n            from August 2003 as a result of a substantially lower level of\n            industry-wide refinance activity. Year-to-date funding volume now\n            totals $237 billion.\n\n      -     Monthly purchase activity rose for the sixth consecutive month to\n            $18 billion, an increase of 1 percent over last month and 42 percent\n            more than August 2003. Year-to-date purchase volume now stands at\n            $113 billion, approaching 2003's full year level of $130 billion.\n\n      -     Demand for adjustable-rate, home equity and subprime loans remained\n            robust.\n\n            -     Adjustable-rate fundings reached a record $18 billion, 83\n                  percent greater than August 2003, and accounted for 59 percent\n                  of total monthly loan volume. Adjustable-rate volume grew by 7\n                  percent over July 2004, driving year-to-date volume to $118\n                  billion.\n\n            -     Home equity fundings reached a new monthly record of $3.1\n                  billion, 8 percent more than the previous month and 80 percent\n                  higher than August 2003. Year-to-date home equity production\n                  surpassed $18 billion, and exceeded the volume achieved in\n                  calendar 2003.\n\n            -     Subprime volume grew for the month to $4.3 billion, advancing\n                  13 percent from last month and increasing 158 percent over\n                  August 2003. Year-to-date subprime volume totaled $25 billion,\n                  exceeding total subprime volume produced in calendar 2003.\n\n\n                                     (more)\n", u'\n2-2-2\n\n      -     The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield declined during the month of August\n            2004, as compared to a rising trend in August 2003. As a result,\n            average daily application activity during August 2004 rose by 2\n            percent over July 2004 and was 13 percent more than August 2003. And\n            while the pipeline of applications-in-process at August 31, 2004 was\n            down 7 percent from August 31, 2003, it was 4 percent greater than\n            July 2004.\n\n      -     The servicing portfolio reached $765 billion for the month,\n            surpassing the August 2003 level by $173 billion, or 29 percent, and\n            has increased by $120 billion since the beginning of 2004.\n\n      -     August securities trading volume of $241 billion decreased by 6\n            percent from the level achieved in August 2003 primarily due to\n            lower mortgage origination activity industry-wide. Year-to-date\n            trading volume totaled $2.1 trillion, 2 percent greater than the\n            $2.0 trillion achieved for the same 8-month period of 2003.\n\n      -     Total assets at Countrywide Bank rose to $31 billion, 8 percent\n            higher than July 2004 and double the level of August 2003.\n\n      -     Net earned premiums at Balboa were $64 million, down 3 percent from\n            August 2003 as a result of lower activity in Balboa Life & Casualty,\n            and year-to-date reached $514 million.\n\n      -     Sub-servicing volume at Global Home Loans totaled $109 billion, a 17\n            percent increase from August 2003.\n\n"Countrywide\'s well-balanced business model continues to produce strong\noperational results amidst a transitional environment," said Stanford L.\nKurland, President and Chief Operating Officer. "Compared to a year ago, the\ntotal mortgage origination market is smaller as a result of lower refinance\nvolume. This impact has been mitigated by Countrywide\'s dramatic growth in\npurchase fundings and record volumes of adjustable-rate, home equity and\nsubprime loans. On the servicing side, our portfolio grew $18 billion from July\n2004 to reach a new high of $765 billion, as we set our sights on becoming the\nindustry\'s #1 servicer. The Company\'s servicing portfolio has grown 19 percent\nsince the beginning of the year and 29 percent over the last twelve months.\nCountrywide\'s diversification efforts were led by Countrywide Bank. The Bank\'s\nassets have doubled over the last year to $31 billion, on track with our growth\nplan."\n\n                                     (more)\n', u'\n3-3-3\n\nFounded in 1969, Countrywide Financial Corporation is a member of the S&P 500,\nForbes 2000 and Fortune 500.
