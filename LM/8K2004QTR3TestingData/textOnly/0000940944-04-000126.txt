"Despite the adverse effects\nof Hurricane Charley and the Summer Olympics, we achieved solid earnings growth.\nOlive Garden continues to perform well, Red Lobster and Bahama Breeze are making\nprogress in important areas and Smokey Bones continues its successful expansion.\nWe\'re  focused on sustained  brilliance  with the basics.  That means  providing\noutstanding  service,  great tasting food and a clean,  comfortable and inviting\natmosphere  in  our  restaurants.   We  know  operating  excellence  and  strong\nleadership teams are what it takes to be the best in casual dining."\n\nHighlights for the quarter ended August 29, 2004, include the following:\n\no    Net  earnings  in the first  quarter  were $72.1  million,  or 44 cents per\n     diluted  share,  on sales of $1.28  billion.  Last year,  net earnings were\n     $68.6 million, or 40 cents per diluted share, on sales of $1.26 billion.\n\no    Total sales of $1.28 billion represent a 1.5% increase over prior year.\n\no    Olive Garden reported its 40th consecutive quarter of U.S.  same-restaurant\n     sales growth with a 2.8% increase.\n\no    On August 11, the Company  announced  that Clarence Otis, Jr. would succeed\n     Joe Lee as Darden\'s  CEO in December  2004.  Lee will remain as Chairman of\n     the Board  until his planned  retirement  in  December  2005,  when Otis is\n     expected to become Chairman.\n\no    The Company also announced that Drew Madsen, now President of Olive Garden,\n     will become  Darden\'s  President  and Chief  Operating  Officer in December\n     2004.\n\n                                     -MORE-\n', u'\n\n                                       -2-\n\no    The Company continued its share repurchases, buying back 2.9 million shares\n     of its common stock in the quarter.\n\nOperating Highlights\n\nOLIVE GARDEN\'S first quarter sales of $580.5 million were 6.0% above prior year,\ndriven by revenue from 18 net new restaurants in operation  versus last year and\na U.S.  same-restaurant  sales  increase of 2.8%.  This is the 40th  consecutive\nquarter of  same-restaurant  sales  growth for Olive Garden and builds on a 3.9%\nincrease  in the first  quarter of last year.  The  company\'s  increased  sales,\ncombined with lower restaurant expenses and selling,  general and administrative\nexpenses as a  percentage  of sales,  more than offset  increased  labor  costs,\nresulting  in  a  record   quarterly   profit  that  also  represents  a  strong\ndouble-digit operating profit increase over last year.\n\n"This was a strong  quarter for Olive  Garden,"  said Drew Madsen,  President of\nOlive Garden. "Our financial results in the areas of operating profit and return\non sales were outstanding.  We\'ve delivered 10 straight years of same-restaurant\nsales growth, and our goal is to deliver that kind of sustained  excellence well\ninto the  future.  To  accomplish  that,  our teams  will  continue  to focus on\ndelighting our guests with a genuine Italian dining experience."\n\nRED LOBSTER\'S  first quarter sales of $594.8 million were 6.2% below prior year,\nreflecting  a U.S.  same-restaurant  sales  decrease of 7.6% that was  partially\noffset by revenue  from an  additional  five net new  restaurants  in  operation\nversus last year.  Profit margins per guest improved,  as this year\'s lower food\nand beverage costs and  restaurant  expenses more than offset higher labor costs\nand  selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  as a  percent  of  sales.\nOperating profits were slightly lower than last year, as expected.\n\n"Red  Lobster\'s new `Simply Great\'  operational  discipline is having a positive\nimpact," said Kim Lopdrup,  President of Red Lobster.  "We achieved record guest\nsatisfaction scores during the quarter. We also earned higher profit margins per\nguest because of greater  efficiencies and reduced waste.  While we have a great\ndeal more work to do,  we are  pleased  that the  operating  performance  of our\nrestaurants  is  improving  rapidly.  I am also  delighted  with how quickly our\nsenior leaders have become an effective team."\n\nBAHAMA  BREEZE  continued  to deliver  strong sales  improvement,  driven by the\naddition  of the  lunch  daypart  in most of the  restaurants  and in  spite  of\noperating two fewer restaurants than in the first quarter of the prior year.\n\nSMOKEY BONES operated 32 more restaurants  than the prior year,  including seven\nrestaurants that were opened during the first quarter. For the full fiscal year,\n30 to 40 new restaurants are expected to open.\n\nOther Actions\n\nDarden continued the buyback of its common stock,  purchasing 2.9 million shares\nin the first quarter.  Since commencing its share  repurchases in December 1995,\nthe Company has repurchased a total of 112.2 million shares under authorizations\ntotaling 115.4 million shares.\n\n', u"\n\n\n                                     -MORE-\n                                       -3-\n\nAugust 2004 U.S. Same-Restaurant Sales Results\n\nDarden  reported  same-restaurant  sales for the  four-week  fiscal August ended\nAugust 29,  2004.  This period is the last month of  Darden's  fiscal 2005 first\nquarter.\n\nSame-restaurant  sales at Olive  Garden were down 2% to 3% for fiscal  August as\nexpected,  impacted by the company's  decision not to advertise during the final\ntwo weeks of the month  during the  Olympics.  The decline  reflected a 5% to 6%\ndecrease in guest  counts and a 2% to 3% increase  in check  average.  The check\naverage  increase  was a result of a 2% to 3% increase in pricing and a 0% to 1%\nincrease from menu mix changes.  Last year,  Olive Garden had an  approximate 6%\nincrease in  same-restaurant  sales during fiscal August.  The company estimates\nthat the 2004 Summer Olympics in August and the decision not to advertise during\nthe  final  two  weeks  of  fiscal  August  adversely  affected  Olive  Garden's\nsame-restaurant sales by approximately 2% to 3%.\n\nHeavily  affected  by a shift in  promotional  strategy  compared  to last year,\nsame-restaurant  sales at Red  Lobster  were down  approximately  16% for fiscal\nAugust.  This  reflected  a 14% to 15%  decline  in guest  counts and a 1% to 2%\ndecline  in  check  average.   The  check  average  decrease  was  a  result  of\napproximately  a 0% to 1% increase  in pricing and a 1% to 2% decline  from menu\nmix   changes.   Last  year,   Red  Lobster  had  an  11%  to  12%  increase  in\nsame-restaurant sales during fiscal August.\n\nThe Company estimates that Hurricane  Charley,  which occurred in fiscal August,\nadversely affected August  same-restaurant sales results at both Red Lobster and\nOlive Garden by approximately 0.5% for a total sales impact at Darden of $1.5 to\n$2.0 million.\n\nDarden Restaurants,  Inc.,  headquartered in Orlando, FL, owns and operates over\n1,300 Red Lobster,  Olive  Garden,  Bahama  Breeze,  Smokey Bones and Seasons 52\nrestaurants with annual sales of $5.0 billion.\n\n\nForward-looking statements in this news release, if any, are made under the Safe\nHarbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995.\nCertain  important
