The\nCompany has also separately announced today certain preliminary financial\ninformation concerning the previously unreported fourth quarter of 2003 and the\nfirst two quarters of 2004. In summary, the Company presently estimates that\nthere will be adjustments to previously reported results for 2001, 2002 and the\nfirst nine months of 2003 in the following estimated amounts: for 2001, the\nCompany\'s reported loss before income taxes was overstated and operating profit\nwas understated by approximately $1 million in each case; for 2002, the\nCompany\'s reported loss before income taxes was understated and operating profit\nwas overstated by approximately $5 million in each case; and, for the first nine\nmonths of 2003, the Company\'s reported loss before income taxes was understated\nby approximately $3 million and operating profit was overstated by less than $1\nmillion. The restatement will also affect periods prior to 2001. In addition,\nthere is expected to be an adjustment to increase goodwill by approximately $18\nmillion as of the November 2000 acquisition date of the Company. Review of all\nrestatement adjustments is ongoing.\n\n     The restatement arose primarily out of information obtained through the\ninvestigation conducted by an independent director of the Company, Marshall\nCohen, with the assistance of an independent counsel, Sidley Austin Brown & Wood\nLLP, and the forensic accounting group of Deloitte & Touche LLP. The\ninvestigation was initiated as a result of certain allegations made by an\nemployee of the Company and information obtained by the Company\'s internal audit\nstaff. As discussed below, the Company has implemented, or adopted plans to\nimplement, a number of measures intended to address matters of concern that have\nbeen identified through the investigation and is continuing to consider further\nmeasures.\n\n     In 2003, a new plant controller at the Sintered division\'s St. Mary\'s,\nPennsylvania facility encountered difficulties in understanding certain\naccounting practices and documentation. In December 2003, he notified the\nCompany\'s independent auditors, KPMG LLP, that, among other things, he was\nunable to reconcile certain of the plant\'s general ledger accounts and to find\nappropriate documentation for certain entries and indicated that he had concerns\nregarding the division controller. The Company\'s Chief Financial Officer\ninitiated an immediate review by the Company\'s internal audit department of\naccounting procedures and financial accounting at the domestic plants within the\nSintered division. Shortly thereafter, the Company and its Board of Directors\nauthorized the independent investigation into certain accounting practices at\nthe Sintered division from 2001 through 2003.\n\n     During the initial stages of the investigation, the Company was made aware\nof errors with respect to the recording of certain entries which it attempted to\nanalyze. While the\n\n', u'\n\n\nCompany was performing these analyses, in February 2004, the Sintered division\ncontroller made the following allegations concerning actions in which he\nadmittedly participated. He alleged that, following the acquisition of the\nCompany in November 2000, income at the Sintered division from 2000 through 2003\nwas deliberately understated by up to approximately $10 million in the\naggregate. He alleged that these understatements were part of an effort to\ndisguise previous overstatements of income by approximately $20 million in\naggregate at the Sintered division during the period from 1996 through 1999,\nwhich was prior to the acquisition. There were three primary allegations from\nthe former Sintered divisional controller related to the period 1996 to 1999.\nDuring this time, he stated income was overstated by (1) overstating fixed\nassets, (2) understating liabilities (notably accounts payable), and (3) using a\ncomplex set of manual journal entries every month to "disguise" the effects of\n(1) and (2). Following the acquisition in late 2000, he stated that income was\nunderstated through similar actions. The Company has concluded that the Sintered\ndivision controller\'s allegations concerning these actions were correct,\nalthough the amounts impacted by the actions vary from the allegations as\nreflected in the information released by the Company today. The Sintered\ndivision investigation revealed deficiencies, circumventions and breakdowns that\noccurred in controls and procedures at the Company. As a result of these and\nother investigated matters, to date, seven accounting or operations personnel\nare no longer employed by the Company.\n\n     Based upon certain findings within the Sintered division, the investigation\nwas expanded to encompass accounting practices in other areas of the Company\nconcerning the use of reserves and accrual accounts and the recognition of\ntooling income for the period from 2001 through 2003. This investigation\ninvolved an extensive review by those conducting the investigation of journal\nentries of over a specified amount made over a three year period. As a result of\nthe expanded investigation, the Company became aware of instances of\ninappropriate accounting relating to reserves and accruals, which had the effect\nof "smoothing" earnings for certain periods. Specifically, the Company has\nconcluded from the investigative findings that certain plant controllers had\ninappropriately maintained reserves to cover unanticipated expenses, increased\nor decreased reserves based upon performance, and/or recorded accruals or\nreserves different from estimated or analyzed amounts. The Company has also\nidentified from the investigative findings a few instances of incorrect timing\nin the recognition of tooling income. The investigation categorized journal\nentries from the relevant periods for analysis by the Company and review by the\nCompany with its current and former independent auditors. The Company analyzed\nthose categories of entries which the investigation determined to be either\npotentially inaccurate (i.e., warranting further review) or unknown (i.e.,\ninsufficient documentation for third party evaluation). Based upon the Company\'s\ninitial review of these categories of entries, the Company believes that the net\nimpact on pretax earnings of the entries determined to be inappropriate and the\ntooling income issue discussed above was less than $1 million in each of the\nyears of 2001, 2002 or 2003 and no quarter was affected by more than that\namount. Review of the journal entries by the Company with its current and former\nindependent auditors is ongoing and, consequently, there is the possibility of\nrestatement adjustments in amounts in excess of the impact described above.\n\n     Through the work of the investigation, a number of concerns with financial\ncontrols and procedures have been identified. Control concerns specifically\nidentified by those conducting the investigation include, but are not limited\nto, instances of disregard for, or lack of understanding of, proper accrual\naccounting under GAAP, particularly in relation to reserve accounts;\ninconsistent policies and procedures concerning the recognition of tooling\nincome; inadequate training of personnel within key accounting and operations\nfunctions; undue pressure\n\n                                      -2-\n\n', u"\n\non certain accounting personnel relative to operating results; issues in\nproperly reviewing internal reporting packages and questionnaires; a failure to\nproperly account for fixed assets; a lack of timely and adequate monitoring of\nintercompany balances, management review of general ledger, account\nreconciliation and manual journal entries; and insufficient information systems\nsafeguards and security controls. The Company understands that its current\nindependent auditors have identified certain concerns that give rise to material\nweaknesses and that its auditors will make business recommendations based upon\nthese and other concerns. Material weaknesses, if unaddressed, could result in\nmaterial errors in the Company's subsequent financial statements. The Company\nbelieves that certain of the issues highlighted by the investigation derive from\nthe Company's history of acquisitions and the attendant employment of personnel\nfrom different predecessor companies who continued prior accounting practices.\nIn some instances, the Company believes control issues have been exacerbated by\nthe predecessor companies' previously highly decentralized structure which\ncurrent management has been addressing over time since the acquisition.\n\n     The Company believes these issues to be serious and has devoted substantial\nresources to the improvement and review of its control processes and procedures\nand such review is ongoing. Those conducting the investigation have made\nobservations concerning corrective actions based on the matters that have come\nto their attention, which the Company has reviewed. The Company has taken\nactions or considered actions to address concerns and issues referred to above,\nand intends to continue taking actions as necessary to further address such\nconcerns and issues, by (1) making personnel and organizational changes; (2)\nimproving communications and internal reporting; (3) simplifying and making\nconsistent various accounting policies and procedures and enhancing related\ndocumentation; (4) significantly expanding its training programs for both\naccounting and non-accounting employees related to accounting matters; (5)\nincreasing management's focus on internal controls and improving the extent and\ntiming of management oversight in a number of areas; and (6) implementing\nprocesses and procedures to reduce manual interventions and adjustments and more\nappropriately limit access to certain files and systems. The Company's Audit\nCommittee and its Board of Directors have reviewed the actions undertaken to\ndate in response to the findings arising from the accounting investigation and\nauthorized other actions to improve control processes and procedures. The\nCompany will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of its controls and\nprocedures on an ongoing basis, including consideration of internal control\nweaknesses and business recommendations identified by its auditors and\nsuggestions made by those that conducted the investigation, and, consequently,\nintends to implement further actions in its continuing efforts to strengthen the\ncontrol process. In addition, the Company continues to implement previously\nidentified desirable improvements in its internal controls in preparation for\ncompliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\n     The Company is in the process of preparing the restatement and expects to\nmake appropriate filings with the Securities Exchange Commission of its restated\nresults and previously unfiled Securities Exchange Act reports as soon as\npracticable. The information being released by the Company today is subject to\nits continuing review, as well as all necessary review by its auditors and\nothers, and is subject to further change. In addition, prior to the announcement\nof the investigation, the Commission provided the Company with comments on its\nfilings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the ordinary course and the\nCompany expects to respond to the Staff concerning those comments prior to\nfiling definitive Forms 10-K and 10-Q's for the relevant periods. It is possible\nthat disclosure may change as a result of that review. In\n\n                                      -3-\n\n", u'\n\naddition, the Company is seeking relief from certain disclosure requirements in\nthe Form 10-K relating to pre-acquisition periods and the Company may be delayed\nin filing definitive documents pending receipt of that relief or if such relief\nis not obtained. As separately announced, the Company has undertaken to seek\nextensions of waivers from its senior credit facility lenders, receivables\nfinance providers and certain lessors relating to its delay in financial\nreporting.\n\nAbout Metaldyne\n\n     Metaldyne is a leading global designer and supplier of metal-based\ncomponents, assemblies and modules for the automotive industry.

In addition, the Company had approximately $37 million in\nadditional volume related to new product launches and ramp up of existing\nprograms as well as a $17 million benefit from foreign exchange movements.\nHowever, these increases were partially offset by approximately $32 million\nrelated to the divestiture of two aluminum die casting facilities within the\nCompany's Driveline segment, and a 2.9% decrease in North American vehicle\nproduction by the Company's three largest customers (Ford, General Motors and\nDaimlerChrysler).\n\n     The Company announced, on a preliminary basis, that its operating profit\nwas approximately $38 million, or 3.8% of net sales, for the first six months of\n2004 compared to $30 million, or 3.9% of net sales, for the same period in 2003.\nExcluding an $8 million asset impairment charge relating to a divestiture of two\naluminum die casting operations in the Company's Driveline segment, operating\nprofit would have been $46 million, or 4.6% of net sales. The increase in 2004\nis principally explained by a $14 million increase from the New Castle\nacquisition. These gains were partially offset by approximately $6 million in\nfees and expenses relating to the just completed accounting investigation.\n\n     The Company is facing significant increases in the cost to procure certain\nmaterials utilized in its manufacturing processes such as steel, energy,\nMolybdenum and nickel. In general, steel prices have recently risen by as much\nas 60-100% and have thus created significant tension between steel producers,\nsuppliers and end customers. Based on current prices, our steel costs could\nincrease approximately $50 million in 2004. However, the Company anticipates\nseveral initiatives such as steel scrap sales, steel resourcing efforts,\ncontractual steel surcharge pass through agreements with selected customers, and\nreducing or eliminating 2004 scheduled price downs to its customers will offset\napproximately $30 million of these increased costs. Additionally, the Company is\nactively working with its customers to 1) obtain additional business to help\noffset these prices through better utilization of its capacity, 2) negotiate a\nsurcharge to reflect the increased material costs, and/or 3) resource certain of\nits products made unprofitable by these increases in material costs. The Company\nwill actively work to mitigate the effect of these steel increases throughout\n2004.\n\n     The Company reported that its depreciation and amortization expense\nincreased from approximately $54 million in the first six months of 2003 to\napproximately $64 million in 2004. The net increase in depreciation and\namortization of approximately $10 million is principally explained by $9 million\nof depreciation and amortization expense associated with the New Castle\nacquisition. In addition, for the past several years capital spending has been\nin excess of depreciation expense. Accordingly, the additional capital spending\naccounts for the remaining increase in depreciation expense.\n\n     The Company incurred approximately $2 million of restructuring charges in\nthe first six months of 2004 versus a charge of approximately $4 million in the\nsame period in 2003. The 2004 charge is primarily related to restructuring\nactivities initiated in 2003 and costs associated with the closure of a\nDriveline segment facility located in Europe. In connection with the sale of two\naluminum die casting facilities, the Company incurred an $8 million charge in\nthe\n                                      -2-\n\n", u'\n\nfirst six months of 2004. In connection with the sale of these same two\nfacilities, the Company also recorded an impairment charge of $5 million in late\n2003 in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal\nof Long-Lived Assets." Subsequent to December 28, 2003, these two facilities\nwere sold to an independent third party. The sales price to this third party was\nused to determine the fair market value of the facilities for the SFAS No. 144\nimpairment analysis.\n\n     At June 27, 2004, the Company had approximately $861 million in debt\noutstanding and approximately $47 million outstanding on its accounts receivable\nsecuritization facility. At this date, the Company also had approximately $87\nmillion and $52 million of undrawn and available commitments from its revolving\ncredit facility and accounts receivable facility, respectively. At June 27,\n2004, the Company was contingently liable under standby letters of credit\ntotaling $61 million issued for the Company\'s behalf by financial institutions.\nThese letters of credit are used for a variety of purposes, including meeting\nrequirements to self-insure workers\' compensation claims.\n\n     The Company\'s senior credit facility contains various affirmative and\nnegative covenants, including a financial covenant requirement for an EBITDA to\ncash interest expense coverage ratio to exceed 2.25:1.00 through July 3, 2005;\nand a debt to EBITDA leverage ratio not to exceed 5.00 through June 27, 2004,\ndecreasing to 4.75:1.00 for the quarter ending October 3, 2004. The accounts\nreceivable facility balance is included in computing debt for the purposes of\nthese covenant calculations. The Company was in compliance with the preceding\nfinancial covenants at June 27, 2004 and, as previously announced, had\npreviously obtained waivers associated with its inability to submit financial\nstatements and associated representations and warranties through September 30,\n2004. As announced today by the Company, the Company is seeking to extend this\nwaiver pending completion of its restatement.\n\nPreliminary Full 2003 Results as Compared to Restated 2002 Results\n\n     The Company\'s preliminary results for the full year 2003 reflect certain\nanticipated restatement adjustments for the first three quarters of 2003 and\nother matters which remain under continuing review. In reviewing the information\nas compared with the restated 2002 results, it should be noted that information\nis not comparable due to the divestiture of the Company\'s former TriMas\nsubsidiary in June 2002. References to the Automotive Group below eliminate the\nresults of the TriMas subsidiary for 2002.\n\n     The Company\'s reported preliminary results for its Automotive Group\nincreased from $1,465 million in 2002 to approximately $1,508 million in 2003.\nDespite a 6.4% decrease in NAFTA production, sales increased $42 million, but\nwere essentially flat after adjusting for a $44 million impact of exchange rate\nmovement.\n\n     The Company reported operating profit was approximately $20 million for\n2003 compared to approximately $63 million in 2002 after excluding TriMas. The\n$43 million reduction in operating profit is the result of several factors,\nincluding approximately $30 million in non-cash charges relating to a $5 million\nasset impairment charge related to the aluminum die casting facilities noted\nabove, a $14 million in fixed asset disposals, and an $11 million increase in\ndepreciation and amortization. In addition, operating profit in 2003 was\nimpacted by an ap-\n\n                                      -3-\n\n', u"\n\nproximately $10 million increase in restructuring charges and a $7 million\nincrease in the cost to procure steel, the Company's largest raw material.\n\n     The Company's depreciation and amortization expense increased from\napproximately $96 million in 2002 to approximately $107 million in 2003 for its\nAutomotive Group. The net increase of approximately $11 million is due to\ndepreciation expense recorded on capital expenditures of approximately $130\nmillion for 2003 and $115 million for 2002. As discussed, the Company's higher\ncapital spending in recent years accounts for the increase in depreciation\nexpense. In 2003, the Company entered into several restructuring arrangements\nwhereby it incurred approximately $13 million of costs associated with severance\nand facility closure. In addition, as discussed, the Company recorded a $5\nmillion charge as a result of an impairment analysis relating to two plants with\nnegative operating performance.\n\nAnticipated Financial Restatement\n\n     The following table summarizes the Company's current estimates of the\nimpact of the anticipated restatement on the Company's operating profit and\nearnings before taxes for the years ended December 29, 2002 and December 31,\n2001 and the first nine months of 2003. The following table reflects the impact\nof the anticipated restatement adjustments on reported results, which includes\nTriMas through June 2002, however, none of the adjustments relate to TriMas. The\nadjustments relate solely to the Automotive Group.\n\n", u'\n', u'\n\n                    December 29, 2002 (includes TriMas results)         December 31, 2001 (includes TriMas results)\n                    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(in millions)              As        Restatements  As Restated      As Previously    Restatements   As Restated\n                       Previously    Adjustments                       Reported      Adjustments\n                        Reported\n\n', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u'\nOperating Profit          $114           $(5)         $109               $127             $1            $128\nLoss Before Taxes         $(64)          $(5)         $(69)             $(48)             $1            $(47)\n', u'\n\no    Restatement amounts relate to Automotive Group only, and do not impact the\n     reported results of TriMas. Operating profit for the Automotive Group as\n     restated is $63 million in 2002 and $59 million in 2001.\n\n\n(in millions)                   Nine Months Ending, September 28, 2003\n                         As Previously     Restatements     As Restated\n                           Reported\n\nOperating Profit              $36                $-                 $36\nLoss Before Taxes            $(26)              $(3)               $(29)\n\no    Restatement amounts relate to Automotive Group only, and do not impact the\n     reported results of TriMas.\n\n\nThe anticipated restatement adjustments, which are expected to result from the\ncompleted investigation described in a separate announcement regarding the\nannouncement of the completion of the independent accounting investigation,\nrelate principally to adjustments to correct overstated balances for property,\nplant and equipment and recognize lower related depreciation expense, recognize\nthe continuing effect of adjustments made in prior periods on previously\nreported balances of accounts payable and accounts receivable.\n\n     The Company is in the process of preparing the restatement and expects to\nmake appropriate filings with the Securities Exchange Commission of its restated\nresults and previously unfiled Securities Exchange Act reports as soon as\npracticable. As discussed, the information being released by the Company today\nis subject to its continuing review, as well as all nec-\n\n                                      -4-\n\n', u'\n\nessary review by its current and former independent auditors and others, and is\nsubject to further change. In addition, prior to the announcement of the\ninvestigation, the Commission provided the Company with comments on its filings\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the ordinary course and the Company\nexpects to respond to the Staff concerning those comments prior to filing\ndefinitive Forms 10-K and 10-Q\'s for the relevant periods. It is possible that\ndisclosure may change as a result of that review. In addition, the Company is\nseeking relief from certain disclosure requirements in the Form 10-K relating to\npre-acquisition periods and the Company may be delayed in filing definitive\ndocuments pending receipt of that relief or if such relief is not obtained.\n\nExtension of Waivers Sought\n\n     The Company is in the process of seeking an extension of waivers received\nfrom its senior lenders, receivables financing providers and certain lessors\nwith respect to its financial reporting, pending completion of the restatement.\nCurrent waivers expire on September 30, 2004. The Company presently anticipates\nthat the extended waiver now being sought will provide it with adequate time to\ncomplete the necessary restatement and prepare financial statements for recent\nunreported periods.\n\nAbout Metaldyne\n\n     Metaldyne is a leading global designer and supplier of metal-based\ncomponents, assemblies and modules for the automotive industry.
