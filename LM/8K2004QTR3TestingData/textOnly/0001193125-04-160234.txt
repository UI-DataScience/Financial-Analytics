', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a $242 million goodwill impairment to reflect the fair value of its regulated energy delivery business. As more fully\ndiscussed below in Item 4.02, the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors of Dynegy (\x93Audit Committee\x94) concluded on September 21, 2004, upon the recommendation of management and in consultation with its independent\nauditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers (\x93PwC\x94), that an additional after-tax impairment charge of approximately $259 million should have been reflected in the fourth quarter 2003 and additional after-tax impairments of $4 million and $2 million\nshould have been reflected in the first and second quarters of 2004, respectively. Neither the initial impairment nor the additional impairments will result in cash expenditures by the Company. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Item 4.02 Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report\nor Completed Interim Review. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'On September 22, 2004, Dynegy issued a press\nrelease announcing that, on September 21, 2004, the Audit Committee concluded that the previously issued financial statements contained in the Company\x92s 2003 Form 10-K and first and second quarter 2004 Form', u' 10-Qs should not be relied upon\nbecause of errors in those financial statements and that the Company would restate those financial statements to make the necessary accounting adjustments. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The restatements, which will be effected through amendments to Dynegy\x92s 2003 Form 10-K and first and second quarter 2004 Form 10-Qs, relate to Dynegy\x92s (i)\npreviously disclosed goodwill impairment charge associated with the pending sale of Illinois Power Company (\x93Illinois Power\x94) and (ii) deferred income tax accounts. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The previously disclosed $242 million goodwill impairment, which was taken by Dynegy to reflect the fair value of Illinois Power, was\noriginally recorded in the fourth quarter 2003. Recently, while preparing to record the sale of Illinois Power, Dynegy identified a deferred tax asset that was excluded from its fourth quarter 2003 impairment analysis. Dynegy\x92s exclusion of\nthis asset understated the net book value of the assets and, as a result, understated the impairment that had been recorded in the fourth quarter 2003. The Company, in consultation with PwC, concluded that an additional after-tax impairment charge\nof $259 million should have been reflected in the fourth quarter 2003 and additional after-tax impairments of $4 million and $2 million should have been reflected in the first and second quarters of 2004, respectively. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'As previously disclosed in Dynegy\x92s second quarter 2004 Form 10-Q, the Company is\ncurrently engaged in an evaluation of its tax accounting and reconciliation controls and processes, including an income tax review initiative. Through this initiative, Dynegy has also determined that adjustments related to its deferred income tax\naccounts in periods prior to 2004 are required. As Dynegy has not completed its analysis of all deferred income tax items, it is currently unable to determine the amount of the adjustments and the periods affected with certainty. However, Dynegy\ndoes anticipate, based on its ongoing review of these tax items, that these adjustments will reduce the Company\x92s deferred tax liability reflected on the balance sheet. Dynegy is working to complete this review as expeditiously as possible.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Based upon these matters, Dynegy expects to file amendments to its 2003 Form\n10-K and first and second quarter 2004 Form 10-Qs, reflecting the additional impairment charges of $265 million and all necessary deferred tax adjustments, prior to filing its third quarter 2004 Form 10-Q in November 2004. Accordingly, the\nreferenced financial statements should not be relied upon until such time as Dynegy files its restatements. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The decision to restate prior financial statements based on these matters was made by the Audit Committee, upon the recommendation of management and with the concurrence of PwC. Dynegy believes that the adjustments\nwill not impede the completion of the sale of Illinois Power, which remains on schedule to close before the end of 2004, or impact the Company\x92s current cash and liquidity positions or its previously announced 2004 earnings guidance estimate of\n$0.03 to $0.08 per share.

Any adjustments resulting from this initiative will not impact our cash and liquidity positions or our previously announced 2004 guidance estimate of $0.03 to $0.08 per share.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'It is our goal to reflect any adjustments necessary in previous financial\nstatements prior to the filing of our third quarter 2004 10-Q in November.
