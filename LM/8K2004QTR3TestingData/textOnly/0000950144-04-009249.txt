We grew revenues 32 percent, increased core earnings 46 percent and\nimproved core earnings per share 44 percent over fiscal 2004. Looking ahead, we\nplan to grow our business with the steady trend to outsourcing and believe 2005\nwill be another strong year for Jabil," said Timothy L. Main, President and\nChief Executive Officer.\n\nJabil provided guidance for its full fiscal year 2005 indicating that it\ncurrently foresees revenue in a range of $7.2 to $7.4 billion, core earnings\ngrowth of 18 to 22 percent and core earnings per share in a range of $1.20 to\n$1.24 per diluted share, depending upon levels of production. GAAP earnings per\nshare are currently estimated to be $1.05 to $1.09 per diluted share. (Expected\nGAAP earnings per share for the full fiscal year are currently estimated to\ninclude $0.15 per share for amortization of intangibles and acquisition related\ncharges.)\n\nJabil management also reiterated guidance for its first fiscal quarter of 2005,\nindicating they currently expect revenue to range from $1.75 to $1.85 billion\nand core earnings per share to be in a range of $0.30 to $0.32 per diluted\nshare, depending upon levels of production. GAAP earnings per share are\ncurrently estimated to be $0.26 to $0.28 per diluted share. (Expected GAAP\nearnings per share for the quarter are currently estimated to include $0.04 per\nshare for amortization of intangibles.)\n\n\n', u'\nQ4 2004 Earnings Release--Add Three\nSeptember 21, 2004\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\nThe financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures\ncalculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP\nfinancial measures, Jabil provides supplemental, non-GAAP financial measures to\nfacilitate evaluation of Jabil\'s core operating performance. The non-GAAP\nfinancial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are\nincluded in the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP, or core\nfinancial measures disclosed in this release do not have standard meanings and\nmay vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\n\nDue to its acquisitions and restructuring programs, Jabil has incurred\nsignificant incremental charges that are included in the GAAP financial measures\ndisclosed in this release. Management believes that the incremental nature of\nthese amounts does not impact the performance of its core manufacturing\noperations. Management believes core financial measures (which exclude the\neffects of the amortization of intangibles, acquisition related charges,\nrestructuring and impairment charges and other income) are a useful measure that\nfacilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil\'s ongoing\noperations on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core earnings and core operating\nincome to provide its investors with an alternative method for assessing its\nearnings and operating income from what it believes to be its core manufacturing\noperations. Included in this release is a GAAP Consolidated Statement of Income,\na non-GAAP Consolidated Statement of Income, as well as a reconciliation of the\ndisclosed core financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial\nmeasures.\n\nCOMPANY CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nJabil Circuit will conduct a conference call to announce its fourth quarter and\nfiscal 2004 earnings today at 4:30 p.m. EDT, live on the Internet at\nhttp://jabil.com.
