LOUIS, August 26, 2004 ---- Allied Healthcare Products, Inc. (NASDAQ: AHPI)\nreported today that it earned a net income of $860,000, or 10 cents per diluted\nshare, during its fourth quarter ended June 30, 2004, compared to a loss of\n$106,000, or a negative 1 cent per diluted share, for the quarter ended June 30,\n2003.\n\n         Sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 totaled $15.3 million\nversus $14.3 million for the fourth quarter of the previous year, an increase of\n7.0 percent. Gross Profit, as a percentage of sales, improved to 30.3% in the\nfourth quarter of fiscal 2004, from 22.6% in the fourth quarter of 2003.\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2004 were lower by 6.6 percent than\nthey were in the fourth quarter of 2003.\n\n         For the 2004 fiscal year ending June 30, 2004, Allied returned to\nprofitability despite sales that declined about 3 percent or $1.7 million from\nthe previous year.\n\n         Allied earned a net income of $1.9 million, or 23 cents per diluted\nshare, for the 2004 fiscal year compared with a loss of $158,000, or negative 2\ncents per diluted share, for fiscal 2003.\n\n         Lower production costs and operating expenses in 2004 more than offset\nthe year's sales decline.

Operating\nexpenses were reduced about $ 0.8 million for 2004, primarily through staff\nreductions.\n\n         Debt was reduced $6.4 million during fiscal 2004, from $10 million to\n$3.6 million.\n\n", u'\n         "Throughout fiscal 2004, strong operating results and inventory\nmanagement helped us increase cash flow, improve margins and strengthen our\nbalance sheet," said Earl R. Refsland, president and chief executive officer.\n"Sluggish sales have held us back, so building sales remains our top priority."\n\n          Allied Healthcare Products, Inc. is a leading manufacturer of\nrespiratory care products, medical gas equipment and emergency medical products\nused in a wide range of hospital and alternate care settings.\n\n"SAFE HARBOR" STATEMENT: Statements contained in this release that are not\nhistorical facts or information are "forward-looking statements."
