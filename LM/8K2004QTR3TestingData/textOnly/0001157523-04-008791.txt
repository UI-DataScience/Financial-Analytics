(NYSE:PBG) today reported third quarter 2004 net income of\n$191 million, or diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.73, which\nincludes a $0.02 gain from the settlement of certain international tax\naudits. These results compare to reported third quarter 2003 net\nincome of $183 million, or EPS of $0.67. Reported year-to-date net\nincome was $383 million, or EPS of $1.44, which includes the $0.02 tax\ngain. These results compare to reported year-to-date 2003 net income\nof $353 million, or $1.26 per share, before accounting for the\ncumulative effect of the adoption of a new accounting principle, which\nreduced EPS by $0.02.\n\n    --  Worldwide physical case volume grew two percent on a constant\n        territory basis in the third quarter. PBG\'s U.S. business\n        delivered one-percent volume growth and the Company\'s European\n        business generated a five-percent increase in volume. In\n        Mexico, strong marketplace execution led to a three-percent\n        improvement in physical case volume.\n\n    --  In the U.S., PBG delivered another consecutive quarter of net\n        revenue per case growth, up three percent for the third\n        quarter. Worldwide, net revenue per case improved two percent.\n\n    --  Given three quarters of strong earnings performance, PBG\n        adjusted its full-year earnings expectations to a range of\n        $1.71 to $1.74, excluding the previously mentioned tax gain.\n\n    "Outstanding execution in the marketplace drove our results in the\nthird quarter," said John T. Cahill, Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer of PBG. "In the U.S., we were faced with a soft retail\nenvironment this past quarter, as well as a challenging year-over-year\nvolume lap. Our field organization rose to the challenge and delivered\none-percent volume improvement, with growth in both the cold drink and\ntake home channels of our business. Brand Mountain Dew performance was\nstrong, benefiting from the introduction of the latest line extension,\nMountain Dew Pitch Black, near the end of the quarter. Tropicana juice\ndrinks continued to perform well, achieving three points of share\nsince the introduction earlier this year. Our net revenue per case\nresults were very good, growing for the 20th consecutive quarter\nexcluding the impact of last year\'s accounting change."\n    Cahill continued, "We were very pleased with our positive volume\nresults in Mexico. This volume improvement was consistent across our\nportfolio with growth generated from our carbonated soft drinks,\nbottled water and jug water. These results reflect the ongoing\nprogress we\'re making on a number of fronts. While there remains a lot\nof work ahead of us in Mexico, we believe we\'re on the right track to\nsustained improvement."\n    On a constant territory basis, physical case volume worldwide grew\ntwo percent in the third quarter. (Constant territory calculations\nassume all significant acquisitions made in 2003 were made at the\nbeginning of 2003 and exclude all significant acquisitions made in\n2004.) In the U.S., volume in PBG\'s cold drink business grew one\npercent, while its take home volume was positive. PBG\'s business in\nCanada also increased its volume one percent in the quarter. The\nCompany\'s businesses in Europe collectively generated five percent\ngrowth in volume, with its Russian and Turkey territories each\ndelivering double-digit volume improvement. Physical case volume of\ncarbonated soft drinks in Mexico grew three percent for the quarter.\nSales of bottled water and jug water in Mexico also improved, up 18\nand two percent respectively.\n    Worldwide operating income was flat in the third quarter. This was\ndue primarily to rising raw materials costs and higher benefit and\ncompensation expenses. Year-to-date, worldwide operating income grew\nfour percent.\n    During the third quarter of 2004, PBG repurchased 6.8 million\nshares of common stock. Since the inception of the Company\'s share\nrepurchase program in October 1999, more than 80 million shares have\nbeen repurchased.\n    The Company revised upward the lower end of the range of its\nestimate for full year 2004 earnings per share. The current forecast\nis for EPS of $1.71 to $1.74 excluding the previously mentioned tax\ngain. PBG reiterated its expectations for worldwide physical case\nvolume growth for the full year 2004 of two to three percent with net\nrevenue per case improvement of two to three percent. The Company\'s\noperating income outlook for 2004 remains unchanged, with growth\nexpected to come in at the mid-single digit range. PBG expects cash\nfrom operations less capital expenditures to be approximately $530\nmillion, a 20 percent increase over 2003 results. The Company expects\ncapital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $675 to $700\nmillion.\n    The Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc.
