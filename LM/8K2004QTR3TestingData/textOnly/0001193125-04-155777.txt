', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 increased 9.8% to $11.3 million from $10.3\nmillion for the same period last year.

During the third quarter of 2003, gross profit margin was negatively impacted by a charge\nof $166,000 resulting from a change in estimate with respect to the net realizable value of certain finished goods inventory; and a charge of $133,000 resulting from a change in estimate regarding the collectibility of a refund associated with raw\nmaterial purchases.

', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The largest element of the net increase in SG&A expenses was compensation costs. The\nincrease in compensation costs represented approximately 65% of the net increase. Compensation costs have increased as a result of increases in commissions as net sales have increased, increases in employee incentives targeted to improve financial\nresults, incentives paid to the sales force associated with the Company\x92s market segment initiatives and new hires. Other costs that contributed to the increase in SG&A include costs associated with the expensing of restricted stock grants\nfor both members of management and non-employee directors.', u' ', u'As previously disclosed, during fiscal year 2004 the Company began using restricted stock grants as management incentives in lieu of stock options. Additionally, during 2004, in\naccordance with the Company\x92s 2004 Non-employee Directors Stock Plan approved by the shareholders at its annual meeting on March 9, 2004, Optical Cable began using restricted stock grants as partial compensation for non-employee directors as\npayment for Board services in lieu of cash. Generally, restricted stock grants are expensed over the vesting period of the grant, where stock options historically have not been expensed.

Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 increased 5.0% to $31.3 million from $29.8 million for the same period last year.

We will then briefly review some of the financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2004 and then comment on some recent\ndevelopments at OCC. Finally, we\x92ll answer as many of your questions as we can.', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'OPTICAL CABLE CORPORATION', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Page\xa01', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'I would like to remind everyone that Optical Cable Corporation like a number of other companies does not provide specific earnings guidance. Having said that, we continue to see signs that the\nshort to moderate distance fiberoptic cable market is gaining strength.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Consistent with statements we made last quarter, we continue to believe our markets will show annual growth percentages in the single digit during fiscal 2004. That belief is consistent with our\nyear-to-date net sales which increased 5% compared to the same period last year and with our third quarter net sales which showed a 9.8% increase over the previous year\x92s third quarter.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'As we\x92ve reported in prior quarters this year, we continue to see strong forward sales load.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'The pattern of net sales we experienced during fiscal year 2003 and the first nine months of 2004 are consistent with the seasonality patterns experienced by the company prior to fiscal year\n2001. Specifically, net sales historically were relatively lower in the first half of each fiscal year and relatively higher in the second half of each fiscal year. We expect that pattern to continue during the remainder of this\nyear.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'We continue to believe our market position is solid relative to the competition. As stated in prior quarters, we continue to focus on increasing profitable sales ahead of the market and building\nthe critical mass of infrastructure and human resources needed to execute our strategy.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Now let\x92s review the results for the third quarter.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'We reported net income of $318,000, or 6 cents per basic and diluted share for our third fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2004, compared to a net loss of $71,000, or 1 cent per basic and diluted\nshare for the same period last year.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'On a year-to-date basis, we reported net income of $419,000, or 8 cents per basic share and 7 cents per diluted share compared to a net loss of $91,000 or 2 cents per basic and diluted share for\nthe same period last year. This also compares to $315,000 or 5 cents per share of net income for all of fiscal year 2003.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 increased 9.8% to $11.3 million from $10.3 million for the same period last year. Sequentially net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2004\nincreased 5.7% compared to net sales of $10.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2004.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 increased 5% to $31.3 million from $29.8 million for the same period last year.', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'OPTICAL CABLE CORPORATION', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Page\xa02', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter was 40.6% compared to 29.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2003. By comparison, the gross margin was 39% for the first quarter of\nfiscal 2004 and 39.2% for the second quarter of fiscal 2004.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'The higher than expected gross profit margin in the third quarter of 2004 was positively impacted by the sale of a mix of products with higher margins during the period.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'During the third quarter of 2003, you will recall gross profit margin was negatively impacted by a charge of $166,000 resulting from a change in estimate with respect to a net realizable value\nof certain finished goods inventory and a charge of $133,000 resulting from a change in estimate regarding the collectability of a refund associated with raw material purchases.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'The company\x92s gross profit margin increased to 39.6% for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 compared to 34.8% for the same period last year.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'I have stated in previous earnings calls that we expected our gross margins to be in the 33% to 35% range over the longer term. At the same time, I\x92ve also indicated that Optical Cable will\ncontinue to make efforts to sell higher margin products into targeted markets and to control manufacturing costs as appropriate.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'The higher than anticipated gross profit margin during the first nine months of fiscal year 2004 was the result of the sale of a mix of products with higher margins during the period and the\nresult of the sale of inventory which had previously been estimated to be at a lower net realizable value compared with manufactured costs during the first quarter.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'At this point we anticipate our gross margins may be slightly higher than we originally thought with a more likely range being 35% to 37% for the foreseeable future. A number of factors could\nimpact our expectation, however, including product sales mix as well as changes in our judgment and estimates regarding the saleability of individual inventory items and our estimate of the ultimate selling prices for those items.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 increased 38.9% to $4.0 million compared to $2.9 million during the same period last year. The largest element\nof the net increase in SG&A expenses was compensation costs. The increase in compensation costs represents approximately 65% of the net increase. Compensation costs have increased as a result of increases in commissions as net sales have\nincreased, increases in employee incentives targeted to improve financial results which were achieved so far this year, incentives paid to the salesforce associated with our market segment initiatives as well as new hires.', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'OPTICAL CABLE CORPORATION', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Page\xa03', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Other compensation costs that have contributed to the increase include costs associated with expensing restricted stock grants for both members of the management team and non-employee\ndirectors. As previously disclosed, during fiscal year 2004 we began using restricted stock grants as management incentives in lieu of stock options.

Wenck', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Very nice quarter. I know you made some comments about the gross margins and you\x92ve raised the range a little bit from what previous comments that had been. But on earlier calls,\nI\x92ve asked some questions about how much previously written down inventory might have increased gross margins. It seemed like that was a relatively minor contributor. Is that still the case?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'M.\xa0Wilkin', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'It\x92s a minor contributor and it\x92s been a consistent contributor. We do have each quarter some write off of old inventory but it\x92s been rather consistent. The only unusual event\nthat occurred in Q1 which is we had some previously written off inventory that we sold and that contributed to increasing the gross margin in Q1.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'K. Wenck', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'My memory of our discussion on that call was it might have increased gross margins .2% or something as a percentage of sales, so you\x92re getting it most from product mix. Is that still\ncorrect?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'N. Wilkin', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'I don\x92t recall the exact percentage from our prior discussion but yes, most of this is from product mix and because we sell to various different industries and various different customer\ntypes and for various different applications, some of that we can control through our marketing efforts, but some of it depends on demand at any point in time.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'K. Wenck', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Help us understand why the gross margins you\x92ve seen through the first three quarters now of the year will possibly go back to lower levels. Could you give us any more color as to what\nkind of product mix is driving the current gross margins because after 3 quarters of them looking pretty consistent at this point and slight improvements sequentially each quarter, it\x92d be helpful for us to understand what\x92s going to cause\nthem to go back to the 35% to 37% range.', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'OPTICAL CABLE CORPORATION', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Page\xa05', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'N.\xa0Wilkin', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'I think as you know, Kevin, from dealing with me I try to make sure we\x92re not overly optimistic in a way that would be inappropriate and our best estimates based on where we see the\nfourth quarter so far which obviously our visibility\x92s a little bit limited, but we have some indications, and the fact that we\x92ve seen fluctuations. I mean the first quarter would have been exactly in that range but for this inventory\nsale that we had. I feel uncomfortable raising it to a much higher rate.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'I\x92m not saying it can\x92t go higher and clearly we are doing our utmost to improve our efficiencies and improve our gross margins through not only the sale of product mix but\nwhat\x92s being done on the operations side. At this point I just feel uncomfortable saying it\x92s going to be much higher than the 35%-37% range.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'That doesn\x92t mean it won\x92t be, but I\x92d really feel like I was not being fair to you all if it ended up being in that range but I was on this call saying we expected it to be\nexactly as it had been in the second and third quarters.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'We have large projects that can significantly influence our margins from quarter-to-quarter. We\x92ve been very fortunate as to how that\x92s played out this quarter and I think the\n35-37% is a good range but I can guarantee you we\x92re working to make it higher at every opportunity. One thing that\x92s helping us is as the industry has gained strength recently, we\x92re not seeing and don\x92t expect to see\nsignificant pricing pressures.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'K.\xa0Wenck', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Okay, thanks for your time.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Operator', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Thank you sir.

Wenck', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Just too early for everyone this morning. In terms of looking into next year, what kind of hiring plans do you have at this point and what would a preliminary capital budget look like at this\npoint?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'N. Wilkin', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'I\x92m not prepared to comment on a capital budget at this point, what it\x92s going to look like for next year. We\x92re not far enough along internally to comment at this\npoint.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'What I would say is you\x92ll notice in our press release we don\x92t include the statement of cash flows. You\x92ll notice when we file the 10Q which should be before the end of this\nweek, we had originally budgeted $2.6 million as I\x92ve said on prior calls for capital expenditures for this year and we haven\x92t quite been expending as much money as we anticipated simply because we\x92re taking our time and doing it\nsmartly rather than arbitrary spending money.', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'OPTICAL CABLE CORPORATION', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Page\xa06', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'What you\x92ll notice when you look at the 10Q is that we haven\x92t quite stayed on target for $2.6 by the end of the fiscal year. In fact, we\x92re substantially short of that. When\nyou look at the cash flow statement in the 10Q, also look at the commitments that we\x92ve made because there\x92s some things we\x92ve spent recently that are rather significant that you\x92ll at least get an idea of where we\x92re at\nyear-to-date in the 10Q.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'I can\x92t really say what the budget is. We\x92ve got our list of things that we\x92re changing and improvements we\x92re making to build out the infrastructure and items that have\nbeen budgeted for this year that don\x92t get spent are going to be carried over to next year.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'I only answered your question about the cap ex. The other question was number of people. With respect to the number of people, there\x92s 2 groups of folks that end up impacting our income\nstatement. You have the folks that we add on the production floor and that gets put into cost of goods sold. Then we have other folks, whether it be engineering or other positions that end up in sales and general and administrative sales people,\neverything else other than production essentially.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'We\x92ve been continuing to add and we\x92ve had a number of folks start last week on the production side and even as we\x92ve been adding people, the gross margins have been holding\nup.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'With respect to other adds there\x92s a couple of individuals that we plan on hiring to expand our engineering group. As part of the reorganization we talked about last quarter, technology\nand engineering is expanding its capabilities but I don\x92t see at this point that it\x92s going to significantly impact our SG&A expenses above our current levels.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'I haven\x92t given you any specifics. I don\x92t want to get into a specific headcount as far as adds go, but hopefully that answers your question and gives you an idea of where\nwe\x92re at.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'K.\xa0Wenck', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'What is headcount currently?', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'N. Wilkin', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'It is 199 people which includes some independent dedicated contractors but that\x92s consistent with the number we\x92ve been disclosing previously.

Maybe an internal assessment of things that you feel the company is doing very well right now and then some areas that you feel that you\x92re\nstill working on to improve things with the company.', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'OPTICAL CABLE CORPORATION', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Page\xa07', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'N.\xa0Wilkin', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'I think there\x92s a number of things we do very well which is the reason why we continue to be well positioned in the marketplace.

That\x92s an area where we\x92re going to see a future benefit going forward and it\x92s something we\x92re addressing.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'As part of that, I continually am working towards getting better and more information more quickly and getting that pushed down further in the organization so that people can continue to\nimprove their decision making capabilities and really act in a more significant way towards advancing the company at all levels.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'I\x92m a big believer in the fact that each person at the company, no matter what their position, has a real opportunity to significantly impact our profitability, significantly impact our\nrelationship with customers, significantly impact our efficiency.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'On weakness, I guess one of the things, Kevin, and you and I\x92ve talked about and I don\x92t know if I\x92d describe it particularly as a weakness, but something that we\x92ll\ncontinue to look at improving is our investor relations function and we\x92ve taken some steps down that road but I think there\x92s some further steps we can take.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'You know how sensitive I am to the fact that I want to make sure we\x92re getting good information out to people but I don\x92t want to be acting in a way that would somehow artificially\naffect our stock price. I\x92ve said on numerous occasions that I think the best way to improve our stock performance is to focus on the fundamentals of the business and prove as I believe this year we have, at least through the third quarter, our\nability to increase profits, increase efficiencies, increase sales and to continue to do that going forward.', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'OPTICAL CABLE CORPORATION', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Page\xa08', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'I guess another strength while we\x92re circling around and I\x92m starting to ramble a little bit, but another strength that I really want to focus on is the fact that OCC, the\nmanagement team, is really focused on building that critical mass that\x92s necessary to sustain the company through future growth. One of the things I hope shareholders will see and that I expect to see is over the longer term as sales increase,\nwe can start to see more dollars dropping to the net income line and I think that\x92s a real advantage of what we\x92re doing now and what we\x92re building now.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'K.\xa0Wenck', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Great, thanks a lot for all your comments.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Operator', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'Thank you sir.
