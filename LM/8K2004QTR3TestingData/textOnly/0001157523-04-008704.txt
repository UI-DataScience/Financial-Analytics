The Company recorded net income of $992,000, or $0.02 per\ndiluted share, a 19% increase, compared with net income of $833,000,\nor $0.02 per diluted share reported in third quarter 2003. For the\nnine months ended August 31, 2004, net sales were $29.4 million, an\nincrease of 37%, and net income was $2.7 million ($0.05 per diluted\nshare), an increase of 85% compared, to $1.5 million ($0.03 per\ndiluted share), for the same period in 2003. Net income during the\nquarter was effected by increased investment in additional sales and\nclinical personnel, regulatory compliance costs associated with\nSarbanes-Oxley, and expenses attributable to the design and future\nlaunch of the BioZ Dx, the Company\'s co-developed product with Philips\nMedical Systems.\n\n           Operating Highlights:\n\n           During third quarter 2004, shipments of ICG devices totaled 284\nunits, including 236 ICG monitors, an increase of 21% over third\nquarter 2003, and 48 ICG modules. Included in shipments for the\nquarter were eight Medis ICG monitors and 14 BioZ systems under the\nCompany\'s rental and guarantee programs. The total number of ICG\nsystems and modules sold to date is now over 4,700 (including 117\ncumulative Medis units). Currently, field associates total 79 people,\nincluding 50 U.S. territory managers and 19 clinical application\nspecialists.\n           Combined ICG and electrocardiograph (ECG) sensor revenue was $4.1\nmillion, representing 37% of total net sales in the third quarter\n2004. During the quarter, Vermed contributed $2.4 million to net\nsales. ICG sensor revenue for the third quarter 2004 was $1.7 million\n(20% of total ICG net sales), an increase of 16%, compared to $1.5\nmillion (19% of total ICG net sales) in the same quarter 2003.\n           Operating cash flow for third quarter 2004 was a record $1.7\nmillion, an increase of 162% or $1.0 million, compared to $637,000 in\nthe same quarter 2003. For the nine months ended August 31, 2004,\noperating cash flow was $3.6 million, an increase of 206% or $2.4\nmillion, compared to $1.2 million for the same nine-month period in\n2003. The Company ended the third quarter 2004 with $7.1 million in\ncash and paid down its bank term loan by over $1 million during the\nquarter.\n           Gross margin for the third quarter 2004 was 69%, of which the ICG\nbusiness was 75% and Vermed was 45%. This compares to 77% for ICG\nbusiness in the same quarter last year. The decrease in overall gross\nmargin was the result of lower gross margins associated with Vermed\'s\nECG sensor products and an increase in lower-priced U.S. and\ninternational distributor business. The Company is currently piloting\ntwo new sales partnership programs with the Caligor division of Henry\nSchein and Physician Sales & Service, Inc. (PSS).\n\n           CEO Comments and Outlook:\n\n           "The third quarter was one of investment for CardioDynamics,"\nstated Michael K. Perry, Chief Executive Officer. "In addition to\ngrowing the number of territory managers to a record level, we\nsignificantly increased the number of clinical application specialists\nby 36% over the previous quarter. We believe this investment will\nimprove productivity by allowing our territory sales managers to focus\non new system sales, as our clinical team drives recurring revenue\ngrowth through support of our expanding customer base."\n           Perry added, "We enter the fourth quarter 2004 with a strong sales\nand clinical force armed with the multi-center PREDICT study results\ndemonstrating ICG as the most powerful predictor of heart failure\noutcomes. We look forward to the initial launch of the BioZ Dx, our\nco-developed product with Philips, and manufacturing of our ICG\nsensors at Vermed. We believe these strategic initiatives will\ncontribute appreciably to our operating performance in fiscal 2005. In\nthe coming months, we intend to build additional awareness for our ICG\ntechnology, accelerate revenue growth, and improve ICG sensor margins.\nWith over 2.7 million patients monitored, we are fundamentally\nchanging the way cardiovascular medicine is practiced around the\nworld."\n\n           Conference Call Information:\n\n           Michael K.
