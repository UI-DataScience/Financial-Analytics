All amounts are expressed in United States dollars unless otherwise noted. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Restatement of Prior Period Financial Statements ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In connection with the preparation of our fiscal 2004 annual results, we\ndetermined that our previously published financial statements reflected errors in fiscal 2002 and 2003. These financial statements did not properly reflect the treatment of certain revenue recognition, stock-based compensation charges, and operating\nexpenses relating to a lease liability. Several additional adjustments were also identified. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The financial statements included in this revised Annual Report as of March 31, 2003 and 2002 and for the years ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 and the eleven months ended March 31, 2001 reflect the appropriate\ncharacterization of certain revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, rent expense, and other noted adjustments. The restatement adjustments have no impact on the net cash flows of the Company. Investors should rely solely on the financial\nstatements in this revised Annual Report, and not on previously published financial statements. A complete discussion of the restated financial data is included in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this revised Annual\nReport. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Overview ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'BakBone Software Incorporated (the Company) is an international storage\nmanagement software company that develops and globally distributes storage management solutions to the open systems markets, providing data protection and management solutions scalable from workgroup to enterprise. Our corporate headquarters is\nlocated in San Diego, California. This facility houses executive management as well as sales, marketing, engineering, customer support and administrative departments. We maintain offices in Tokyo, Japan and Poole, Dorset, United Kingdom, whose\nprimary activities surround the sales, marketing and administrative functions for the Asian and European regions, respectively. In addition, our United Kingdom and San Diego offices include engineering personnel responsible for the development\neffort of our NetVault core and NetVault Application Plug-in Module (APM) software products, respectively. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We have incurred operating losses and net losses since inception of our operations in March 2000. Our operating losses were $7.7 million, $12.1 million\nand $19.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 and the eleven months ended March 31, 2001, respectively. We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $50.6\xa0million through March 31, 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Subsequent to the MagnaVault product line\x92s \x93end of life\x94,\neffective December 31, 2002, the Company develops and sells one main product, NetVault. The following is a brief discussion of the product. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'NetVault ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'NetVault is a backup and recovery software that permits computer network administrators to maintain \x93backup\x94 copies of documents, data, images\nand records so that they may be restored for access if files are lost or corrupted in the event of a future catastrophic local server or network failure. NetVault addresses the growing data storage needs of systems administrators across a wide range\nof storage topologies, including: Direct Attached Storage (DAS), Storage Area Networks (SAN), Network Attached Storage (NAS), Local Area Networks (LAN) and Wide Area Networks (WAN). NetVault\x92s scalable, modular architecture meets the challenges\nof storage management for a wide variety of applications, including those used by firms worldwide such as Oracle, Informix, DB2, SQL, Sybase and Microsoft Exchange. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'1 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'NetVault is a fully functional software suite that offers several advantages over competitive products\n(such as Veritas\x92 NetBackup and Legato\x92s Networker). Recognizing the impact of emerging trends, NetVault was redesigned in 1999 to allow for the rapid and seamless integration of new features. From a business standpoint, this gives BakBone\nfaster adaptations for new databases, operating systems and devices. This time to market in our dynamically changing industry is key for customers. From a user\x92s standpoint, it allows for the addition of new features and enhancements without\nadding significant administrative burden. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Target Markets\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'BakBone\x92s software can be used in virtually any\nindustry where there is a need for electronic data or images to be backed up, archived or prepared for disaster recovery. The environments covered within those industries range from workgroup, to departmental, to enterprise-wide. More specifically,\nwithin those environments, BakBone\x92s product is targeted to networked storage, a market projected to constitute 70% of all data storage by the year 2006, according to an IDC December 2002 report. The growth of networked storage is due to the\nemergence of cost and performance efficiencies associated with NAS and SAN solutions, for which NetVault is designed. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Technology Alliances ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'One of BakBone\x92s key areas of focus is working with complementary storage software and hardware vendors to assure smooth operation of our software\nwith other solution devices. BakBone maintains an interoperability laboratory that is populated with an extensive array of hardware and software from all the leading storage vendors. To date, over 500 configurations have been tested and certified\nwith BakBone software. Certified hardware includes drives and libraries including, but not limited to: HP, Hitachi, IBM, Panasonic, Quantum/ATL, Seagate, Sony, and StorageTek, as well as a variety of smaller storage manufacturers. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Product Distribution ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We presently market our software and associated services indirectly to\nend-user customers through sales channels such as resellers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), solution providers, hardware distributors, application software vendors and systems integrators. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'BakBone Software KK, located in Tokyo, Japan, distributes NetVault software\nin the Pacific Rim via distribution channels in Japan and other countries throughout Asia. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'BakBone Software Ltd., located in the United Kingdom, distributes NetVault software in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'BakBone Software Inc., located in the United States, distributes NetVault software throughout the United\xa0States, Canada and Latin America.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Operating Results ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Investors should rely solely on the financial statements in this revised\nAnnual Report and not on any other previously published financial statements. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our operating results for the year ended March 31, 2003 (restated) compared to the year ended March 31, 2002 (restated). ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Revenues ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Revenues increased approximately 82%, to $17.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2003, from $9.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2002. Revenues\nfor the year ended March 31, 2003 consisted of $15.3 ', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'2 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'million in licensing revenues and $2.6 million in service revenues, compared to revenues for the year ended March 31, 2002, which consisted of $8.1 million\nin licensing revenues and $1.8 million in service revenues. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Licensing Revenues ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our products are\nsold almost exclusively through our channel partners, value-added resellers (VARs), value-added distributors (VADs) and OEMs, in three geographic segments: North America, Asia and Europe. OEM revenues prior to fiscal 2003 were not significant, but\nthey increased substantially in all regions due to our relationship with NCR Teradata (NCR). Substantially all of our OEM revenues to date have been derived from our worldwide relationship with NCR. We anticipate that OEM licensing revenues\nworldwide will continue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues as we expand our relationship with NCR. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In North America, licensing revenues for the year ended March 31, 2003 increased approximately 96% to $5.9 million, from $3.0 million for the year ended\nMarch 31, 2002. Licensing revenues growth in North America was driven by both the reseller and OEM channels. During fiscal 2003, we established many new reseller relationships, while leveraging existing relationships to grow our revenues through the\nreseller channel. Prior to fiscal 2003, North American OEM licensing revenues were relatively insignificant in terms of consolidated revenues, but fiscal 2003 experienced significant OEM licensing revenues growth. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In Asia, licensing revenues for the year ended March 31, 2003 increased\napproximately 71% to $6.3 million, from $3.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2002. Similar to North America, Asia grew licensing revenues through both the reseller and OEM channels. The year ended March 31, 2003 was the first year in which Asia\ngenerated significant OEM revenues. This was due to the strength of our worldwide relationship with NCR, who accounted for a majority of Asia\x92s OEM revenues during fiscal 2003. Additionally, expansion into new territories during fiscal 2003,\nincluding India and Kuala Lumpur, contributed to the increase in licensing revenues in fiscal 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In Europe, licensing revenues for the year ended March 31, 2003 increased approximately 125% to $3.1 million, from $1.4 million for the year ended March\n31, 2002. Increased sales to existing resellers, supplemented by sales to new resellers, and the maturation of our relationship with NCR, helped to drive revenues higher. Furthermore, licensing revenues increased due to the fact that we increased\nthe significance of our operations in several territories, most notably Germany, during the year ended March 31, 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Service Revenues ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Service revenues consist principally of maintenance revenues derived from the sale of customer support contracts. These contract fees generally\napproximate 20% of the licensing fee. Revenues from customer support contracts are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, generally one year. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In North America, service revenues for the year ended March 31, 2003 increased approximately 49% to $1.5 million, from $1.0\nmillion for the year ended March 31, 2002. In Asia, service revenues for the year ended March 31, 2003 increased approximately 48% to $532,000, from $359,000 for the year ended March 31, 2002. In Europe, service revenues for the year ended March 31,\n2003 increased approximately 45% to $550,000, from $379,000 for the year ended March 31, 2002. The worldwide increase in service revenues is directly related to the increased licensing revenues from sales to new customers and to maintenance contract\nrenewals from existing customers. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Cost of Revenues\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Cost of revenues for the year ended March 31, 2003\ntotaled $1.7 million with a gross margin of 91%, compared with cost of revenues of $1.2 million with a gross margin of 87% for the year ended March 31, 2002. These costs consisted primarily of the direct cost of providing customer support, including\nsalary and benefits of ', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'3 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'staff working in our customer support departments as well as associated costs of computer equipment, telephone and other general costs necessary to maintain\nan adequate level of customer support to our end users. Also included in cost of revenues are the direct costs of raw materials and packaging for the products shipped to customers. These costs, however, are nominal as the products shipped to\ncustomers consist of a CD, manual, printed box and other media. Product costs for these items individually and in aggregate are minimal and we have little risk of inventory obsolescence due to the small quantities of these items needed to fill our\ncustomers\x92 orders and the short lead time to acquire additional materials. Raw material purchases are held in inventory until the sale of the related software product at which time the cost per unit sold is released to cost of revenues.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The decrease in cost of revenues as a percent of total\nrevenues for the year ended March 31, 2003 compared to the year ended March 31, 2002 was due primarily to the overall increase in service revenues. As cost of revenues is comprised primarily of fixed customer support salaries, cost of revenues as a\npercent of total revenues is likely to decrease as revenues increase. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Sales and Marketing Expenses ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Sales and\nmarketing expenses consist primarily of payroll, commission, marketing, and travel costs for our worldwide sales staff. Sales and marketing expenses increased $1.4 million, or 13%, to $12.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2003, from $10.8\nmillion for the year ended March 31, 2002. The increase was attributed primarily to an increase in performance-based (i.e. commissions and bonuses) payments, which are a direct function of revenues. Headcount remained relatively stable, although the\nyear ended March 31, 2003 experienced a slight increase in salaries expense due to the hiring of a VP of Sales and a VP of Marketing during fiscal 2003. Furthermore, our expansion into new territories, primarily in Asia and Europe, contributed to\nthe increase. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of\ntotal revenues for the year ended March 31, 2003 decreased to 68%, from 109% for the year ended March 31, 2002. The decrease was due primarily to the increase in total revenues. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Research and Development Expenses ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and related costs for our worldwide engineering staff.\nResearch and development expenses increased $442,000, or 10%, to $5.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2003, from $4.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2002. The overall increase was due primarily to increased salaries and travel-related\nexpenditures. During the first six months of fiscal 2003, headcount was increased in order to facilitate the increase in NetVault product development and product sales volume. In November 2002, headcount was reduced in conjunction with the\nMagnaVault exit activities. Although headcount between March 31, 2003 and March 31, 2002 remained stable, year-over-year salary expense actually increased due to the aforementioned hiring that took place during the first half of the fiscal year.\nAdditionally, increased travel-related costs surrounding off-site software testing activities added to the overall increase in research and development expenses. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended March 31, 2003 decreased to 28%, from\n46% for the year ended March 31, 2002. The decrease was due primarily to the increase in total revenues. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'General and Administrative Expenses ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'General and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits for our corporate personnel and other expenses, such as facilities costs and\nprofessional services. General and administrative expenses increased $528,000, or 9%, during the year ended March 31, 2003. The increase in general and administrative expenses relates primarily to increases in payroll and insurance premiums, as well\nas to a charge relating to the administration of an employee stock program. Although headcount remained stable, salary and related costs ', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'4 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'increased slightly due to annual compensation increases. Recent national and global events have caused insurance premiums to increase leading to an increase\nin our insurance costs. Finally, we incurred an operating charge related to the administration of an employee stock program, which was established in March 2000 as a retention tool for key personnel associated with an acquired entity. We had not\nincurred such a charge prior to fiscal 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'General and\nadministrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended March 31, 2003 decreased to 33%, from 55% for the year ended March 31, 2002. The decrease was due primarily to the increase in total revenues. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Stock-based Compensation ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Effective April 1, 2002, we adopted the Canadian Institute of Chartered\nAccountants Handbook (CICA) Section 3870, ', u'Stock-based Compensation and Other Stock-based Payments ', u'(Section 3870), under which we are required to apply a fair value-based method of accounting for all stock-based payments issued to\nnon-employees and all direct awards of stock to employees. We continue to use settlement date accounting to account for employee stock options. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'During the year ended March 31, 2003, we recognized $536,000 in stock-based compensation expense in connection with the issuance of certain equity\ninstruments to non-employees for services they rendered to us. The fair value of these equity instruments was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and was recorded as stock-based compensation expense during the year ended March\n31, 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Special Charges ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In November 2002, we undertook a plan to cease all activities, with the\nexception of customer support, related to the MagnaVault product offering. In connection with the MagnaVault exit activities, we recorded a charge of $415,000 during the year ended March 31, 2003. The charge was comprised of expenses related to\nemployee severance of $87,000, idle facility costs of $192,000 and fixed asset impairment and other exit costs totaling $136,000. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Amortization of Goodwill ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Effective April 1, 2002 and pursuant to CICA Section 3062, ', u'Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets', u' (CICA Section 3062), goodwill is no longer\namortized, but is reviewed at least annually for impairment. Therefore, we incurred no amortization expense during the year ended March 31, 2003 compared to $3.7 million during the year ended March 31, 2002. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Amortization of intangible assets ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In connection with our acquisition of BakBone KK in March 2002, we recorded\n$222,000 in separately identifiable intangible assets. These intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life, or four years. Thus, we recognized $55,000 in amortization expense during the year ended March 31, 2003. We incurred no\nsuch charge during the year ended March 31, 2002. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Impairment of Goodwill ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We recorded\ngoodwill impairment charges of $888,000 and $2.5 million for the years ended March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The impairment charges in fiscal 2003 and 2002 related to goodwill recorded in connection with our acquisition of the MagnaVault\nintellectual property. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In connection with the acquisition of\nTracer, we acquired exclusive intellectual property rights to MagnaVault. From the initial acquisition date in June 2000, through the MagnaVault \x93end of life\x94 in December\xa02002, we marketed and sold MagnaVault as a stand-alone software\nproduct. MagnaVault revenues ', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'5 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'were flat during the first three quarters of fiscal 2002, with a notable decrease during the fourth quarter of the same fiscal year. Based on\nMagnaVault\x92s results of operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we performed an impairment analysis of the MagnaVault-related goodwill, which resulted in an impairment charge of $2.5 million in the year ended March 31, 2002,\nreflecting the difference between the carrying value and projected discounted future cash flows from the MagnaVault product line. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'During the first two quarters of fiscal 2003, despite our efforts to revitalize MagnaVault\x92s operations by allocating additional resources to\nMagnaVault, total revenues generated from MagnaVault experienced a continued decline. This trend continued into the third quarter of fiscal 2003, and in November 2002, management decided to \x93end of life\x94 the MagnaVault product line,\nwhereby all activities, with the exception of customer support, related to MagnaVault would cease permanently, effective December 31, 2002. In connection with this decision, we terminated several employees and closed our Maryland office facility.\nBased on this triggering event, in accordance with CICA Section 3062, we performed an impairment analysis on the MagnaVault-related goodwill as of December 31, 2002. The first step in the impairment analysis involved comparing the carrying values of\nthe MagnaVault reporting units to their fair values. It was determined that the carrying values of the reporting units exceeded the estimated fair values, consequently, step two of the impairment test was required. As a result of step two, the\nrelated goodwill was deemed impaired and we recognized a charge of $442,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. This charge represented the amount by which the goodwill\x92s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, a component of which\nrelated to the estimated terminal value of the MagnaVault intellectual property (MagnaVault IP). During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we began negotiations with a third party to sell the MagnaVault IP. As of December 31, 2002, it appeared likely\nthat the sale of the MagnaVault IP would be consummated. The negotiations continued into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003; however, as of March 31, 2003, management believed the probability of a successful sale of the MagnaVault IP to the\naforementioned third party to be unlikely. Based on this triggering event, we performed an additional impairment analysis, following the steps outlined above, on the MagnaVault-related goodwill. As a result of the additional analysis, the related\ngoodwill was deemed impaired and we recognized a charge of $446,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. This charge represented the remaining carrying value of the MagnaVault-related goodwill. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Provision for income taxes ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'During the year ended March 31, 2003, we recognized a provision for income\ntaxes related to transactions between our foreign subsidiaries. Certain transactions between our foreign subsidiaries trigger tax liabilities in the respective jurisdictions in which we do business. Income taxes arising out of these transactions\nwere immaterial during the year ended March 31, 2002. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our\noperating results for the year ended March 31, 2002 (restated) compared to the eleven months ended March 31, 2001. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Revenues ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Revenues for the year ended March 31, 2002 were $9.9 million, consisting of $8.1 million in licensing revenues and $1.8 million in service revenues.\nComparatively, revenues for the eleven months ended March 31, 2001 were $5.0 million, consisting of $4.2 million in licensing revenues and $789,000 in service revenues. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Licensing Revenues ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our products are sold almost exclusively through our channel partners, VARs, VADs and OEMs, in three geographic segments: Asia, North America and Europe.\nAsia, North America and Europe contributed $3.7 million, $3.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively, of licensing revenues during the year ended March 31, 2002. During the eleven months ended March 31, 2001, Asia, North America and Europe\ncontributed $2.5 million, $1.3 million and $400,000, respectively. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'6 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'During the year ended March 31, 2002 and the eleven months ended March 31, 2001, our Asian operations\nprovided 46% and 60% of total licensing revenues, respectively. Asian revenues increased $1.2 million, or 48%, in fiscal 2002 due to continued market acceptance of NetVault software in Japan and to expansion into new territories including: China,\nKorea and Vietnam. As of March 31, 2002, these new territories were directed from one office in Tokyo, Japan. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'During the year ended March 31, 2002 and the eleven months ended March 31, 2001, our North American operations provided 37% and 30% of total licensing\nrevenues, respectively. North American licensing revenues increased $1.8 million, or 137%, resulting primarily from the growth in our North American NetVault sales force and the increased market acceptance of NetVault. We began establishing our\npartner channels for NetVault in North America in July 2000 and as of March 31, 2001, we had executed partner agreements with over 50 VAR/VAD partners, and grew the number of VAR/VAD partners to 70 by March 31, 2002. Furthermore, as we first\nintroduced NetVault in North America in August 2000, the year ended March 31, 2002 contained 12 months of NetVault sales, whereas the eleven months ended March 31, 2001 contained only eight months of NetVault sales. Average monthly sales were\n$252,000 and $160,000 for the year ended March 31, 2002 and the eleven months ended March 31, 2001, respectively. The increase in average monthly revenue coincides with the overall revenue growth trend in North America. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'During the year ended March 31, 2002 and the eleven months ended March 31,\n2001, our European operations provided 17% and 10% of total licensing revenues, respectively. These revenues resulted almost entirely from sales of NetVault and were generated from our sales office in Poole, Dorset, United Kingdom. European revenues\nincreased $957,000, or 240%, resulting from increased sales in all regions of Europe, as well as from expansion into Israel and South Africa during the year ended March 31, 2002. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Service Revenues ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'North America, Asia and Europe contributed $1.0 million, $359,000 and $379,000, respectively, for service revenues for the year ended March 31, 2002.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'During the year ended March 31, 2002, service revenues\ngenerated in North America, European and Asian regions were 58%, 22% and 20% of total service revenues, respectively. During the eleven months ended March 31, 2001, service revenues generated in the North America, European and Asian regions were\n40%, 35% and 25%, respectively. The increase noted in North American service revenues as a percent of total service revenues resulted from a combination of the first full year of maintenance services being provided to North American customers and\nthe first maintenance contract renewals. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'As of March 31, 2002,\nNetVault and MagnaVault were supported from our offices in North America, Europe and Asia. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Cost of Revenues ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Cost of revenues totaled $1.2 million and $782,000, or 13% and 16% of total revenues, during the year ended March 31, 2002 and the eleven months ended March 31, 2001, respectively. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The decrease in cost of revenues as a percent of total revenues resulted\nfrom a combination of higher average revenue per client service representative, increased efficiencies in distributing and supporting our software products, and reduced customer service headcount during the year ended March 31, 2002. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Sales and Marketing Expenses ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Sales and marketing expenses totaled $10.8 million and $11.7 million, or 109%\nand 235% of total revenues, during the year ended March 31, 2002 and the eleven months ended March 31, 2001, respectively. Sales and marketing expenses remained relatively consistent between the two periods. However, additional resources were\n', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'7 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'expended during the eleven months ended March 31, 2001 to introduce the NetVault product in North America. Our efforts to introduce NetVault and promote\nMagnaVault in North America during the eleven months ended March 31, 2001 led to substantial spending in advertising and public relations. We engaged in similar activities during the year ended March 31, 2002, albeit to a lesser extent. ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total\nrevenues was primarily a function of revenue growth during the year ended March 31, 2002, as total sales and marketing expenses in dollars remained fairly consistent. Thus, to the extent that revenues increase, we expect that sales and marketing\nexpense will decrease as a percentage of total revenues. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Research and Development Expenses ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Research and development expenses totaled $4.5 million and $3.6 million, or 46% and 72% of total revenues, during the year ended March 31, 2002 and the eleven months ended March 31, 2001, respectively. The decrease in research and\ndevelopment expenses as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to the increase in revenue between the year ended March 31, 2002 and the eleven months ended March 31, 2001. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The increase in total dollars spent on research and development activities during the year ended March\xa031,\xa02002\nwas due to increased average monthly headcount and increased expenditures related to travel, as we increased our focus on sales engineer client site visits during the year ended March 31, 2002. The majority of our engineering efforts are carried out\nin the United States and United Kingdom; these locations are responsible for the ongoing development and testing of our products. Engineering efforts in Japan are minimal and relate to creating functionality and interface capabilities for users in\nthe Asian region. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'General and Administrative Expenses\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'General and administrative expenses totaled $5.4\nmillion and $8.0 million, or 55% and 162% of total revenues, during the year ended March 31, 2002 and the eleven months ended March 31, 2001, respectively. General and administrative expenses consisted primarily of salary and related costs for our\n29 executive and administrative employees throughout our worldwide offices as of March 31, 2002, which decreased from 32 employees as of March 31, 2001. The headcount and expense decrease was partially attributable to the departure from the company\nof several highly compensated individuals. In addition, during the eleven months ended March\xa031, 2001, we incurred higher levels of both computer systems and corporate structure related consulting fees, as well as higher intellectual property\nrelated legal fees than we did during the year ended March 31, 2002. During the eleven months ended March 31, 2001, we implemented a new accounting system and expended significant resources on securing and protecting our intellectual property.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Amortization of Goodwill ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Amortization of goodwill totaled $3.7 million and $3.2 million for the year\nended March 31, 2002 and the eleven months ended March 31, 2001, respectively. The increase in amortization of goodwill was due primarily to the fact that the year ended March 31, 2002 contained 12 months of amortization related to the $8.5 million\nof goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of Tracer in June 2000, where the eleven months ended March 31, 2001 contained only 10 months of amortization. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Impairment of Goodwill ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We recorded goodwill of $8.5 million relating to the acquisition of Tracer in June 2000, $99,000 relating to the 25%\nminority interest acquisition of Tracer KK in January 2002, and $3.1 million relating to the 53% minority interest acquisition of BakBone KK in March of 2002.

MagnaVault revenues were flat during the first three quarters of the year ended March 31, 2002, with a notable decrease during the fourth quarter of\nthe year ended March 31, 2002. Based on MagnaVault\x92s results of operations during the fourth quarter of the year ended March 31, 2002, we performed an impairment analysis of the MagnaVault-related goodwill. As of March 31, 2002, we determined\nthat the carrying value of the MagnaVault-related goodwill exceeded fair value as determined by the estimated discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the underlying assets. Therefore, we recorded an impairment charge of $2.5 million in the\naccompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended March 31, 2002, reflecting the difference between the carrying value and discounted projected future cash flows.

During the year ended March\xa031,\xa02003, we raised gross proceeds of $1.1 million through the private placement of 1,917,788 units at a price of $0.56 per unit. Each unit was\ncomprised of one common share and one-half common share purchase warrant. We also raised $1.3 million during the year ended March 31, 2003, through the exercise of 1,268,747 warrants at a weighted average price of $1.04. During the year ended March\n31, 2002, we raised gross proceeds of $9.7 million through the private placement of 3,000,000 Special Warrants at a price of $3.24 per Special Warrant. Additionally, during the year ended March 31, 2002, we completed a public offering of 7,170,400\nunits at a price of $0.80 per unit for gross proceeds of $5.7 million. Each unit was comprised of one common share and one-quarter common share purchase warrant. During the eleven months ended March 31, 2001, we raised gross proceeds of $4.5 million\nthrough the exercise of 3,694,934 warrants at a weighted average price of $1.23 per warrant, and we entered into a line of credit with a bank that provided us with $2.5 million in net borrowings during the eleven months ended March 31, 2001.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Net cash used in operating activities was $3.1 million and\n$12.7 million during the years ended March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash used in operating activities during the year ended March 31, 2003 included a net loss of $9.4 million, partially offset by non-cash depreciation of $899,000, impairment\nof goodwill of $888,000, amortization of intangible assets of $55,000, stock-based compensation of $536,000 and non-cash special charges of $104,000. Other operating activities that contributed to the use of cash during the year ended March 31, 2003\nincluded increases in accounts receivable of $1.5 million and other assets of $262,000. Operating activities providing sources of cash included increases in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and deferred revenue of $220,000, $1.4 million and\n$4.1 million, respectively. Cash used in operating activities during the year ended March 31, 2002 resulted from a net loss of $18.6 million, partially offset by non-cash depreciation and amortization of $4.6 million and impairment of goodwill of\n$2.5 million. Other operating activities that contributed to the use of cash during the year ended March 31, 2002 included increases in accounts receivable of $1.9 million and other assets of $10,000, and a decrease in accounts payable of $723,000.\nProviding sources of cash were increases in accrued liabilities of $425,000 and deferred revenue of $626,000. The overall decrease in cash used in operating activities of $9.6 million during the year ended March 31, 2003 from the year ended March\n31, 2002, is due primarily to an 82 percent increase in revenues coupled with an operating expense increase of only 16 percent.

', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We currently\nexpect to fund expenditures for capital requirements as well as liquidity needs from a combination of available cash balances, internally generated funds and financing arrangements. We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents will be\nsufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs through the current fiscal year. In fact, the fourth quarter in fiscal 2003 was the first operating cash flow positive quarter in our history. Additionally, we recently entered into a non-binding letter\nof intent with a third party venture capital firm (VC\xa0Firm), pursuant to which we expect to, by way of private placement, issue to the VC Firm an aggregate of approximately 22,000,000 Series A preferred shares at CDN$1.00 per preferred share.\nThe closing of the private placement is not guaranteed by the letter of intent and is subject to requisite regulatory and shareholder approval. However, in the event that the aforementioned private placement does not close and cash generated from\noperations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek additional sources of funding. We are currently a party to a term note with a bank that matures on December 31, 2003. Internally generated funds may not be sufficient to\ncover the Company\x92s liquidity requirements, and in that case, we may be required to obtain additional credit facilities from either our existing credit facility provider or others. Additional debt would result in increased interest expenses and\ncould result in covenants that would restrict our operations. Additionally, a decrease in demand for our products and services could adversely affect our business, which in turn, could adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or obtain access\nto new credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of such facilities. We may also seek additional sources of funding, including the public or private issuance of equity instruments; however, there is no guarantee that such sources\nwill be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if available at all. The sale of additional equity securities would result in immediate and potentially significant dilution to our shareholders. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Estimated future uses of cash in fiscal 2004 include capital expenditures for\nequipment of approximately $525,000. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'At March 31, 2003, we did\nnot have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance\nsheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we did not engage in trading activities involving on-exchange traded contracts. As a result, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk\nthat could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. We do not have relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationship with us or our related parties except as disclosed herein.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Inflation and Changing Prices ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Inflation and changing prices have not had a material impact on our\noperations.

The Company\x92s corporate headquarters is located in San Diego, California. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The Company, formerly Net Resources Incorporated (Net Resources), was\noriginally incorporated in the Canadian Province of British Columbia under the Company Act. In November 1992, the Company continued from British Columbia to the Province of Alberta where it engaged in mineral exploration activities. These\nexploration activities were ceased during 1999 due to declining prices in the mineral markets, and the mining assets were written off. On March 13, 2000, the Company changed its name to BakBone Software Incorporated. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'On March 16, 2000, the Company acquired 100% of NVS Holdings Inc. (NVS). This\nacquisition resulted in a reverse takeover of the Company by NVS as the greater proportion of the voting shares of the Company were held by NVS shareholders after the acquisition. Concurrent with the reverse takeover of the Company, the merged\nentity acquired NetVault Holdings Limited, NetVault Limited and an aggregate 47% of BakBone KK. At the time of this acquisition, NetVault Holdings Limited was a non-operating private shell while NetVault Limited and BakBone KK had substantive\noperations. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'On June 9, 2000, the Company acquired all of the\nissued and outstanding common shares of Tracer Technologies, Inc. and its 50% ownership of the common shares of Tracer Technologies Japan Corporation (collectively Tracer), for cash and acquisition costs totaling $1.6 million (net of cash acquired\nof $800,000) and 600,000 common shares of the Company valued at $6.5 million on the date of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired of $400,000 was $8.5 million. In order to retain certain principals\nof Tracer as employees, the Company issued stock options to acquire 250,000 common shares at an exercise price of $4.06 ($6.00 Canadian) per share. One of the principals is a relative of a former director of the Company and received options to\nacquire 62,500 common shares. The former director also indirectly received 3,060 common shares of the Company through his ownership in Tracer Technologies Japan Corporation (Tracer KK), one of the former shareholders of Tracer. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In January 2002, the Company acquired an additional 25% of Tracer KK in\nexchange for $100,000 in cash and contingent consideration, consisting of $100,000 in cash and 30,000 shares of the Company\x92s common stock. The $100,000 in cash was paid in fiscal 2003; however, as specific milestones were not met, the 30,000\nshares of the Company\x92s common stock were never issued. The excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired was $99,000. In March 2002, the company acquired the remaining 25% of Tracer KK for nominal consideration. Both\nacquisitions were accounted for by the purchase method of accounting. Following the March 2002 acquisition, Tracer KK became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In March 2002, the Company acquired the remaining 53% of BakBone KK for 2,100,000 common shares of the Company, valued at\n$2.9 million at the time of acquisition, and $170,000 in cash. The 2,100,000 shares were issued and the $170,000 was paid during fiscal 2003. The acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting and the excess of purchase price\nover the fair value of the net assets acquired was $3.1 million. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'During fiscal 2003, the Company executed two intercompany mergers in order to simplify its corporate structure. These transactions reduced the number of BakBone wholly owned subsidiaries from two to one, in both Asia and Europe. The\ntransactions had no effect on the consolidated financial statements.

As the minority interest parties were not\nlegally liable to fund BakBone KK and Tracer KK\x92s net losses, the Company did not record their minority interest share of BakBone KK and Tracer KK\x92s net losses to the extent it would result in a minority interest receivable.

The transitional impairment test was completed as of April 1, 2002, and resulted in no indication of impairment. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment during the first quarter of\neach fiscal year or when an event or a change in facts and circumstances indicates the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying amount. Events or changes in facts and circumstances that we consider as impairment indicators include\nthe following: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'significant underperformance of its business relative to expected operating results; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'significant adverse economic and industry trends; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'significant decline in stock price; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'significant decline in revenues; and ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'expectations that a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The annual goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process as follows: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Step 1.', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Company compares the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying amount, including any existing\ngoodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit\x92s goodwill may be impaired and the Company then performs the second step of the impairment test. If the fair value of the\nreporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further analysis is required. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Step 2.', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The Company compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit\x92s goodwill, determined by allocating the reporting unit\x92s fair value to all of its assets and its\nliabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit\x92s goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'(f) Revenue Recognition ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The Company recognizes software license revenue upon delivery, provided all\nsignificant obligations have been met, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, fees are fixed and determinable, collections are probable, and the Company is not involved in significant production, customization, or modification of the software\nor services that are essential to the functionality of the software. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The Company licenses software to resellers in arrangements under which they purchase a combination of software, post-contractual support and/or professional services (collectively \x93multiple element arrangements\x94). Post-contractual\nsupport includes rights to unspecified upgrades and enhancements, and telephone support. Professional services relate to implementation services and training. For these types of arrangements, the Company has established vendor specific objective\nevidence, or VSOE, of fair value for all elements in the multiple element arrangement, and thus, revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements. VSOE of fair value is established by the price charged\nwhen the same element is sold separately. The Company determines VSOE of fair value of post-contractual support based on substantive renewal rates for the same term post-contractual support.

Certain OEM arrangements involve multiple elements where VSOE of fair value exists for all undelivered elements but VSOE of fair value does not exist for one or more delivered elements. Under these\narrangements revenue is recognized using the residual method, whereby, the fair value of undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue, assuming delivery has occurred and collectibility is\nprobable. Revenue allocated to post-contractual support is recognized ratably over the arrangement period, which is generally one year. One OEM customer has a specific right of return, whereby the customer is contractually permitted to return the\nCompany\x92s product during the arrangement period. The Company uses historical returns experience with this customer to estimate potential returns and to establish the appropriate sales returns allowance. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company entered into a multiple\nelement arrangement with an OEM customer under which, in addition to providing software licenses and maintenance services, the Company made a commitment to the customer to provide unspecified future software products. As VSOE of fair value cannot be\ndetermined for the unspecified future software products, all sales amounts procured under this arrangement is initially deferred and subsequently recognized ratably over the arrangement period. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'(g) Cost of Revenue ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Cost of revenue includes material, packaging, shipping and other production\ncosts. Cost of revenue also includes salaries, benefits and overhead costs associated with employees providing support services. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'(h) Product Development Costs ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Product development costs related to research, design and development of software applications are charged to expense as incurred. To date, completion of\nworking models of the Company\x92s applications and the general release of the products have substantially coincided. As a result, the Company has not capitalized any application development costs as such costs have been insignificant. ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'(i) Loss per Share ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Basic earnings or loss per share is calculated using the weighted-average\nnumber of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings or loss per share is calculated similar to basic earnings or loss per share except that the weighted-average shares outstanding are increased to include additional shares from the assumed\nexercise of potential common shares, if dilutive. For the years ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 and the eleven months ended March 31, 2001, 4,878,147, 4,962,725, and 5,986,703 potential common shares, respectively, were excluded from the computations\nof diluted loss per share as their effect was anti-dilutive. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'(j) Stock-Based Compensation ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Effective\nApril 1, 2002, the Company adopted the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants Handbook Section 3870, ', u'Stock-based Compensation and Other Stock-based Payments ', u'(CICA Section 3870), under which the Company is required to apply a fair\nvalue-based method of accounting for all stock-based payments issued to non-employees and to all direct awards of stock to employees. The Company will continue to use settlement date accounting to account for employee stock options, whereby the\nCompany does not record stock-based compensation for stock options granted to employees.

In preparing the consolidated financial\nstatements, the Company estimates its income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates by estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for\ntax and financial statement purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of the Company\x92s deferred tax assets. In performing this\nassessment, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income\nduring the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. In the event\nthat actual results differ from the estimates or the Company adjusts its estimates in future periods, the Company may need to reduce the valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations. ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'(l) Financial Instruments and Market Risk ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts\npayable, accrued liabilities, notes payable and loans from related parties constitute financial instruments. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their fair value\ngiven the relatively short periods to maturity. The carrying value of notes payable approximates its fair value because its interest rates and other terms are comparable to those currently available to the Company in the marketplace. The fair value\nof loans from related parties cannot be ascertained due to the related party nature of the debt. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The Company is exposed to the risks that arise from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the volatility of those rates. The Company does not use\nderivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'During the year ended March 31, 2003, one customer represented approximately 16% of total revenues. During the year ended March 31, 2002 and the eleven months ended March 31, 2001, no single customer represented more\nthan 10% of total revenues. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The Company maintains an allowance\nfor doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments, which results in a provision for bad debt expense. The Company determines the adequacy of this allowance by evaluating individual\ncustomer accounts receivable, considering the customer\x92s financial condition, credit history and current economic conditions. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'(m) Use of Estimates ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in Canada requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the\nreporting periods.

The first step of\nthe transitional goodwill impairment test required the Company to determine and compare the fair value of its defined reporting units to their carrying values as of April 1, 2002. The fair value of each reporting unit was determined using a\ndiscounted cash flow valuation analysis. The carrying value of each reporting unit was determined by specifically identifying and allocating the assets and liabilities of BakBone to each reporting unit based on headcount, relative revenues, or other\nmethods as deemed appropriate by management. The Company believes that the assumptions made for these analyses are reasonable and consistent. The estimated fair values exceeded the carrying values for each reporting unit, resulting in no indication\nof impairment. Consequently, the second step of the impairment test was not required. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'During the first two quarters of fiscal 2003, total revenues generated by MagnaVault, the Company\x92s comprehensive secondary storage archival storage management software for UNIX and Linux host operating\nenvironments, experienced a significant decline. This trend continued into the third quarter of fiscal 2003, and in November 2002, the Company decided to \x93end of life\x94 the MagnaVault product, whereby all activities, with the exception of\ncustomer support, related to MagnaVault would cease permanently, effective December 31, 2002. In connection with this decision, the Company terminated several employees and closed its Maryland office facility. Based on this triggering event, in\naccordance with CICA Section 3062, the Company was required to perform an impairment analysis on the MagnaVault-related goodwill as of December 31, 2002. The first step in the impairment analysis involved comparing the carrying values of the\nMagnaVault reporting units to their fair values. It was determined that the carrying values of the reporting units exceeded the estimated fair values, and consequently, step two of the impairment test was required. As a result of step two, the\nrelated goodwill was deemed impaired and the Company recognized a charge of $442,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. The charge represented the amount by which the goodwill\x92s carrying value exceeded its estimated fair value, a component of\nwhich related to the estimated terminal value of the MagnaVault intellectual property (MagnaVault IP). During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company began negotiations with a third party to sell the MagnaVault IP. As of December 31, 2002, it\nappeared likely that the sale of the MagnaVault IP would be consummated. The negotiations continued into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003; however, as of March 31, 2003, management believed the probability of a successful sale of the MagnaVault IP\nto the aforementioned third party ', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'29 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'BAKBONE SOFTWARE INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\x97(Continued)\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'March 31, 2003 and 2002 ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'(in U.S. dollars) ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'to be unlikely.

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more\nlikely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of deferred taxable income during the periods in which those temporary\ndifferences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected deferred taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical operating results and\nprojections of deferred taxable income, management has determined that it is more likely than not that the portion of deferred tax assets not utilized through the reversal of deferred tax liabilities will not be realized.

Additionally, statements concerning future matters such as the\ndevelopment of new products, enhancements or technologies, sales levels, expense levels and other statements regarding matters that are not historical are forward-looking statements. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Although forward-looking statements in this report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, we can only base such\nstatements on facts and factors that we currently know. Consequently, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, the risks described in the Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this\nreport. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in or anticipated by the forward-looking statements. We urge you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as\nof the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements in order to reflect any events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this report. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the\nunaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in this interim report and the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our revised Annual Report for the year ended March\xa031,\n2003. All amounts are expressed in United States dollars unless otherwise noted. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In connection with the preparation of our fiscal 2004 annual results, we determined that our previously published financial statements reflected errors in fiscal 2002 and 2003, and the first three quarters of fiscal\n2004. Most notably, the financial statements for the first three quarters of fiscal 2004 did not properly reflect the appropriate revenue recognition for certain customer arrangements. Several additional adjustments were also identified. The\nfinancial statements included in this quarterly report as of and for the three months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 reflect the appropriate characterization for certain customer arrangements and other noted adjustments. The restatement adjustments\nhave no impact on the net cash flows of the Company. Investors should rely solely on the financial data in this quarterly report, and not on previously published quarterly results. A complete discussion of the restated financial data is included in\nNote 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report.

Our corporate headquarters are located in\nSan Diego, California. This facility houses executive management as well as sales, marketing, customer support and administrative departments. We maintain offices in Tokyo, Japan and Poole, Dorset, United Kingdom, whose primary activities surround\nthe sales, marketing and administrative functions for the Pacific Rim and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) regions, respectively. In addition, our United Kingdom and San Diego offices include engineering personnel responsible for the\ndevelopment effort of our NetVault core and NetVault Application Plug-in Module (APM) software products, respectively. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Critical Accounting Policies ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Canada, which conform to\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States, except as discussed in Note 17 to the audited consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Information Form for the year ended March 31, 2003, as amended by our Annual\nInformation Form for the year ended March 31, 2004. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'1 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'The preparation of our financial statements requires BakBone to make estimates and judgments that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, BakBone evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for\ndoubtful accounts, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and valuation of goodwill. BakBone bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results\nof which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We believe there are several accounting policies that are critical to\nunderstanding our historical and future performance, as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve management\x92s judgments and estimates. These significant accounting policies are: ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'revenue recognition; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'allowance for doubtful accounts; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'valuation allowance for deferred tax assets; and ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'valuation of goodwill. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'These policies, and our procedures related to these policies, are described below. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Revenue recognition ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We recognize software license revenue upon delivery, provided all significant obligations have been met, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,\nfees are fixed and determinable, collections are probable, and we are not involved in significant production, customization, or modification of the software or services that are essential to the functionality of the software. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We license software and provide maintenance services to two distinct groups\nof customers: resellers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). We license software to resellers in arrangements under which they purchase a combination of software, post-contractual support and/or professional services (collectively\n\x93multiple element arrangements\x94). Post-contractual support includes rights to unspecified upgrades and enhancements, and telephone support. Professional services relate to implementation services and training. For these types of\narrangements, we have established vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value for all elements in the multiple element arrangement, and thus, revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the\nelements. VSOE of fair value is established by the price charged when the same element is sold separately. We determine VSOE of fair value of post-contractual support based on substantive renewal rates for the same term post-contractual support.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We also license software under several OEM agreements, which\nare segregated into two categories for revenue recognition purposes. Certain OEM arrangements involve multiple elements where VSOE of fair value exists for all undelivered elements but VSOE of fair value does not exist for one or more delivered\nelements. Under these arrangements revenue is recognized using the residual method, whereby, the fair value of undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue, assuming delivery has occurred\nand collectibility is probable. Revenue allocated to post-contractual support is recognized ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. One OEM customer has a specific right of return, whereby the customer is contractually\npermitted to return our product during the arrangement period. We use historical returns experience with this customer to estimate potential returns and to establish the appropriate sales returns allowance. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We have also entered into multiple element arrangements with certain OEM\ncustomers under which, in addition to providing software licenses and maintenance services, we make a commitment to the customer to ', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'2 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'provide unspecified future software products. As VSOE of fair value cannot be determined for the unspecified future software products, all sales amounts\nprocured under these arrangements are initially deferred and subsequently recognized ratably over the arrangement period. Revenue recognized under these arrangements is included under \x93Development Software Solutions\x94 in Note 6 to the\nconsolidated financial statements. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We have standard payment\nterms, which we offer to all of our customers, and we do not offer any extended payment terms. In addition, our sales agreements do not contain stock balancing rotation rights. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Allowance for doubtful accounts ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make\nrequired payments, which results in a provision for bad debt expense. We determine the adequacy of this allowance by evaluating individual customer accounts receivable, considering the customer\x92s financial condition, credit history and current\neconomic conditions. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate by estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and\nliabilities. Significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. In performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets\nwill not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred\ntax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods, we may need to reduce our valuation\nallowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Valuation of goodwill ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We have recorded goodwill in connection with the acquisitions we have completed in prior periods. As of April 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) Handbook Section 3062, ', u'Goodwill\nand Other Intangible Assets ', u'(CICA Section 3062), and accordingly, ceased amortization of goodwill and performed the transitional impairment test prescribed by CICA Section 3062. We review our goodwill for impairment during the first quarter of\neach fiscal year or when an event or a change in facts and circumstances indicates the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying amount. Events or changes in facts and circumstances that we consider as impairment indicators include\nthe following: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'significant underperformance of our business relative to expected operating results; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'significant adverse economic and industry trends; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'significant decline in stock price; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'significant decline in revenues; and ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'expectations that a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'3 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'The annual goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process as follows: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Step 1.', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We compare the fair value of each\nreporting unit to its carrying amount, including the existing goodwill. If the carrying amount of each reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that each reporting unit\x92s goodwill may be impaired and we then perform the\nsecond step of the impairment test. If the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further analysis is required. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Step 2.', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We compare the implied fair value of each reporting unit\x92s goodwill, determined by allocating each reporting\nunit\x92s fair value to all of its assets and its liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of each reporting unit\x92s goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will\nbe recognized in an amount equal to that excess. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Results of Operations\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Investors should rely solely on the financial\nstatements in this quarterly report and not on previously published quarterly results. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Three Months Ended June 30, 2003 (restated) Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2002 (restated). ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Revenues ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Revenues increased 54%, to $5.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003, from $3.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2002. Revenues for\nthe three months ended June 30, 2003 consisted of $4.5 million in licensing revenues, $1.0 million in service revenues, and $13,000 in development software solutions revenues compared to revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2002, which\nconsisted of $3.1 million in licensing revenues and $526,000 in service revenues. We generated no development software solutions revenues during the three months ended June 30, 2002. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In November 2002, we decided to discontinue the MagnaVault product line, effective January 1, 2003. The three months ended\nJune 30, 2002 included MagnaVault licensing and service revenues of $164,000 and $138,000, respectively. During the three months ended June 30, 2003, MagnaVault licensing revenues were immaterial and service revenues approximated $93,000. We do not\nexpect to generate material revenues from this discontinued product line in the future. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Licensing Revenues ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our products are sold almost exclusively through our channel partners, value added resellers (VARs), value added distributors (VADs) and OEMs, in three geographic segments: North America, the Pacific Rim and EMEA. Fiscal 2003 experienced\nsignificant growth in OEM revenues worldwide, as prior to fiscal 2003, OEM revenues were not significant. During the three months ended June 30, 2003, substantially all of our OEM revenues were derived from our worldwide relationship with NCR\nTeradata (NCR). ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In North America, licensing revenues for the\nthree months ended June 30, 2003 increased 44% to $1.9 million, from $1.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2002. Licensing revenues growth in North America was driven by the reseller channel. During the three months ended June 30, 2003,\nwe continued to establish new reseller relationships, while leveraging existing relationships to grow revenues through the reseller channel. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In the Pacific Rim, licensing revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2003 increased 21% to $1.5 million, from $1.3 million for the three months\nended June 30, 2002. The Pacific Rim grew licensing revenues through the reseller channel, as OEM licensing revenues declined slightly. During fiscal 2003, the Pacific Rim expanded its business operations into new territories, including China and\nKorea. The prior year\x92s expansion contributed to the increase in licensing revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'4 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'In EMEA, licensing revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2003 increased 120% to $1.1 million, from\n$509,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2002. EMEA grew licensing revenues through both the reseller and OEM channels. The growth in OEM licensing revenues was due to the strength of our worldwide relationship with NCR, who accounted for a\nmajority of EMEA\x92s OEM licensing revenues during the three months ended June 30, 2003. Increased sales to existing resellers, supplemented by sales to new resellers, also helped to drive licensing revenues higher. Furthermore, licensing\nrevenues increased due to the expansion of our operations in EMEA during the three months ended June 30, 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Service Revenues ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Service revenues consist principally of maintenance revenues derived from the sale of customer support contracts. These contract fees generally\napproximate 20% of the licensing fee. Revenues from customer support contracts are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, generally one year. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In North America, service revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2003 increased 71% to $557,000, from $326,000 for the\nthree months ended June 30, 2002. In the Pacific Rim, service revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2003 grew 165% to $236,000, from $89,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2002. In EMEA, service revenues for the three months ended June\n30, 2003 increased 94% to $215,000, from $111,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2002. The worldwide growth in service revenues is directly related to increased licensing revenues from sales to new customers and to maintenance contract renewals\nfrom existing customers. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Development Software Solutions\nRevenues ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We have entered into multiple element\narrangements with certain OEM customers under which, in addition to providing software licenses and maintenance services, we make a commitment to the customer to provide unspecified future software products. As VSOE of fair value cannot be\ndetermined for the unspecified future software products, all sales amounts procured under these arrangements are initially deferred and subsequently recognized ratably over the arrangement period. Revenue recognized under these arrangements is\nincluded under \x93Development Software Solutions\x94 in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. We recognized $13,000 in Development Software Solutions revenues during the three months ended June 30, 2003. We did not recognize any such\nrevenues during the three months ended June 30, 2002. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Cost of Revenues ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Cost of revenues for\nthe three months ended June 30, 2003 totaled $796,000 with a gross margin of 86%, compared with cost of revenues of $321,000 with a gross margin of 91% for the three months ended June 30, 2002. These costs consisted of the direct cost of providing\ncustomer support, including salary and benefits of staff working in our customer support departments, as well as associated costs of computer equipment, telephone and other general costs necessary to maintain customer support for our end users. Also\nincluded in cost of revenues are software license royalties and the direct costs of raw materials and packaging for products shipped to customers. The direct costs of raw materials and packaging are nominal as products shipped to customers consist\nof a CD, manual, printed box and other media. Product costs for these items individually and in aggregate are minimal and we have little risk of inventory obsolescence due to the small quantities of these items needed to fill our customers\x92\norders and the short lead time to acquire additional materials. Raw material purchases are held in inventory until the sale of the related software product at which time the cost per unit sold is released to cost of revenues. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The increase in cost of revenues in absolute dollars was due to the overall\nincrease in sales volume and to software license royalties associated with the development software solutions arrangements. Although we are required to defer the total arrangement value and recognize the related revenue over the arrangement period,\n', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'5 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'third-party software license royalties are due upon our procurement of license sales. During the three months ended June 30, 2003, we recognized\napproximately $163,000 in software license royalties paid to third party software vendors. The increase in cost of revenues as a percent of total revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2003 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2002 was\ndue primarily to additional customer support headcount and to timing differences between the recognition of development software solutions revenues and related third-party royalties. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Sales and Marketing Expenses ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll, commission, marketing, and travel costs for our worldwide sales\nstaff. Sales and marketing expenses increased $424,000, or 14%, to $3.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003, from $3.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2002. The increase was attributed primarily to increases in headcount and\nperformance-based payments, which consisted principally of commissions and bonuses. Headcount increased primarily in the Pacific Rim and EMEA, as we expanded our operations in those regions during fiscal 2003 and the first quarter of fiscal 2004.\nThe increase in performance-based payments was a direct function of revenue growth during the three months ended June 30, 2003. Also contributing to the increase in sales and marketing expenses were travel, advertising and promotional costs\nsurrounding the introduction of new products, most notably NetVault 7.0. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2003 decreased to 65%, from 88% for the three months ended June 30, 2002. The decrease was due primarily to the\nincrease in total revenues. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Research and Development\nExpenses ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Research and development expenses consist\nprimarily of salary and related costs for our worldwide engineering staff. Research and development expenses decreased $115,000, or 9%, to $1.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003, from $1.2 million for the three months ended June 30,\n2002. The overall decrease was due primarily to a reduction in headcount surrounding the November 2002 decision to \x93end of life\x94 the MagnaVault product line. While the Company has made recent research and development hires, research and\ndevelopment headcount as of June 30, 2002 exceeded that as of June 30, 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2003 decreased to 20%, from 35% for the three months ended June 30, 2002. The decrease was due primarily to the\nincrease in total revenues. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'General and Administrative\nExpenses ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'General and administrative expenses include\nsalaries and benefits for our corporate personnel and other expenses, such as facilities costs and professional services. General and administrative expenses remained constant between the three months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002. We incurred a\nslight increase in general and administrative expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2003 related to increases in corporate governance, public reporting and insurance costs. These increases were offset by a decrease in legal expenses during\nthe three months ended June 30, 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'General and\nadministrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2003 decreased to 26%, from 41% for the three months ended June 30, 2002. The decrease was due primarily to the increase in total revenues. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Stock-based Compensation ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Effective April 1, 2002, we adopted the CICA Handbook Section 3870,\n', u'Stock-based Compensation and Other Stock-based Payments ', u'(CICA Section 3870), under which we are required to apply a fair value-based method of accounting for all stock-based payments issued to non-employees and all direct awards of stock to\nemployees. We continue to use settlement date accounting to account for employee stock options. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'6 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'During the three months ended June 30, 2002, we recognized $451,000 in stock-based compensation expense\nin connection with the issuance of certain equity instruments to non-employees for services they rendered to us. The fair value of these equity instruments was calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and was recorded as stock-based\ncompensation expense during the three months ended June 30, 2002. No such charges were incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Provision for income taxes ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'During the three months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002, we recognized provisions for income taxes of $128,000 and $22,000, respectively. During the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2003 and 2002, certain transactions between our foreign subsidiaries triggered tax liabilities for $76,000 and $22,000, respectively, in the respective jurisdictions in which we do business. Furthermore, we recognized a\nprovision for income taxes of $52,000 during the three months ended June 30, 2003 related to taxable income generated during the period.

Most recently, in July 2003, we raised proceeds of approximately $13.7 million, net of approximately $2.0 million in offering costs,\nthrough the issuance of 22,000,000 Series A Preferred Shares at CDN$1.00 per Preferred Share. These proceeds are not included in the balance of cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'As of June 30, 2003, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.0 million\ncompared to $5.0 million as of March 31, 2003, a decrease of $1.0 million. Net cash used in operating activities was $804,000 and $2.0 million during the three months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash used in operating activities\nduring the three months ended June 30, 2003 resulted from a net loss of $1.6 million, partially offset by non-cash depreciation and amortization of $224,000. Operating activities that contributed to the use of cash during the three months ended June\n30, 2003 included increases in accounts receivable of $380,000 and other assets of $22,000, and a decrease in accrued liabilities of $86,000. Operating activities providing cash were an increase to accounts payable of $36,000 and an increase to\ndeferred revenues of $1.0 million. Cash used in operating activities during the three months ended June 30, 2002 resulted from a net loss of $3.1 million, partially offset by non-cash depreciation and amortization of $236,000 and stock-based\ncompensation of $451,000. Other operating activities that contributed to the use of cash during the three months ended June 30, 2002 included increases in accounts receivable of $136,000 and other assets of $84,000. Providing sources of cash were\nincreases in accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and deferred revenue of $183,000, $284,000, and $218,000, respectively. The overall decrease in cash used in operating activities of $1.1 million during the three months ended June 30, 2003 from\nthe three months ended June 30, 2002, is due primarily to the combination of significant revenue growth with only moderate increases in operating expenses. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Net cash used in investing activities was $178,000 and $86,000 during the three months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Cash provided by\nfinancing activities during the three months ended June 30, 2002 consisted primarily of gross proceeds from the exercise of warrants of $1.3 million, which was offset partially by $46,000 in capital lease payments and $187,000 in payments on a note\npayable. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We currently expect to fund expenditures for capital\nrequirements, as well as liquidity needs from a combination of available cash balances, internally generated funds and financing arrangements. We believe that cash and cash equivalents existing as of June 30, 2003 will be sufficient to meet our\nanticipated cash needs through the next twelve months. However, internally generated funds, when combined with proceeds from the aforementioned financing, may not be sufficient to cover our liquidity requirements in future fiscal years, and in that\ncase, we may be required to obtain additional credit facilities. Additional debt would result in increased interest expenses and could result in covenants that would restrict our operations. Additionally, a decrease in demand for our products and\nservices could adversely affect our business, which in turn, could adversely affect our ability to obtain access to new credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of such facilities. We may also seek additional sources of funding,\nincluding the public or private issuance of equity instruments; however, there is no guarantee that such sources will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if available at all. The sale of additional equity securities would result in\nimmediate and potentially significant dilution to our shareholders.

In addition, we did not engage in trading activities involving on-exchange traded contracts. As a result, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that\ncould arise if we had engaged in such relationships.

The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial\nmay also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business and financial results could be harmed. In that case the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also refer to the other\ninformation set forth in this report, including our financial statements and the accompanying notes. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Competition in our target markets could reduce our sales on several fronts. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We have a number of competitors in our target markets. If existing or new competitors gain market share, our business and\noperating results could be adversely affected. Many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do in the areas of sales, marketing and product development and we expect to face additional competition from these competitors in the\nfuture. Our existing and future competitors could introduce products with superior features, scalability and functionality at lower prices than our products. Our competitors could gain market share by bundling existing or new products with other\nmore established products or by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our other competitors. If our competitors are successful in gaining market share, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our revenues will decline significantly if the market\ndoes not continue to accept our NetVault product. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We\nderive substantially all of our licensing revenues from our NetVault product. We currently expect to continue to derive substantially all of our revenues from this product. If the market does not continue to accept this product, our revenues will\ndecline significantly, and this would negatively affect our operating results. Factors that may affect the market acceptance of our NetVault product include the performance, price and total cost of ownership of our product and the availability,\nfunctionality and price of competing products and technologies. Many of these factors are beyond our control. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We derive a significant amount of revenues from only a few customers. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We have derived, and believe we will continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of\ncustomers. Most notably, one customer accounted for approximately 17% of consolidated revenues during the three months ended June 30, 2003. Many of our key customers have recently announced that their own businesses are slowing, which could\nadversely affect their demand for our products. If any of our largest customers were to reduce purchases from us, our business would be adversely affected. In addition, we do not have contracts with our key customers that require such customers to\npurchase a specified number of software licenses from us. Therefore, we cannot be sure that these customers will continue to purchase our products at current levels. As a result, a significant reseller in one period may decide not to purchase our\nproduct in a subsequent period, which would have an adverse impact on our revenues. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'10 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Failure to manage our growth could adversely affect our business. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business and operating\nresults could be adversely affected, which could cause the market price of our stock to fall. We expect to continue to grow our operations domestically and internationally, and to hire additional employees. The growth in our operations and staff has\nplaced, and will continue to place, a significant strain on our management systems and resources. If we fail to manage our future anticipated growth, we may experience higher operating expenses, and we may be unable to meet the expectations of\nsecurities analysts or investors with respect to future operating results. To manage this growth we must continue to: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'improve our financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'add and integrate new employees; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'control expenses; and ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'integrate geographically dispersed operations. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We have committed a significant amount of funds to obtaining additional systems and facilities to accommodate our current and future anticipated growth.\nTo the extent that this anticipated growth does not occur or occurs more slowly than we anticipate, we may not be able to reduce expenses to the same degree. Any failure to manage our growth effectively could seriously harm our business and\noperating results. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Inability to protect our technologies\ncould affect our ability to compete. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We may receive\nclaims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. As the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products continue to overlap, we become increasingly susceptible to infringement\nclaims, including patent, trademark and copyright infringement claims. In addition, past employers of former, current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary\ninformation of these former employers. Any such claim, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management\x92s attention from our core business, require us to stop selling or delay shipping our\nproduct, or cause the redesign of our product. In addition, we may be required to pay monetary amounts as damages, for royalty or licensing arrangements, or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers. ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We license and use software from third parties in our business. These\nthird party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms. Also, these third parties may from time to time receive claims that they have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, including patent and\ncopyright infringement claims, which may affect our ability to continue licensing this software. Our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business, which could materially and\nadversely affect our operating results. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Inability to\nprotect our proprietary information will adversely affect our business. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other measures to protect our proprietary information. All of these measures afford only\nlimited protection. These measures may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged, and others may develop technologies or processes that are similar or superior to our technology. We license some of our products under \x93shrink wrap\x94 license\nagreements that do not require a physical signature by the end user licensee and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy our\nproducts or to obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'11 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Our products have a short product life cycle. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Software products typically have a limited life cycle and it is difficult to\nestimate when they will become obsolete. We must therefore continually develop and introduce innovative new products and/or upgraded versions of our existing products before the current software has completed its life cycle. If we are unable to keep\npace with the need to supply new products, we may not be able to achieve and sustain the level of sales required for success. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our foreign operations and sales create unique challenges that could adversely affect our operating results. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'An investment in our securities involves greater risk than an investment in\nmany other businesses because we have significant operations outside of the United States, including engineering, sales and client services, and we plan to expand these international operations. As of June 30, 2003, we had 45 employees in EMEA and\n36 employees in the Pacific Rim. Our foreign operations are subject to a number of risks, including: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy, misappropriation or weaker laws regarding intellectual property protection; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'the impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS); ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'imposition of foreign laws and other governmental controls, including trade restrictions; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'unexpected domestic and international political or regulatory changes; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic instability such as higher interest rates and inflation, which could reduce our customers\x92 ability to obtain financing for\nsoftware products or which could make our product more expensive in those countries; and ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'difficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations.

', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We rely on competing equipment manufacturers as a material source of revenues. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'A portion of our revenues comes from our OEMs that incorporate our storage management software into their hardware solution.\nRisks associated with our OEM customers include: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'we have no control over the shipping dates or volumes of systems they ship; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'they have no obligation to recommend or offer our software products; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'they may generally have no minimum sales requirements and can terminate our relationship at any time or upon short notice; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'they could choose to develop their own data availability products and incorporate those products into their systems instead of our products; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'they could develop enhancements to and derivative products from our products; and ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'they could change their own base products, which could make it difficult for us to adapt our products to theirs. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Finally, our OEM customers compete with one another. If one of our OEM\ncustomers views the products we have developed for another OEM as competing with its products, it might decide to stop doing business with us, which could adversely affect our business and our operating results. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'12 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Our success depends on our ability to develop new and enhanced products that achieve widespread\nmarket acceptance.

In order to grow our business, we are committing substantial resources to develop software products and services for the SAN (Storage Area Network) market and the NAS (Network Attached\nStorage) market. Each of these markets is new and industry standards for these markets are evolving and changing. If these markets do not develop as anticipated, or demand for our products in these markets fails to materialize or occurs more slowly\nthan we expect, we will have expended substantial resources and capital without realizing sufficient revenue, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our quarterly revenues may fluctuate significantly, which could cause the market price of our stock to be extremely\nvolatile. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We may experience a shortfall in revenues in\nany given quarter in relation to our plans or investor expectations. Any such shortfall in revenues could cause the market price of our stock to fall substantially. Our revenues in general, and our licensing revenues in particular, are difficult to\nforecast and are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'the timing and magnitude of sales through our OEM customers; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'the introduction, timing and market acceptance of new products; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'the rate of adoption of NAS and SAN technologies and the timing and magnitude of sales of our products and services for these markets; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'the extent to which our customers renew their maintenance contracts with us; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'changes in our pricing policies and distribution terms; and ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'the possibility that our customers may defer purchases in anticipation of new products or product updates by us or by our competitors. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'You should not rely on the results of any prior periods as an indication of\nour future performance. If we have a shortfall in revenues in any given quarter, our efforts to reduce our operating expenses in response will likely lag behind the revenues shortfall. Therefore, any significant shortfall in revenues will likely\nhave an immediate adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Existing strategic alliances may be terminated and we may be unable to develop new relationships. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our growth and marketing strategies are based, in part, on seeking out and forming strategic alliances with third-party suppliers, VARs, VADs, OEMs and\nother businesses integral to our future success. None of our channel partners or OEMs has any obligation to continue selling our products and any of them may terminate their relationship with us at any time. We cannot assure you that existing\nstrategic alliances will not be terminated or modified in the future nor can we assure you that we will be able to develop new relationships. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'A portion of our revenues comes from OEM sales that incorporate our storage management software into the OEM hardware solution. We have no control over\nthe shipping dates or volumes of systems the OEMs ship and they have no obligation to ship systems incorporating our software. They also have no obligation to recommend or offer our software products exclusively or at all. These OEMs also could\nchoose to bundle competitors\x92 products in lieu of our product. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'13 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'We expect a large portion of our revenues will come from our channel partners across the world. These\npartners have no obligation to establish a sales relationship or to continue selling any of our products and may terminate the relationship with us at any time upon written notice as described in the related channel partner agreements. ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our products may contain significant defects, which may result in\nliability and/or decreased sales. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Software products\nfrequently contain errors or failures, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. Despite our efforts to test our products, we might experience significant errors or failures in our products, or they might not work with\nother hardware or software as expected, which could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and adversely affect market acceptance of our products. End-user customers use our products for applications that are\ncritical to their businesses, and they have a greater sensitivity to product defects than the market for other software products generally. Our customers may claim that we are responsible for damages to the extent they are harmed by the failure of\nany of our products. If we were to experience significant delays in the release of new products or new versions of products, or if customers were dissatisfied with product functionality or performance, we could lose revenue or be subject to\nliability for service or warranty costs, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We may require additional capital and raising such capital will dilute our shareholders\x92 ownership interest in us. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We may need to raise additional funds from lenders and/or equity markets. In\nJuly 2003, we raised proceeds of approximately $13.7 million, net of approximately $2.0 million in offering costs, through the issuance of 22,000,000 Series A Preferred Shares at CDN$1.00 per Preferred Share. However, internally generated funds,\nwhen combined with the aforementioned proceeds, may not be sufficient to cover our liquidity requirements, and in that case, we may require additional capital. In the case that we do require additional capital, we cannot assure you that we will be\nsuccessful in our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms satisfactory to us or at all. If we raise additional capital or arrange for debt financing through mechanisms, which involve additional issuance of our stock, control of the Company\nmay change and shareholders will experience dilution to their equity interests in the Company. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Evolving regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses and continuing uncertainty. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and new SEC regulations are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours. These new or changed securities laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of\nspecificity. As a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by\nongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving securities laws, regulations\nand standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new or changed\nsecurities laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, our reputation may be harmed. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'14 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'We may be unable to hire and retain qualified employees. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our future growth and success depends on our ability to hire and retain\nqualified employees as needed, and to manage our employee base effectively. If we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees, our business and operating results may be adversely affected. We need to hire and retain sales, technical, and\nmanagement personnel to support the planned expansion of our business and to meet the anticipated increased customer demand for our products and services. Competition for people with the skills we require is intense, particularly in the San Diego\narea where our headquarters is located, and the high cost of living in this area makes our recruiting and compensation costs higher. As a result, we expect to continue to experience increases in compensation costs. We cannot assure you that we will\nbe successful in hiring or retaining new personnel. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Inflation and Changing\nPrices ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Inflation and changing prices have not had a\nmaterial impact on our operations. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Foreign Currency ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our revenues result mainly from sales made in United States dollars, British\npounds, Euros and Japanese yen. We will continue to incur operating costs mainly in United States dollars, British pounds, Japanese yen and, to a lesser extent, Euros and Canadian dollars. Thus, our operations are susceptible to fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates. We do not currently engage in hedging or other activities to reduce exchange rate risk but may do so in the future, if conditions warrant.

Specifically, under certain arrangements, the Company makes a commitment to the customer to provide unspecified future software products. As VSOE of fair value cannot be determined for the unspecified future software products, the\nCompany determined that all sales amounts procured under these arrangements be initially deferred and subsequently recognized ratably over the arrangement period. Therefore, previously reported revenues totaling $2.3 million recognized in the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2003 were reclassified to deferred revenue as of June 30, 2003. Furthermore, for the three months ended June 30, 2003, $13,000 of revenue was recognized under these arrangements and is classified as \x93Development Software\nSolutions\x94 as described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

An adjustment was made\nto record these deferred revenue balances at fair value on the date of the acquisition, which led to corresponding adjustments that decreased service revenues by $45,000 during the three months ended June 30, 2002. These adjustments were made to\nconform to accounting rules and interpretations regarding acquisition transactions that require recognition of deferred revenue only to the extent it represents a legal obligation assumed by the acquiring entity.

The Company incurs a\nNational Insurance Contribution (NIC) liability in the United Kingdom, which is a tax on earned income, whenever an employee removes shares from the EBT. The NIC liability equates to a percentage of the fair value of common shares on the date of\nremoval. Due to the uncertain nature of estimating when shares will be removed from the EBT, NIC liabilities will be recorded when incurred. As of June 30, 2003, 936,834 allocated and unexercised shares remained in the EBT and the NIC liability rate\nas of this date was 12.8%.

Most notably, the financial statements for the first three quarters of fiscal 2004 did not properly reflect the appropriate revenue recognition for certain customer arrangements.\nSeveral additional adjustments were also identified. The financial statements included in this quarterly report as of and for the three and six months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 reflect the appropriate characterization for certain customer\narrangements and other noted adjustments. The restatement adjustments have no impact on the net cash flows of the Company.

Our corporate headquarters are located in San Diego, California. This facility houses executive management, as well as sales, marketing, customer\nsupport and administrative departments. We maintain offices in Tokyo, Japan and Poole, Dorset, United Kingdom, whose primary activities surround the sales, marketing and administrative functions for the Pacific Rim and EMEA (Europe, Middle East and\nAfrica) regions, respectively. In addition, our United Kingdom and San Diego offices include engineering personnel responsible for the development effort of our NetVault core and NetVault Application Plug-in Module (APM) software products,\nrespectively.

', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The preparation of our financial statements requires BakBone to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets\nand liabilities. On an on-going basis, BakBone evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and valuation of goodwill. BakBone bases its\nestimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not\nreadily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We believe there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance. These policies affect the\nreported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve management\x92s judgments and estimates. These significant accounting policies are: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'revenue recognition; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'allowance for doubtful accounts; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'valuation allowance for deferred tax assets; and ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'valuation of goodwill. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'These policies, and our procedures related to these policies, are described below. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Revenue recognition ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We recognize software license revenue upon delivery, provided all significant obligations have been met, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,\nfees are fixed and determinable, collections are probable, and we are not involved in significant production, customization, or modification of the software or services that are essential to the functionality of the software. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We license software and provide maintenance services to two distinct groups\nof customers: resellers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). We license software to resellers in arrangements under which they purchase a combination of software, post-contractual support and/or professional services (collectively\n\x93multiple element arrangements\x94). Post-contractual support includes rights to unspecified upgrades and enhancements, and telephone support. Professional services relate to implementation services and training. For these types of\narrangements, we have established vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value for all elements in the multiple element arrangement, and thus, revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the\nelements. VSOE of fair value is established by the price charged when the same element is sold separately. We determine VSOE of fair value of post-contractual support based on substantive renewal rates for the same term post-contractual support.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We also license software under several OEM agreements, which\nare segregated into two categories for revenue recognition purposes. Certain OEM arrangements involve multiple elements where VSOE of fair value exists for all undelivered elements but VSOE of fair value does not exist for one or more delivered\nelements. Under these arrangements revenue is recognized using the residual method, whereby, the fair value of ', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'2 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue, assuming delivery has occurred and collectibility\nis probable. Revenue allocated to post-contractual support is recognized ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. One OEM customer has a specific right of return, whereby the customer is contractually permitted to return our\nproduct during the arrangement period. We use historical returns experience with this customer to estimate potential returns and to establish the appropriate sales returns allowance. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We have also entered into multiple element arrangements with certain OEM customers under which, in addition to providing\nsoftware licenses and maintenance services, we make a commitment to the customer to provide unspecified future software products. As VSOE of fair value cannot be determined for the unspecified future software products, all sales amounts procured\nunder these arrangements are initially deferred and subsequently recognized ratably over the arrangement period. Revenue recognized under these arrangements is included under \x93Development Software Solutions\x94 in Note 6 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We have standard payment terms, which we\noffer to all of our customers, and we do not generally offer any extended payment terms. In addition, our sales agreements do not contain stock balancing rotation rights. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Allowance for doubtful accounts ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make\nrequired payments, which results in a provision for bad debt expense. We determine the adequacy of this allowance by evaluating individual customer accounts receivable, considering the customer\x92s financial condition, credit history and current\neconomic conditions. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate by estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and\nliabilities. Significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. In performing this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets\nwill not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred\ntax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods, we may need to reduce our valuation\nallowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Valuation of goodwill ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We have recorded goodwill in connection with the acquisitions we have completed in prior periods. In accordance with the provisions of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) Handbook Section 3062, ', u'Goodwill and Other\nIntangible Assets ', u'(CICA Section 3062) we review our goodwill for impairment during the first quarter of each fiscal year or when an event or a change in facts and circumstances indicates the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its\ncarrying amount. Events or changes in facts and circumstances that we consider as impairment indicators include the following: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'significant underperformance of our business relative to expected operating results; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'significant adverse economic and industry trends; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'3 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'significant decline in stock price; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'significant decline in revenues; and ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'expectations that a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The annual goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process as follows: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Step 1.', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including the\nexisting goodwill. If the carrying amount of each reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that each reporting unit\x92s goodwill may be impaired and we then perform the second step of the impairment test. If the fair value of\neach reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further analysis is required. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Step 2.', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We compare the implied fair value of each reporting unit\x92s goodwill, determined by allocating each reporting unit\x92s fair value to all of its assets and its liabilities\nin a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of each reporting unit\x92s goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

We generated no development software solutions revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2002. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In November 2002, we decided to \x93end of life\x94 the MagnaVault product line, effective January 1, 2003. During the three months ended September\n30, 2003, we entered into several MagnaVault license arrangements due to customer demand for the product. The three months ended September 30, 2003 included MagnaVault licensing and service revenues of $330,000 and $61,000, respectively. During the\nthree months ended September 30, 2002, MagnaVault licensing revenues were $140,000 and service revenues approximated $138,000. We do not expect to generate a consistent and material revenue stream from this product line in the future.

The Pacific Rim grew licensing\nrevenues primarily through the reseller channel during the three months ended September 30, 2003. During fiscal 2003, the Pacific Rim expanded its business operations into new territories, including China and Korea. The prior year\x92s expansion\ncontributed to the increase in reseller-based licensing revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2003. Our worldwide relationship with NCR produced growth in OEM licensing revenues. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In EMEA, licensing revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2003\nincreased 53% to $1.1 million, from $750,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2002. Similar to North America and the Pacific Rim, EMEA grew licensing revenues through the reseller channel. Increased sales to existing resellers, supplemented\nby sales to new resellers, contributed to licensing revenues growth. Furthermore, licensing revenues increased due to the recent expansion of our operations in EMEA. The growth in OEM licensing revenues was due to the strength of our worldwide\nrelationship with NCR, who accounted for a majority of EMEA\x92s OEM licensing revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Service Revenues ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Service revenues consist principally of maintenance revenues derived from the sale of customer support contracts. These contract fees generally\napproximate 20% of the licensing fee. Revenues from customer support contracts are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, which is generally one year. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In North America, service revenues for the three months ended September 30,\n2003 increased 75% to $659,000, from $377,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2002. In the Pacific Rim, service revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2003 grew 123% to $295,000, from $132,000, for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2002. In EMEA, service revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2003 increased 85% to $263,000, from $142,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2002. The worldwide growth in service revenues is directly related to\nincreased licensing revenues from sales to new customers and to maintenance contract renewals from existing customers. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Development Software Solutions Revenues ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We have also entered into multiple element arrangements with certain OEM customers under which, in addition to providing software licenses and maintenance\nservices, we make a commitment to the customer to provide unspecified future software products. As VSOE of fair value cannot be determined for the unspecified future software products, all sales amounts procured under these arrangements are\ninitially deferred and subsequently recognized ratably over the arrangement period. Revenue recognized under these arrangements is included under \x93Development Software Solutions\x94 in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. We\nrecognized $169,000 in Development Software Solutions revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2003. We did not recognize any such revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2002. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Cost of Revenues ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Cost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2003 totaled\n$683,000 with a gross margin of 89%, compared with cost of revenues of $390,000 with a gross margin of 90% for the three months ended September 30, 2002. These costs consisted of the direct cost of providing customer support, including salary and\n', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'5 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'benefits of staff working in our customer support departments, as well as associated costs of computer equipment, telephone and other general costs necessary\nto maintain support for our end users. Also included in cost of revenues are third party software license royalties and the direct costs of raw materials and packaging for products shipped to customers. Although we are required to defer the total\narrangement value and recognize the related revenue over the arrangement period, third-party software license royalties are due upon our procurement of development software solutions sales. The direct costs of raw materials and packaging are nominal\nas products shipped to customers consist of a CD, manual, printed box and other media. Product costs for these items individually and in aggregate are minimal and we have little risk of inventory obsolescence due to the small quantities of these\nitems needed to fill our customers\x92 orders and the short lead time to acquire additional materials. Raw material purchases are held in inventory until the sale of the related software product at which time the cost per unit sold is released to\ncost of revenues. The increase in cost of revenues as a percent of total revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2003 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2002 was due primarily to additional customer support headcount and to\ntiming differences between the recognition of development software solutions revenues and related third-party royalties. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The increase in cost of revenues in absolute dollars was due primarily to the overall increase in sales volume. Gross margin decreased to 89% from 90%\nbetween the three months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002. Third-party software license royalties accounted for the decreased gross margin. Increased customer support and raw materials costs were offset by a proportionate increase in total\nrevenues. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Sales and Marketing Expenses\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of\npayroll, commission, marketing, and travel costs for our worldwide sales staff.

The increase was attributed primarily to increases in headcount and performance-based payments, which consisted principally of commissions and bonuses. We added headcount primarily in the Pacific Rim and EMEA, as we expanded our\noperations in those regions. The increase in performance-based payments was a direct function of revenue growth during the three months ended September 30, 2003.

Research and development expenses\ndecreased $264,000, or 20%, to $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2003, from $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2002. The overall decrease was due primarily to a reduction in headcount surrounding the November\n2002 decision to \x93end of life\x94 the MagnaVault product line. We have made recent research and development hires; however, research and development headcount as of September 30, 2002 still exceeded that as of September 30, 2003.

The decrease in general and administrative expenses relates mainly to the decrease in professional services costs.\nMost notably, we incurred significant, non-recurring legal and accounting costs in conjunction with the rearrangement of our corporate structure in which we reduced the number of subsidiaries from seven to four during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2002. Cost reductions were also realized during the three months ended September 30, 2003 from the termination of a consulting agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.

Most recently, during the second quarter of fiscal 2004, we raised proceeds of approximately $14.3 million, net of\napproximately $1.4 million in offering costs paid during the second quarter of fiscal 2004, through the issuance of 22,000,000 Series A Convertible Preferred Shares (Preferred Shares) at CDN$1.00 per share. An additional $594,000 of offering costs,\nbringing the total offering costs paid and accrued to approximately $2.0 million, were accrued as of September 30, 2003 and will be paid during the third quarter of fiscal 2004.

Net cash provided by and used in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002 was $157,000 and $2.1 million, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities during the three months\nended September 30, 2003 resulted from a net loss of $58,000, which was offset by non-cash depreciation and amortization of $232,000. Operating activities that provided cash were a decrease in accounts receivable of $12,000 and an increase in\ndeferred revenue of $635,000. Operating activities that contributed to the use of cash during the three months ended September 30, 2003 included increases in other assets of $82,000 and decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of\n$212,000 and $370,000, respectively. Cash used in operating activities during the three months ended September 30, 2002 included a net loss of $2.4 million which was partially offset by non-cash stock-based compensation of $85,000 and depreciation\nand amortization of $241,000. Operating activities that provided cash were a decrease in other assets of $73,000 and increases in accrued liabilities and deferred revenue of $101,000 and $326,000, respectively. Operating activities that contributed\nto the use of cash during the three months ended September 30, 2002 included an increase in accounts receivable of $426,000 and a decrease in accounts payable of $25,000. During the three months ended September 30, 2003 we generated positive\noperating cash flow, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2002 where we experienced an operating cash flow loss. The overall increase in cash provided by operations was due primarily to a significant increase in revenue combined with a\nconsistent level of operating expenses.

', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We currently expect to fund expenditures for capital requirements, as well as liquidity needs from a combination of available cash balances, internally generated funds and financing arrangements. We believe that cash\nand cash equivalents existing as of September 30, 2003 will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs through the next twelve months. However, internally generated funds, when combined with proceeds received from the issuance of Preferred\nShares, may not be sufficient to cover our liquidity requirements in future fiscal years, and in that case, we may be required to obtain additional credit facilities. Additional debt would result in increased interest expense and could result in\ncovenants that would restrict our operations. Additionally, a decrease in demand for our products and services could adversely affect our business, which in turn, could adversely affect our ability to obtain access to new credit facilities in the\nfuture and could increase the cost of such facilities. We may also seek additional sources of funding, including the public or private issuance of equity instruments; however, there is no guarantee that such sources will be available in amounts or\non terms acceptable to us, if available at all. The sale of additional equity securities would result in immediate and potentially significant dilution to our shareholders. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Estimated future uses of cash in fiscal 2004 include capital expenditures for equipment of approximately $200,000.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'At September 30, 2003, we did not have any relationships with\nunconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance, special purpose, or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet\narrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we did not engage in trading activities involving on-exchange traded contracts. As a result, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that\ncould arise if we had engaged in such relationships. We do not have relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationship with us or our related parties except as disclosed herein.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'13 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Risk Factors ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'You should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this report in evaluating our business and our prospects. The risks\nand uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually\noccur, our business and financial results could be harmed. In that case the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this report, including our financial statements and the\naccompanying notes. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Competition in our target markets\ncould reduce our sales on several fronts. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We have a\nnumber of competitors in our target markets. If existing or new competitors gain market share, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do in the areas of sales,\nmarketing and product development and we expect to face additional competition from these competitors in the future. Our existing and future competitors could introduce products with superior features, scalability and functionality at lower prices\nthan our products. Our competitors could gain market share by bundling existing or new products with other more established products or by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our other competitors. If our competitors are successful in\ngaining market share, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our revenues will decline significantly if the market does not continue to accept our NetVault product. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We derive substantially all of our licensing revenues from our NetVault\nproduct. We currently expect to continue to derive substantially all of our revenues from this product. If the market does not continue to accept this product, our revenues will decline significantly, and this would negatively affect our operating\nresults. Factors that may affect the market acceptance of our NetVault product include the performance, price and total cost of ownership of our product and the availability, functionality and price of competing products and technologies. Many of\nthese factors are beyond our control. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We derive a\nsignificant amount of revenues from only a few customers. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We have derived, and believe we will continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers. Most notably, one customer accounted for approximately 12% and 14%, respectively, of consolidated revenues\nduring the three and six months ended September 30, 2003. Many of our key customers have recently announced that their own businesses are slowing, which could adversely affect their demand for our products. If any of our largest customers were to\nreduce purchases from us, our business would be adversely affected. In addition, we do not have contracts with our key customers that require such customers to purchase a specified number of software licenses from us. Therefore, we cannot be sure\nthat these customers will continue to purchase our products at current levels. As a result, a significant reseller in one period may decide not to purchase our product in a subsequent period, which would have an adverse impact on our revenues.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Failure to manage our growth could adversely affect our\nbusiness. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'If we fail to manage our growth effectively,\nour business and operating results could be adversely affected, which could cause the market price of our stock to fall. We expect to continue to grow our operations domestically and internationally, and to hire additional employees. The growth in\nour operations and staff has placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain on our management systems and resources. If we fail to manage our future anticipated growth, we may experience higher operating expenses, and we may be unable to\nmeet the expectations of securities analysts or investors with respect to future operating results. To manage this growth we must continue to: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'improve our financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'add and integrate new employees; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'14 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'control expenses; and ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'integrate geographically dispersed operations. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We have committed a significant amount of funds to obtaining additional systems and facilities to accommodate our current and future anticipated growth.\nTo the extent this anticipated growth does not occur or occurs more slowly than we anticipate, we may not be able to reduce expenses to the same degree. Any failure to manage our growth effectively could seriously harm our business and operating\nresults. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Inability to protect our technologies could\naffect our ability to compete. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We may receive claims\nthat we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. As the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products continue to overlap, we become increasingly susceptible to infringement claims,\nincluding patent, trademark and copyright infringement claims. In addition, past employers of former, current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of\nthese past employers. Any such claim, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management\x92s attention from our core business, require us to stop selling or delay shipping our product, or\ncause the redesign of our product. In addition, we may be required to pay monetary amounts as damages, for royalty or licensing arrangements, or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We license and use software from third parties in our business. These third\nparty software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms. Also, these third parties may from time to time receive claims that they have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, including patent and copyright\ninfringement claims, which may affect our ability to continue licensing this software. Our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business, which could materially and adversely\naffect our operating results. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Inability to protect our\nproprietary information will adversely affect our business. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other measures to protect our proprietary information. All of these measures afford only limited protection.\nThese measures may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged, and others may develop technologies or processes that are similar or superior to our technology. We license some of our products under \x93shrink wrap\x94 license agreements that do\nnot require a physical signature by the end user licensee and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy our products or to\nobtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our products have a short product life cycle. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Software products typically have a limited life cycle and it is difficult to estimate when they will become obsolete. We must therefore continually develop and introduce innovative new products and/or upgraded versions of our existing\nproducts before the current software has completed its life cycle. If we are unable to keep pace with the need to supply new products or to enhance existing products, we may not be able to achieve and sustain the level of sales required for success.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our foreign operations and sales create unique\nchallenges that could adversely affect our operating results. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'An investment in our securities involves greater risk than an investment in many other businesses because we have significant operations outside of the United States, including engineering, sales and client services, and it is our intention\nto expand these international operations. As of September 30, 2003, we had 49 employees in EMEA and 37 employees in the Pacific Rim. Our foreign operations are subject to a number of risks, including: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy, misappropriation or weaker laws regarding intellectual property protection; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'15 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'the impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS); ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'imposition of foreign laws and other governmental controls, including trade restrictions; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'unexpected domestic and international political or regulatory changes; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic instability such as higher interest rates and inflation, which could reduce our customers\x92 ability to obtain financing for\nsoftware products or which could make our product more expensive in those countries; and ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'difficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In addition, our foreign sales are substantially denominated in their\nrespective local currency, creating risk of foreign currency translation gains and losses that could adversely affect our business and operating results. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We rely on competing equipment manufacturers as a material source of revenues. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'A portion of our revenues comes from OEMs that incorporate our storage management software into their hardware solution.\nRisks associated with OEM relationships include: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'we have no control over the shipping dates or volumes of systems they ship; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'they have no obligation to recommend or offer our software products; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'they may generally have no minimum sales requirements and can terminate our relationship at any time or upon short notice; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'they could choose to develop their own data availability products and incorporate those products into their systems instead of our products; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'they could develop enhancements to and derivative products from our products; and ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'they could change their own base products, which could make it difficult for us to adapt our products to theirs. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Finally, our OEM customers compete with one another. If one of our OEM\ncustomers views the products we have developed for another OEM as competing with its products, it might decide to stop doing business with us, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our success depends on our ability to develop new and enhanced products\nthat achieve widespread market acceptance. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our future\nsuccess depends on our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of customers by developing and introducing new products, product updates and services on a timely basis, by extending the operation of our products on new platforms, and by keeping\npace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. In order to grow our business, we are committing substantial resources to develop software products and services for the SAN (Storage Area Network) market and the NAS (Network\nAttached Storage) market. Each of these markets is new and industry standards for these markets are evolving and changing. If these markets do not develop as anticipated, or demand for our products in these markets fails to materialize or occurs\nmore slowly than we expect, we will have expended substantial resources and capital without realizing sufficient revenue, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'16 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Our quarterly revenues may fluctuate significantly, which could cause the market price of our stock\nto be extremely volatile. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We may experience a\nshortfall in revenues in any given quarter in relation to our plans or investor expectations. Any such shortfall in revenues could cause the market price of our stock to fall substantially. Our revenues in general, and our licensing revenues in\nparticular, are difficult to forecast and are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'the timing and magnitude of sales through our OEM customers; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'the introduction, timing and market acceptance of new products; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'the rate of adoption of NAS and SAN technologies and the timing and magnitude of sales of our products and services for these markets; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'the extent to which our customers renew maintenance contracts with us; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'changes in our pricing policies and distribution terms; and ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'the possibility that our customers may defer purchases in anticipation of new products or product updates by us or by our competitors. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'You should not rely on the results of any prior periods as an indication of\nour future performance. If we have a shortfall in revenues in any given quarter, our efforts to reduce our operating expenses in response will likely lag behind the revenues shortfall. Therefore, any significant shortfall in revenues will likely\nhave an immediate adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Existing strategic alliances may be terminated and we may be unable to develop new relationships. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our growth and marketing strategies are based, in part, on seeking out and forming strategic alliances with third-party suppliers, VARs, VADs, OEMs and\nother businesses integral to our future success. None of our channel partners or OEMs has any obligation to continue selling our products and any of them may terminate their relationship with us at any time. We cannot assure you that existing\nstrategic alliances will not be terminated or modified in the future nor can we assure you that we will be able to develop new relationships. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'A portion of our revenues comes from OEM sales that incorporate our storage management software into the OEM hardware solution. We have no control over\nthe shipping dates or volumes of systems the OEMs ship and they have no obligation to ship systems incorporating our software. They also have no obligation to recommend or offer our software products exclusively or at all. These OEMs also could\nchoose to bundle competitors\x92 products in lieu of our product. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We expect a large portion of our revenues will come from our channel partners across the world. These partners have no obligation to establish a sales relationship or to continue selling any of our products and can terminate the\nrelationship with us at any time upon written notice as described in the related channel partner agreements. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our products may contain significant defects, which may result in liability and/or decreased sales. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Software products frequently contain errors or failures, especially when\nfirst introduced or when new versions are released. Despite our best efforts to test our products, we might experience significant errors or failures in our products, or they might not work with other hardware or software as expected, which could\ndelay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and adversely affect market acceptance of our products. End-user customers use our products for applications that are critical to their businesses, and they have a greater\nsensitivity to product defects than the market for other software products generally. Our customers may claim that we are responsible for damages to the extent they are harmed by the failure of any of ', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'17 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'our products. If we were to experience significant delays in the release of new products or new versions of products, or if customers were dissatisfied with\nproduct functionality or performance, we could lose revenue or be subject to liability for service or warranty costs, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We may require additional capital and raising such capital will dilute our shareholders\x92 ownership interest in\nus. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We may need to raise additional funds from lenders\nand/or equity markets. During the second quarter of fiscal 2004, we raised proceeds of approximately $14.3 million, net of approximately $1.4 million in offering costs, through the issuance of 22,000,000 Series A Convertible Preferred Shares at\nCDN$1.00 per share. However, internally generated funds, when combined with the aforementioned proceeds, may not be sufficient to cover our liquidity requirements, and in that case, we may require additional capital. In the case that we do require\nadditional capital, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms satisfactory to us or at all. If we raise additional capital or arrange for debt financing through mechanisms, which involve\nadditional issuance of our stock, control of the Company may change and shareholders will experience dilution to their equity interests in the Company. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Evolving regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses and continuing uncertainty. ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance\nand public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and new SEC regulations are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours. These new or changed securities laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in\nmany cases due to their lack of specificity. As a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters\nand higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, we intend to invest resources to comply with\nevolving securities laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our\nefforts to comply with new or changed securities laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, our reputation may be harmed.

If we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees, our business and operating results may be adversely affected. We need to hire and retain sales,\ntechnical, and management personnel to support the planned expansion of our business and to meet the anticipated increased customer demand for our products and services. Competition for people with the skills we require is intense, particularly in\nthe San Diego area where our headquarters is located, and the high cost of living in this area makes our recruiting and compensation costs higher. As a result, we expect to continue to experience increases in compensation costs. We cannot assure you\nthat we will be successful in hiring or retaining new personnel.

Specifically, under certain OEM arrangements, the Company makes a commitment to the customer to provide unspecified future software products. As VSOE of fair value cannot be determined for the unspecified future software products, the\nCompany determined that all sales amounts procured under these arrangements be initially deferred and subsequently recognized ratably over the arrangement period. Therefore, previously reported revenues totaling $190,000 and $2.4 million,\nrespectively, recognized in the three and six months ended September 30, 2003 were reclassified to deferred revenue. Furthermore, for the three and six months ended September 30, 2003, $169,000 and $182,000, respectively, of revenue was recognized\nunder these arrangements and is classified as \x93Development Software Solutions\x94 as described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

These adjustments were made to conform to accounting rules and interpretations regarding acquisition transactions that require\nrecognition of deferred revenue only to the extent it represents a legal obligation assumed by the acquiring entity.

The restatement\nadjustment included in the three and six months ended September 30, 2002 represents the incurrence of $111,000 and $222,000, respectively, in additional rent expense. This expense was recorded originally as of March 31, 2002 in connection with an\nunused facility liability; however, the criteria for liability and expense recognition were not met as of March 31, 2002. Thus, the $222,000 rent expense was reversed during the three months ended March 31, 2002 and recorded during the six months\nended September 31, 2003.

The original purchase price of the Company\x92s 53% step acquisition of BakBone KK allocated no value to separately identified intangible assets. The Company has since determined that\n$222,000 in amortizable intangible assets should have been recorded, with the intangible assets being amortized over the assets\x92 useful life of four years. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Weighted-average common shares outstanding ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The Company determined that the number of weighted-average shares outstanding, which is used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share, required\nadjusting for the three and six months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002. Historically, the Company considered certain shares to be contingently issuable for purposes of calculating the number of weighted-average shares outstanding In accordance\nwith the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants Handbook (CICA) Section 3500, ', u'Earnings Per Share', u', contingently issuable shares are included in the calculation of the number of weighted-average shares only after the contingent event has\nbeen satisfied. Upon further review, the Company determined that these shares were improperly classified as contingently issuable, thus, the number of weighted-averaged shares outstanding was adjusted accordingly. As a result, the number of\nweighted-average common shares was increased by 247,759 and 1,001,347 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2003, respectively, and increased by 1,940,372 and 2,632,653 for the three and six months ended September 30, 2002, respectively.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'24 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'BAKBONE SOFTWARE INCORPORATED ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\x97(Continued) ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Impacts of the restatement on the accompanying consolidated financial statements ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The following provides a summary of the impact of the restatements for the\nperiods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Consolidated statement of operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2003 as restated ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'For the three months ended September 30, 2003, net income of $132,000 was adjusted to a net loss of $58,000.

The Company incurs a\nNational Insurance Contribution (NIC) liability in the United Kingdom, which is a tax on earned income, whenever an employee removes shares from the EBT. The NIC liability equates to a percentage of the fair value of common shares on the date of\nremoval. Due to the uncertain nature of estimating when shares will be removed from the EBT, NIC liabilities will be recorded when incurred. As of September 30, 2003, 936,834 allocated and unexercised shares remained in the EBT and the NIC liability\npercentage as of this date was 12.8%.

Most notably, the financial statements for the first three quarters of fiscal 2004 did not properly reflect the appropriate revenue recognition for certain customer arrangements.\nSeveral additional adjustments were also identified. The financial statements included in this quarterly report as of and for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 reflect the appropriate characterization for certain customer\narrangements and other noted adjustments. The restatement adjustments have no impact on the net cash flows of the Company.

A complete discussion of the restated financial data is included in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Overview ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'BakBone Software Incorporated (the Company or BakBone) is a leading international data protection solution provider that develops and distributes data\nbackup, restore, and disaster recovery software for network storage and open systems environments worldwide. BakBone delivers scalable solutions that address the complex demands of large enterprise environments, as well as small-to-medium-sized\nbusinesses. Our products are distributed primarily through a select global network of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) partners, Value Added Resellers (VARs), Value Added Distributors (VADs), and other solution providers. Since its inception in\nMarch 2000, the Company has generally experienced period-over-period revenue growth in its overall business worldwide. We currently operate in three primary regions \x96 North America, the Pacific Rim, and Europe, Middle East, Africa (EMEA). Our\ncorporate headquarters are located in San Diego, California, a facility that houses executive management, as well as sales, marketing, research and development, customer support and administrative departments. Our Tokyo, Japan office serves as the\nregional hub for our Pacific Rim operations ', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'1 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'and supports the sales, marketing and administration functions of that region. We also maintain an office in Poole, Dorset, United Kingdom, that houses\nsales, marketing, research and development and administrative departments. BakBone also operates several smaller satellite offices throughout these regions that focus primarily on the sales function. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'For the nine months ended December 31, 2003, our North American, Pacific Rim\nand EMEA operations contributed 40%, 37% and 23% of our revenues, respectively, compared to 41%, 39% and 20% of our revenues, respectively, for the nine months ended December 31, 2002. During the third quarter of fiscal 2004, we continued to\nexperience a positive growth trend across the three regions in which we operate. From a global perspective, we have focused on increasing our reseller base and growing our current OEM relationships with NCR Teradata (NCR), Sony Electronics (Sony)\nand Network Appliance (NetApp). During the third quarter, our NCR and Sony relationships continued to generate revenues and we anticipate that these relationships will continue to produce revenue streams for the foreseeable future. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We license software and provide maintenance services to two distinct groups\nof customers: resellers and OEMs. We license software to resellers in arrangements under which they purchase a combination of software, post-contractual support (PCS) and/or professional services (collectively \x93multiple element\narrangements\x94). We generally offer non-exclusive, perpetual software licenses to our customers, and do not offer time-based software licenses. PCS contracts generally cover a period of one year, and after contract expiration, our customers have\nthe right to purchase PCS contract renewals, which generally cover a period of one year. PCS includes rights to unspecified upgrades and enhancements, and telephone support. Professional services relate to implementation services and training. We\nhave established vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value for all elements in the multiple element arrangement, and thus, revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements. VSOE of fair\nvalue is established by the price charged when the same element is sold separately. We determine VSOE of fair value of post-contractual support based on substantive renewal rates for the same term post-contractual support. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We also license software under several OEM agreements, which are segregated\ninto two categories for revenue recognition purposes. Certain OEM arrangements involve multiple elements where VSOE of fair value exists for all undelivered elements but VSOE of fair value does not exist for one or more delivered elements. Under\nthese arrangements revenue is recognized using the residual method, whereby, the fair value of undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue, assuming delivery has occurred and\ncollectibility is probable. Revenue allocated to post-contractual support is recognized ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. One OEM customer has a specific right of return, whereby the customer is contractually permitted\nto return our product during the arrangement period. We use historical returns experience with this customer to estimate potential returns and to establish the appropriate sales returns allowance. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We have also entered into multiple element arrangements with certain OEM\ncustomers under which, in addition to providing software licenses and maintenance services, we make a commitment to the customer to provide unspecified future software products. As VSOE of fair value cannot be determined for the unspecified future\nsoftware products, all sales amounts procured under these arrangements are initially deferred and subsequently recognized ratably over the arrangement period. Revenue recognized under these arrangements is included under \x93Development Software\nSolutions\x94 in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our license and PCS sales are generated from customer purchase orders, whereby our customers enter into an arrangement with us to provide specified software licenses and/or PCS. The majority of our arrangements with customers involve the\nsale of off-the-shelf software without significant production, customization, or modification of software or services essential to the functionality of the software. Service revenues consist principally of maintenance revenues derived from the sale\nof PCS contracts. These contract fees generally approximate 20% of the licensing fee. Revenues from PCS contracts are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, which is generally one year. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'2 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Cost of revenues consist of the direct cost of providing customer support, including salary and benefits\nof staff working in our customer support departments, as well as associated costs of computer equipment, telephone and other general costs necessary to maintain support for our end users. Also included in cost of revenues are third party software\nlicense royalties and the direct costs of raw materials and packaging for products shipped to customers. The direct costs of raw materials and packaging are nominal as products shipped to customers consist of a CD, manual, printed box and other\nmedia. Product costs for these items individually and in aggregate are minimal and we have little risk of inventory obsolescence due to the small quantities of these items needed to fill our customers\x92 orders and the short lead time to acquire\nadditional materials. Raw material purchases are held in inventory until the sale of the related software product, at which time the cost per unit sold is released to cost of revenues. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll, commission, marketing, and travel costs for our worldwide sales\nstaff. Commissions are part of our sales personnel\x92s compensation package, which are based on the procurement of sales orders and subsequent collection of customer receivables. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and related costs for our worldwide engineering staff. Our\nUnited Kingdom and San Diego offices include engineering personnel responsible for the development effort of our NetVault core and NetVault Application Plug-in Module (APM) software products, respectively. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'General and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits for our\ncorporate personnel and other expenses, such as facilities, insurance costs and professional services costs. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Critical Accounting Policies ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Canada, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, except as discussed in Note 17\nto the audited consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Information Form for the year ended March 31, 2003, as amended by our Annual Information Form for the year ended March 31, 2004. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The preparation of our financial statements requires BakBone to make\nestimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, BakBone evaluates its estimates, including those related to\nrevenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and valuation of goodwill. BakBone bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable\nunder the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different\nassumptions or conditions. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We believe there are several\naccounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance. These policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve management\x92s judgments and estimates. These significant\naccounting policies are: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'revenue recognition; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'allowance for doubtful accounts; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'valuation allowance for deferred tax assets; and ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'valuation of goodwill. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'These policies, and our procedures related to these policies, are described below. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'3 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Revenue recognition ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We recognize software license revenue upon delivery, provided all significant obligations have been met, persuasive evidence\nof an arrangement exists, fees are fixed and determinable, collections are probable, and we are not involved in significant production, customization, or modification of the software or services that are essential to the functionality of the\nsoftware. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We license software and provide maintenance services\nto two distinct groups of customers: resellers and OEMs. We license software to resellers in arrangements under which they purchase a combination of software, post-contractual support and/or professional services (collectively \x93multiple element\narrangements\x94). Post-contractual support includes rights to unspecified upgrades and enhancements, and telephone support. Professional services relate to implementation services and training. For these types of arrangements, we have established\nvendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value for all elements in the multiple element arrangement, and thus, revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements. VSOE of fair value is\nestablished by the price charged when the same element is sold separately. We determine VSOE of fair value of post-contractual support based on substantive renewal rates for the same term post-contractual support. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We also license software under several OEM agreements, which are segregated\ninto two categories for revenue recognition purposes. Certain OEM arrangements involve multiple elements where VSOE of fair value exists for all undelivered elements but VSOE of fair value does not exist for one or more delivered elements.

One OEM customer has a specific right of return, whereby the customer is contractually permitted\nto return our product within a specified time period. We use historical returns experience with this customer to estimate potential returns and to establish the appropriate sales returns allowance. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We have also entered into multiple element arrangements with certain OEM\ncustomers under which, in addition to providing software licenses and maintenance services, we make a commitment to the customer to provide unspecified future software products. As VSOE of fair value cannot be determined for the unspecified future\nsoftware products, all sales amounts procured under these arrangements are initially deferred and subsequently recognized ratably over the arrangement period. Revenues recognized under these arrangements are included under \x93Development Software\nSolutions\x94 in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We have standard payment terms, which we offer to all of our customers, and we do not generally offer any extended payment terms. In addition, our sales agreements do not contain stock balancing rotation rights. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Allowance for doubtful accounts ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting\nfrom the inability of our customers to make required payments, which results in a provision for bad debt expense. We determine the adequacy of this allowance by evaluating individual customer accounts receivable, considering the customer\x92s\nfinancial condition and credit history and the current economic conditions. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income\ntax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement purposes. These\ndifferences ', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'4 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. In\nperforming this assessment, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable\nincome during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. In the event\nthat actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods, we may need to reduce our valuation allowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Valuation of goodwill ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We have recorded goodwill in connection with the acquisitions we have\ncompleted in prior periods. In accordance with the provisions of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) Handbook Section 3062, ', u'Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets', u' (CICA Section 3062) we review our goodwill for impairment\nduring the first quarter of each fiscal year or when an event or a change in facts and circumstances indicates the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying amount. Events or changes in facts and circumstances that we consider as\nimpairment indicators include the following: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'significant underperformance of our business relative to expected operating results; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'significant adverse economic and industry trends; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'significant decline in stock price; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'significant decline in revenues; and ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'expectations that a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The annual goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process as follows: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Step 1.', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including the\nexisting goodwill. If the carrying amount of each reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that each reporting unit\x92s goodwill may be impaired and we then perform the second step of the impairment test. If the fair value of\neach reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further analysis is required. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Step 2.', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We compare the implied fair value of each reporting unit\x92s goodwill, determined by allocating each reporting unit\x92s fair value to all of its assets and its liabilities\nin a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of each reporting unit\x92s goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Results of Operations ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Investors should rely solely on the financial statements in this quarterly report and not on previously published\nquarterly results. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Three Months Ended December 31, 2003\n(restated) Compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2002 (restated).

Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2003 consisted of $5.6 million in\nlicensing revenues, $1.4 million in service revenues, and $193,000 in development ', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'5 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'software solutions revenues, compared to revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2002, which consisted of $4.2 million in licensing revenues and\n$663,000 in service revenues. We generated no development software solutions revenues during the three months ended December 31, 2002. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In November 2002, we undertook a plan to \x93end of life\x94 the MagnaVault product line, effective January 1, 2003. During the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2003, we entered into several MagnaVault license arrangements due to customer demand for the product. The three months ended December 31, 2003 included MagnaVault licensing and service revenues of $219,000 and $46,000, respectively.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2002, MagnaVault licensing revenues were $496,000 and service revenues approximated $101,000. We do not expect to generate a consistent and material revenue stream from this product line in the foreseeable\nfuture. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Licensing Revenues ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our products are sold almost exclusively through our channel partners, VARs,\nVADs and OEMs, in three geographic segments: North America, the Pacific Rim and EMEA. During the three months ended December 31, 2003, licensing revenues growth was led by both our reseller and OEM channels. Substantially all of our OEM licensing\nrevenues had been derived through our worldwide relationship with NCR during the three months ended December 31, 2003. During the third quarter, we continued to expand our reseller base through organic growth in all regions and through geographic\nexpansion within the Pacific Rim and EMEA. We also continued to generate significant OEM licensing revenues through our relationship with NCR. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In North America, licensing revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2003 increased 14% to $2.0\xa0million, from $1.7 million for the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2002. Licensing revenues growth in North America was driven by both the reseller and OEM channels. The establishment of new reseller relationships and the leveraging of existing reseller relationships led the growth in\nlicensing revenues during the three months ended December 31, 2003. We also continued to generate OEM licensing revenues through our OEM relationship with NCR. We anticipate that this relationship will continue to produce a licensing revenue stream\nfor the foreseeable future. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In the Pacific Rim, licensing\nrevenues for the three months ended December 31, 2003 increased 41% to $2.3\xa0million, from $1.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2002. The Pacific Rim grew licensing revenues through our reseller and OEM relationships. During\nfiscal 2003 and 2004, the Pacific Rim expanded its business operations into new territories, including China and South Korea. The prior year\x92s expansion, combined with business growth in existing territories, contributed to the increase in\nreseller-based licensing revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2003. Our worldwide relationship with NCR produced the growth in OEM licensing revenues. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In EMEA, licensing revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2003 increased 67% to $1.3 million, from $805,000 for\nthe three months ended December 31, 2002. EMEA licensing revenues grew through both the reseller and OEM channels. Increased sales to existing resellers, supplemented by sales to new resellers, contributed to licensing revenues growth. During fiscal\n2003 and 2004, EMEA expanded its business operations, most notably in Germany and France. This expansion contributed to the licensing revenues growth during the three months ended December 31, 2003. The growth in OEM licensing revenues was due\nprimarily to the strength of our worldwide relationship with NCR, which accounted for a majority of EMEA\x92s OEM licensing revenues during the three months ended December 31, 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Service Revenues ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In North America, service revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2003 increased 71% to $679,000, from $398,000 for the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2002. In the Pacific Rim, service revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2003 grew 178% to $389,000, from $140,000, for the three months ', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'6 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'ended December 31, 2002. In EMEA, service revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2003 increased 197% to $371,000, from $125,000 for the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2002. The worldwide growth in service revenues is directly related to increased licensing revenues from sales to new customers and to PCS contract renewals from existing customers. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Development Software Solutions Revenues ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We have also entered into multiple element arrangements with certain OEM\ncustomers under which, in addition to providing software licenses and maintenance services, we make a commitment to the customer to provide unspecified future software products. As VSOE of fair value cannot be determined for the unspecified future\nsoftware products, all sales amounts procured under these arrangements are initially deferred and subsequently recognized ratably over the arrangement period. Revenues recognized under these arrangements are included under \x93Development Software\nSolutions\x94 in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. We recognized $193,000 in Development Software Solutions revenues during the three months ended December 31, 2003. We did not recognize any such revenues during the three months\nended December 31, 2002. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Cost of Revenues\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Cost of revenues for the three months ended December\n31, 2003 totaled $759,000 with a gross margin of 90%, compared with cost of revenues of $405,000 with a gross margin of 92% for the three months ended December 31, 2002. The increase in cost of revenues in absolute dollars was due primarily to the\ncorresponding increase in sales volume. The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to increases in customer support headcount and timing differences between the recognition of development software solutions revenues and related third-party\nroyalties. Although we are required to defer the total arrangement value and recognize the related revenue over the arrangement period, third-party software license royalties are due upon our procurement of development software solutions sales.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Sales and Marketing Expenses ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Sales and marketing expenses increased $874,000, or 29%, to $3.9 million for\nthe three months ended December 31, 2003, from $3.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2002. The increase was attributed primarily to increases in headcount, performance-based payments, which consisted principally of commissions and\nbonuses, and advertising and trade show related activities. We added headcount, primarily in the Pacific Rim and EMEA, as we expanded our operations in those regions. The increase in performance-based payments was a direct function of revenue growth\nduring the three months ended December 31, 2003. Additionally, we participated in numerous trade shows and increased our advertising activity during the three months ended December 31, 2003. We expect to increase sales headcount during the fourth\nquarter of fiscal 2004 and into fiscal 2005. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Sales and\nmarketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2003 decreased to 54%, from 63% for the three months ended December 31, 2002. The decrease was due primarily to the increase in total revenues. ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Research and Development Expenses ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Research and development expenses remained relatively stable at $1.2 million\nfor the three months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. There was a reduction in headcount surrounding the November 2002 decision to \x93end of life\x94 the MagnaVault product line. We have made recent research and development hires and research\nand development headcount as of December 31, 2003 exceeded that as of December 31, 2002. However, research and development headcount as of December 31, 2003 remained lower than research and development headcount immediately prior to the headcount\nreduction that occurred in November 2002.

The decrease in general and administrative expenses relates mainly to a decrease in professional services costs. Most notably,\nwe incurred significant, non-recurring legal costs during the three months ended December 31, 2002 in conjunction with two legal projects: the rearrangement of our corporate structure and the external review of our intellectual property portfolio.\nFurthermore, we realized cost reductions during the three months ended December 31, 2003 from the termination of a consulting agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. These cost reductions were offset partially by an increase in salary\nrelated expenses, which was due primarily to annual salary increases and the hiring of additional management-level personnel.

We incurred no such charge during the three months ended December 31, 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Provision for income taxes ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'During the three months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, we recorded provisions for income taxes of $235,000 and $79,000, respectively. During the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, certain transactions between our foreign subsidiaries triggered tax liabilities in the respective jurisdictions in which we do business.

Revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2003 consisted of $15.1 million in licensing revenues, $3.7 million in service revenues, and $375,000 in development\nsoftware solutions revenues, compared to revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2002, which consisted of $10.6 million in licensing revenues and $1.8 million in service revenues. We generated no development software solutions revenues\nduring the nine months ended December 31, 2002. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'8 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'In November 2002, we undertook a plan to \x93end of life\x94 the MagnaVault product line, effective\nJanuary 1, 2003. During the nine months ended December 31, 2003, we entered into several MagnaVault license arrangements due to customer demand for the product. The nine months ended December 31, 2003 included MagnaVault licensing and service\nrevenues of $568,000 and $200,000, respectively. During the nine months ended December 31, 2002, MagnaVault licensing and service revenues were $800,000 and $377,000, respectively. We do not expect to generate a consistent and material revenue\nstream from this product line in the foreseeable future. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Licensing Revenues ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'During the nine\nmonths ended December 31, 2003, licensing revenues growth worldwide was driven by both the OEM and reseller sales channels. Substantially all of our OEM licensing revenues during the nine months ended December 31, 2003 were derived through our\nworldwide relationship with NCR. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our relationships with\nexisting resellers and the establishment of new reseller relationships led to significant licensing revenues growth through our reseller channel. Furthermore, we continued the expansion of our business into new regions, primarily within the Pacific\nRim and EMEA, which led to licensing revenues growth. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In North\nAmerica, licensing revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2003 increased 32% to $5.3\xa0million, from $4.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2002. Licensing revenues growth in North America was driven by both the reseller and\nOEM channels. We continued to establish new reseller relationships, while leveraging existing relationships, to grow revenues through the reseller channel. We also continued to generate OEM licensing revenues through our OEM relationship with NCR.\nWe anticipate that this relationship will continue to produce a licensing revenue stream for the foreseeable future. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In the Pacific Rim, licensing revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2003 increased 38% to $6.1\xa0million, from $4.4 million for the nine\nmonths ended December 31, 2002. The Pacific Rim grew licensing revenues through the reseller channel. During fiscal 2003 and 2004, the Pacific Rim expanded its business operations into new territories, including China and South Korea, and enhanced\nits previously existing operations in other territories. These growth activities contributed to the increase in licensing revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In EMEA, licensing revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2003 increased 75% to $3.6 million, from $2.1 million for\nthe nine months ended December 31, 2002. EMEA experienced increased licensing revenues from the reseller and OEM channels. Increased sales to existing resellers, supplemented by sales to new resellers, helped to drive licensing revenues higher.\nFurthermore, licensing revenues increased due to the geographic expansion of our operations in EMEA, most notably in Germany and France. The growth in OEM licensing revenues was due to the strength of our worldwide relationship with NCR, which\naccounted for a majority of EMEA\x92s OEM licensing revenues during the nine months ended December 31, 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Service Revenues ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In North America, service revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2003 increased 72% to $1.9\xa0million, from $1.1 million for the nine months\nended December 31, 2002. In the Pacific Rim, service revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2003 grew 155% to $920,000, from $361,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2002. In EMEA, service revenues for the nine months ended December\n31, 2003 increased 125% to $849,000, from $378,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2002. The worldwide growth in service revenues is directly related to increased licensing revenues from sales to new customers and to maintenance contract\nrenewals from existing customers. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Development Software\nSolutions Revenues ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We have also entered into multiple\nelement arrangements with certain OEM customers under which, in addition to providing software licenses and maintenance services, we make a commitment to the customer to ', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'9 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'provide unspecified future software products. As VSOE of fair value cannot be determined for the unspecified future software products, all sales amounts\nprocured under these arrangements are initially deferred and subsequently recognized ratably over the arrangement period. Revenues recognized under these arrangements are included under \x93Development Software Solutions\x94 in Note 5 to the\nconsolidated financial statements. We recognized $375,000 in Development Software Solutions revenues during the nine months ended December 31, 2003. We did not recognize any such revenues during the nine months ended December 31, 2002. ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Cost of Revenues ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Cost of revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2003 totaled $2.2\nmillion with a gross margin of 88%, compared with cost of revenues of $1.1 million with a gross margin of 91% for the nine months ended December 31, 2002. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The increase in cost of revenues in absolute dollars was due to the overall increases in sales volume, customer support headcount and third party software\nlicense royalties. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The increase in cost of revenues as a\npercent of total revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2003 compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2002 was due primarily to additional customer support headcount and to timing differences between the recognition of certain\ndevelopment software solutions revenues and related third-party royalties. Although we are required to defer the total arrangement value and recognize the related revenue over the arrangement period, third-party software license royalties are due\nupon our procurement of development software solutions sales. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Sales and Marketing Expenses ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Sales and\nmarketing expenses increased approximately $1.9 million, or 21%, to $11.0 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2003, from $9.1 million for the nine months ended December 31, 2002. The increase was attributed primarily to increases in\nheadcount, commissions and bonuses, and marketing costs associated with the release of a new product version. Headcount increased primarily in the Pacific Rim and EMEA, as we expanded our sales operations in those regions. The increase in\nperformance-based payments was a direct function of revenue growth during the nine months ended December 31, 2003. Furthermore, the increase in sales and marketing expenses was driven by travel, advertising and promotional costs surrounding the\nintroduction of NetVault 7.0, which was released during the first quarter of fiscal 2004. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the nine months ended December 31, 2003 decreased to 57%, from 73% for the nine months ended December 31, 2002.

The overall decrease was due primarily to a reduction in headcount surrounding the November 2002 \x93end\nof life\x94 of the MagnaVault product line. We have made recent research and development hires; however, as of December 31, 2003, we had not reached the pre-November 2002 research and development headcount level.

The decrease in general and administrative expenses relates mainly to the decrease in professional service expenses. During the nine\nmonths ended December 31, 2002, we incurred significant, non-recurring legal and accounting costs in conjunction with the rearrangement of our corporate structure, through which we reduced the number of subsidiaries from seven to four. Furthermore,\nwe incurred additional legal costs in connection with an external review of our intellectual property portfolio, which also took place during the nine months ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was offset partially by increased legal, accounting\nand insurance costs during the nine months ended December 31, 2003. We incurred additional expense for compliance activities surrounding changing securities laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure,\nincluding the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

primarily through private placements and public offerings of equity instruments in the\nProvinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario, Canada, and through private placements in the United States. Most recently, during fiscal 2004, we raised proceeds of approximately $13.6 million, net of approximately $2.1 million in aggregate\noffering costs, which were paid during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2004, through the issuance of 22,000,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock (Preferred Shares) at CDN$1.00 per share. Other sources of liquidity include\nexternal sources of funds, including issuances of common stock resulting from the exercise of warrants and stock options, and cash from operations. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Cash from operations is derived primarily from cash collected on software license and PCS contract sales. Net cash provided by operating activities was\n$27,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2003, compared to net cash used in operations of $1.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2002. The net increase in cash provided by operations between the periods reflects the increase in\nsales volume while operating expenses remained relatively constant. As our sales volume has grown, we have experienced a correlated increase in cash inflows from collections on sales arrangements. The increase in sales volume during the three months\nended December 31, 2003 also led to an increase in our accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances. Based on the payment terms of our licensing arrangements, service contract agreements, and development software solutions arrangements, and the\ntiming of related revenue recognition, our cash receipts will not always coincide with the recognition of revenue. Thus, given an increase in sales volume, we expect our accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances to increase. We expect to\nincrease cash provided by operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and in fiscal 2005 through continued revenue growth combined with moderate increases in operating expenses. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Net cash used in operating activities was $620,000 and $5.5 million for the nine months ended December\xa031, 2003 and\n2002, respectively. Although we achieved an operating cash flow deficit during both periods, the net decrease in cash used in operations between the periods reflects the increase in sales volume while total operating expense remained relatively\nconstant. As our sales volume has grown, we have experienced a correlated increase in cash inflows from sales arrangements and a decrease in our net loss. The increase in sales volume during the nine months ended December 31, 2003 also served to\nincrease our accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances. Based on the payment terms of our development software solutions arrangements, licensing sales and service contract agreements, and timing of the related revenue recognition, our cash\nreceipts will not always coincide with the recognition of revenue. For development software solutions arrangements, we bill and collect substantially all of the arrangement amount and pay related software license royalties at the beginning of the\narrangement period, and are required to defer the total arrangement value and recognize the related revenue over the arrangement period. Thus, given an increase in sales volume, we expect our accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances to\nincrease.

', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended December 31, 2003 of $490,000 consisted primarily of cash inflows generated by warrant\nand stock option exercises. Warrants associated with the private placement that closed in January 2003 were scheduled to expire on December 31, 2003, thus many warrant holders exercised their respective warrants in the third quarter of fiscal 2004.\nFurthermore, a recent increase in our stock price triggered an increase in stock option exercise activity during the three months ended December 31, 2003. This increase was offset partially by aggregate payments of $633,000 and $22,000 related to\nequity offering costs and capital lease obligations, respectively.

These cash inflows were supplemented by $45,000 received in connection with the exercise of stock options and were offset partially by $60,000 in payments on capital lease obligations. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We generated significant cash from financing activities during the nine\nmonths ended December 31, 2003. In July 2003, we raised proceeds of approximately $13.6 million, net of approximately $2.1 million in offering costs, through the issuance of the Preferred Shares. Furthermore, we generated financing cash flows of\n$1.1\xa0million and $446,000 from the exercise of warrants and stock options, respectively, during the nine months ended December 31, 2003. These cash inflows were offset partially by the $1.7 million repayment of a term loan and $112,000 in\npayments on capital lease obligations. Cash provided by financing activities of $2.1 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2002 consisted primarily of $1.4 million from the exercise of purchase warrants associated with a fiscal 2002\nprivate placement, $196,000 in proceeds from the fiscal 2003 private placement, and the release of $804,000 in restricted cash amounts. These cash inflows were offset partially by payments of $187,000 and $144,000 related to notes payable and\ncapital lease obligations, respectively. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Currently we have no\nmaterial cash commitments other than our normal recurring trade payables, expense accruals and operating and capital leases, all of which are currently expected to be funded through existing working capital and future cash flows from operations.\nAside from these recurring operating expenses, we do not expect to dedicate significant resources to capital expenditures. We estimate uses of cash in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 to include capital expenditures for equipment of approximately\n$75,000. We anticipate continued growth of our business and expansion of our business operations into current and new territories, as well as headcount additions in both the sales and research and development functions, in the fourth quarter of 2004\nand into fiscal 2005. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We believe that our cash and cash\nequivalent balances will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. Although we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation or foreign exchange markets on our operations, we do not believe these\nexternal economic forces have had, or are likely in the foreseeable future to have, a material impact on our results of operations. We are focused on preserving and improving cash and our overall liquidity position by growing revenues, managing our\naccounts receivable, and continuously monitoring expenses.

In addition, we did not engage in trading activities involving on-exchange traded contracts. As a result, we are not exposed to any\nfinancing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.

Our existing and future competitors could introduce products with superior features, scalability and functionality at lower prices than our products. Our competitors could gain market share by bundling existing or new products with other\nmore established products or by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our other competitors. If our competitors are successful in gaining market share, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our revenues will decline significantly if the market\ndoes not continue to accept our NetVault product.

Factors that may affect the market acceptance of our NetVault product include the performance, price and total cost of ownership of our product and the availability,\nfunctionality and price of competing products and technologies. Many of these factors are beyond our control. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We derive a significant amount of revenues from only a few customers. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We have derived, and believe we will continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of\ncustomers. Most notably, one customer accounted for approximately 13% and 14%, respectively, of consolidated revenues during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2003. If any of our key customers were to reduce purchases from us, our\nbusiness would be adversely affected. In addition, we do not have contracts with our key customers that require such customers to purchase a specified number of software licenses from us. Therefore, we cannot be sure that these customers will\ncontinue to purchase our products at current levels. As a result, a significant reseller in one period may decide not to purchase our product in a subsequent period, which would have an adverse impact on our revenues. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our quarterly revenues may fluctuate significantly, which could cause\nthe market price of our stock to be extremely volatile. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We may experience a shortfall in revenues in any given quarter in relation to our plans or investor expectations. Any such shortfall in revenues could cause the market price of our stock to fall substantially. Our revenues in general, and\nour licensing revenues in particular, are difficult to forecast and are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control.

', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'You should not rely on the results of any prior periods as an indication of\nour future performance. If we have a shortfall in revenues in any given quarter, our efforts to reduce our operating expenses in response will likely lag behind the revenues shortfall. Therefore, any significant shortfall in revenues will likely\nhave an immediate adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter.

We expect to continue to grow our operations domestically and internationally, and to hire additional employees. The growth in our operations and staff has\nplaced, and will continue to place, a significant strain on our management systems and resources. If we fail to manage our future anticipated growth, we may experience higher operating expenses, and we may be unable to meet the expectations of\nsecurities analysts or investors with respect to future operating results. To manage this growth we must continue to: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'improve our financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'add and integrate new employees; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'control expenses; and ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'integrate geographically dispersed operations.

Any failure to manage our growth effectively could seriously harm our business and operating\nresults. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Inability to protect our technologies could\naffect our ability to compete. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We may receive claims\nthat we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. As the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products continue to overlap, we become increasingly susceptible to infringement claims,\nincluding patent, trademark and copyright infringement claims. In addition, past employers of former, current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of\nthese past employers. Any such claim, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management\x92s attention from our core business, require us to stop selling or delay shipping our product, or\ncause the redesign of our product. In addition, we may be required to pay monetary amounts as damages, for royalty or licensing arrangements, or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We license and use software from third parties in our business. These third\nparty software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms. Also, these third parties may from time to time receive claims that they have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, including patent and copyright\ninfringement claims, which may affect our ability to continue licensing this software. Our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business, which could materially and adversely\naffect our operating results. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Inability to protect our\nproprietary information will adversely affect our business. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other measures to protect our proprietary information. All of these measures afford only limited protection.\nThese measures may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged, and others may develop technologies or processes that are similar or superior to our technology. We license some of our products under \x93shrink wrap\x94 license agreements that do\nnot require a physical signature by the end user licensee and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy our products or to\nobtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'16 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Our products have a short product life cycle. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Software products typically have a limited life cycle and it is difficult to\nestimate when they will become obsolete. We must therefore continually develop and introduce innovative new products and/or upgraded versions of our existing products before the current software has completed its life cycle. If we are unable to keep\npace with the need to supply new products or to enhance existing products, we may not be able to achieve and sustain the level of sales required for success. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our foreign operations and sales create unique challenges that could\nadversely affect our operating results. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'An investment\nin our securities involves greater risk than an investment in many other businesses because we have significant operations outside of the United States, including engineering, sales and client services, and it is our intention to expand these\ninternational operations. As of December 31, 2003, we had 50 employees in EMEA and 36 employees in the Pacific Rim. Our foreign operations are subject to a number of risks, including: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy, misappropriation or weaker laws regarding intellectual property protection; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'imposition of foreign laws and other governmental controls, including trade restrictions; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'unexpected domestic and international political or regulatory changes; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic instability such as higher interest rates and inflation, which could reduce our customers\x92 ability to obtain financing for\nsoftware products or which could make our product more expensive in those countries; and ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'difficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In addition, our foreign sales are substantially denominated in their\nrespective local currency, creating risk of foreign currency translation gains and losses that could adversely affect our business and operating results. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We rely on competing equipment manufacturers as a material source of revenues. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'A portion of our revenues comes from OEMs that incorporate our storage management software into their hardware solution.\nRisks associated with OEM relationships include: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'we have no control over the shipping dates or volumes of systems they ship; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'they have no obligation to recommend or offer our software products; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'they may generally have no minimum sales requirements and can terminate our relationship at any time or upon short notice; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'they could choose to develop their own data availability products and incorporate those products into their systems instead of our products; ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'they could develop enhancements to and derivative products from our products; and ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'they could change their own base products, which could make it difficult for us to adapt our products to theirs. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'17 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Finally, our OEM customers compete with one another. If one of our OEM customers views the products we\nhave developed for another OEM as competing with its products, they might decide to stop doing business with us, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our success depends on our ability to develop new and enhanced products that achieve widespread market acceptance.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our future success depends on our ability to address\nthe rapidly changing needs of customers by developing and introducing new products, product updates and services on a timely basis, by extending the operation of our products on new platforms, and by keeping pace with technological developments and\nemerging industry standards. In order to grow our business, we are committing substantial resources to develop software products and services for the SAN market and the NAS market. Each of these markets is new and industry standards for these\nmarkets are evolving and changing. If these markets do not develop as anticipated, or demand for our products in these markets fails to materialize or occurs more slowly than we expect, we will have expended substantial resources and capital without\nrealizing sufficient revenue, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Existing strategic alliances may be terminated and we may be unable to develop new relationships. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our growth and marketing strategies are based, in part, on seeking out and\nforming strategic alliances with third-party suppliers, VARs, VADs, OEMs and other businesses integral to our future success. None of our channel partners or OEMs has any obligation to continue selling our products and any of them may terminate\ntheir relationship with us at any time. We cannot assure you that existing strategic alliances will not be terminated or modified in the future nor can we assure you that we will be able to develop new relationships. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'A portion of our revenues comes from OEM sales that incorporate our storage\nmanagement software into the OEM hardware solution. We have no control over the shipping dates or volumes of systems the OEMs ship and they have no obligation to ship systems incorporating our software. They also have no obligation to recommend or\noffer our software products exclusively or at all. These OEMs also could choose to bundle competitors\x92 products in lieu of our product. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We expect a large portion of our revenues will come from our channel partners across the world. These partners have no obligation to establish a sales\nrelationship or to continue selling any of our products and can terminate the relationship with us at any time upon written notice as described in the related channel partner agreements. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our products may contain significant defects, which may result in liability and/or decreased sales.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Software products frequently contain errors or\nfailures, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. Despite our best efforts to test our products, we might experience significant errors or failures in our products, or they might not work with other hardware or software\nas expected, which could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and adversely affect market acceptance of our existing products. End-user customers use our products for applications that are critical to their\nbusinesses, and they have a greater sensitivity to product defects than the market for other software products generally. Our customers may claim that we are responsible for damages to the extent they are harmed by the failure of any of our\nproducts. If we were to experience significant delays in the release of new products or new versions of products, or if customers were dissatisfied with product functionality or performance, we could lose revenue or be subject to liability for\nservice or warranty costs, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'18 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'We may require additional capital and raising such capital will dilute our shareholders\x92\nownership interest in us.

Internally generated funds, when combined with current cash and cash equivalents, may not be sufficient to cover our liquidity requirements, and in that case, we may require additional capital. In\nthe case that we do require additional capital, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms satisfactory to us or at all. If we raise additional capital or arrange for debt financing\nthrough mechanisms, which involve additional issuance of our stock, control of the Company may change and shareholders will experience dilution to their equity interests in the Company.

', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Changing laws, regulations and standards\nrelating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and new United States and/or Canadian securities regulations are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours. These new or changed securities laws,\nregulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity. As a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which\ncould result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public\ndisclosure. As a result, we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving securities laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and\nattention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new or changed securities laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities\nrelated to practice, our reputation may be harmed. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We\nmay be unable to hire and retain qualified employees.

If we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees, our business and operating results\nmay be adversely affected. We need to hire and retain sales, technical, and management personnel to support the planned expansion of our business and to meet the anticipated increased customer demand for our products and services. Competition for\npeople with the skills we require is intense, particularly in the San Diego area where our headquarters is located, and the high cost of living in this area makes our recruiting and compensation costs higher.

', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Revenue adjustments ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The financial statements for the first three quarters of fiscal 2004 did not properly reflect the appropriate revenue recognition for certain customer\narrangements. Specifically, under certain OEM arrangements, the Company makes a commitment to the customer to provide unspecified future software products. As VSOE of fair value cannot be determined for the unspecified future software products, the\nCompany determined that all sales amounts procured under these arrangements be initially deferred and subsequently recognized ratably over the arrangement period. Therefore, previously reported revenues totaling $671,000 and $3.1 million,\nrespectively, recognized in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2003 were reclassified to deferred revenue. Furthermore, for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2003, $193,000 and $375,000, respectively, of revenue was recognized\nunder these arrangements and is classified as \x93Development Software Solutions\x94 as described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Furthermore, the Company determined that revenues of $55,000 and $39,000, respectively, recognized initially during the third and fourth quarters of\nfiscal 2003 should have been deferred as of March 31, 2003. During the three and nine months ended December 31, 2003, $14,000 and $81,000, respectively, of this deferred revenue was recognized. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In connection with the Company\x92s 53% step acquisition of BakBone KK in\nMarch 2002, the Company recorded 100 percent of BakBone KK\x92s deferred revenue balances that existed on the date of the step acquisition. An adjustment was made to record these deferred revenue balances at fair value on the date of the\nacquisition, which led to corresponding adjustments that decreased service revenues by $45,000 and $134,000 during the three and nine months ended December 31, 2002, respectively. These adjustments were made to conform to accounting rules and\ninterpretations regarding acquisition transactions that require recognition of deferred revenue only to the extent it represents a legal obligation assumed by the acquiring entity. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Stock-based compensation ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The adjustment to stock-based compensation was $210,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2002. The Company identified instances where certain equity\ninstruments granted to non-employees during the year ended March 31, 2003 were valued using a Black-Scholes model assumption that was incorrect. The Company re-calculated these amounts and recorded an additional $210,000 in stock-based compensation\nduring the nine months ended December 31, 2002.

', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The $33,000 reversal of legal expenses during the nine months ended December\n31, 2003 represents the reversal of legal expenses accrued as part of a restatement as of March 31, 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The adjustment to other operating expenses was $222,000 for the nine months ended December 31, 2002. The restatement adjustment included in the nine\nmonths ended December 31, 2002 relates to the incurrence of $222,000 additional rent expense. This expense was recorded originally as of March 31, 2002 in connection with an unused facility liability; however, the criteria for liability and expense\nrecognition were not met as of March\xa031, 2002. Thus, the $222,000 in rent expense was reversed during the three months ended March 31, 2002 and recorded during the nine months ended December 31, 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Other expense ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The adjustments to other expense were $13,000 and $41,000 in the three and\nnine months ended December\xa031, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The original purchase price of the Company\x92s 53% step acquisition of BakBone KK allocated no value to separately identified intangible assets. The Company has since determined\nthat $222,000 in amortizable intangible assets should have been recorded, with the intangible assets being amortized over the assets\x92 useful life of four years. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Weighted-average common shares outstanding ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The Company determined that the number of weighted-average shares outstanding, which is used to calculate basic and diluted\nearnings per share, required adjusting for the three and nine months ended December\xa031, 2003 and 2002. Historically, the Company considered certain shares to be contingently issuable for purposes of calculating the number of weighted-average\nshares outstanding In accordance with the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants Handbook (CICA) Section 3500, ', u'Earnings Per Share', u', contingently issuable shares are included in the calculation of the number of weighted-average shares only\nafter the contingent event has been satisfied. Upon further review, the Company determined that these shares were improperly classified as contingently issuable, thus, the number of weighted-averaged shares outstanding was adjusted accordingly. As a\nresult, the number of weighted-average common shares was increased by 847 and 666,635 for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2003, respectively, and increased by 3,770,648 and 3,013,364 the three and nine months ended December 31, 2002,\nrespectively.
