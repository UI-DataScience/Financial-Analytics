(NASDAQ: LANV)\ntoday announced the financial results for the second quarter and first six\nmonths ended July 31, 2004.\n\n\n\nRevenues for the second quarter were $2,558,295 compared with $2,966,590\nreported in the second quarter of last year. The operating loss for the second\nquarter of fiscal 2004 was ($83,922), compared with operating income of $646,559\nin the second quarter of fiscal 2003. The net loss for the quarter was\n($462,328), or ($0.05) per basic and diluted common share, compared with net\nearnings of $213,596, or $0.02 per basic and diluted common share in the second\nquarter of fiscal 2003.\n\nRevenues for the first six months were $5,199,850, compared with $5,586,572\nreported in the first six months of last year. The operating loss for the first\nsix months of fiscal 2004 was ($125,639) compared with operating income of\n$398,542 in the comparable prior period. The net loss for the first six months\nwas ($883,391), or ($0.10) per basic and diluted common share, compared with net\nloss of ($462,196), or ($0.05) per basic and diluted common share in the first\nsix months of last year.\n\nSecond Quarter Highlights included:\n\n              payment of the high interest rate 1998 long-term debt and the\n              related accrued and unpaid interest at maturity on July 30, 2004,\n              and replacement of this debt with a $3.5 million working capital\n              term loan, at Prime plus 2% (6.50%) payable in annual installments\n              over three years,\n\n\n                                       3\n', u'\n\n\n              the successful pilot of LanVision\'s codingANYware at the\n              Charleston Naval Hospital, and\n              FORTUNE Small Business Magazine named LanVision as one of\n              America\'s 100 fastest-growing small companies in America in its\n              fourth annual ranking.\n\n\nBrian Patsy, LanVision\'s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Our\ncurrent quarter and first six months operations followed our traditional\ncyclical pattern, with a greater portion of our annual licensing revenues\nrecorded in our later two quarters. The quarterly operating results reflect\nprimarily a decline in high margin add-on software licensing revenues to\nexisting customers and the delayed purchasing decisions on new customer sales,\noffset to some extent with increased application-hosting revenues, when compared\nto the prior comparable period. Because the size of deals and the timing of\nrevenue recognition on software licensing significantly affects operating\nresults, the comparability of operating results among fiscal quarters can be\nskewed. The current sales pipeline continues to contain significant new\nopportunities that we anticipate closing during the remainder of the fiscal\nyear. Our ASPeN(SM) application service provider (ASP) based recurring revenues\ncontinue to grow as we expand our distribution and the direct sales of our\napplication-hosting services such as codingANYware(TM). Based on our current\nprojections for the second half of the fiscal year, we believe that net new\nsoftware revenues from the current sales pipeline and ASP hosting services\nshould increase. The anticipated increase in new software licensing and ASP\nhosting revenues combined with lower interest as a result refinancing our debt\nat a significantly more favorable rate should enable us to be profitable in the\nremaining two quarters."\n\nRegarding the current sales pipeline for the second half of the year, Mr. Patsy\nfurther commented, "We have a robust sales pipeline of direct and indirect\nopportunities that we anticipate will close in the second half of our fiscal\nyear, including several large government sector codingANYware remote hosting\nopportunities. In addition, we will be rolling out an important new entry level\ndocument management solution for Emergency Departments (EDView(TM)) in September\nthrough a joint distribution arrangement with Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE:\nIRM). We anticipate piloting EDView at 2 or 3 mutual customer sites soon."\n\nMr. Patsy continued, "As noted in our announcement of the retirement of our high\ninterest rate debt, based on the anticipated prime rate and outstanding loan\nbalance during the second half of the current fiscal year, the anticipated\ninterest expense will be $109,600 compared with $955,800 in the second half of\nthe prior fiscal year or a reduction in interest expense of $846,200, or\napproximately $0.09 per share, pre tax, for the second half of the current\nfiscal year. For the next fiscal year (2005), the annual interest expense is\nanticipated to be approximately $148,000 compared with $908,000 anticipated for\nthe current fiscal-year (2004), or a reduction of approximately $760,000 in\ninterest expense."\n\nMr. Patsy Concluded, "We believe that we are on course to achieve improved\noperating results in the final six months of the current fiscal year."\n\n', u'\n\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nIn conjunction with LanVision\'s Second Quarter Fiscal 2004 earnings release, you\nare invited to listen to its conference call, which will be broadcast live over\nthe Internet on September 8, 2004, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time, at\nhttp://www.lanvision.com.\n\nABOUT LANVISION SYSTEMS\n\nLanVision is a healthcare information technology company focused on digitally\nstreamlining healthcare by providing solutions that improve document-centric\ninformation flows while complementing and enhancing existing transaction-centric\nhealthcare information systems. The Company\'s workflow and document management\nsolutions bridge the gap between current, inefficient paper-based processes and\ntransaction-based healthcare information systems by 1) electronically capturing\ndocument-centric information from disparate sources, 2) electronically directing\nthat information through vital business processes, and 3) providing access to\nthe information for authenticated users (such as physicians, nurses,\nadministrative and financial personnel and payers) across the continuum of care.\n\nThe company\'s workflow-based products and services offer unique solutions to\nspecific healthcare business processes within the Medical Record life cycle and\nthe revenue cycle, such as remote coding, abstracting and chart completion,\nremote physician order processing, pre-admission registration scanning,\ninsurance verification, financial screening, secondary billing services,\nexplanation of benefits processing and release of information processing.\n\nLanVision\'s products and services also create an integrated document-centric\nrepository of historical health information that is complementary and can be\nseamlessly "bolted on" to existing transaction-centric clinical, financial and\nmanagement information systems, allowing healthcare providers to aggressively\nmove toward fully Electronic Medical Record (EMR) processes while improving\nservice levels and convenience for all stakeholders. These integrated systems\nallow providers and administrators to dramatically improve the availability of\npatient information while decreasing direct costs associated with document\nretrieval, work-in-process, chart completion, document retention and archiving.\n\nLanVision\'s systems can be provided on a subscription basis via remote hosting\nservices or installed locally. LanVision provides ASPEN, ASP-based remote\nhosting services to The University Hospital, a member of The Health Alliance of\nGreater Cincinnati, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and Children\'s Medical Center\nof Columbus, Ohio among others.
