"Net income continued to improve,\nextending the upward trend that began a year ago.  The quarter\nalso marked the first positive revenue comparison in several\nyears.  Our first quarter performance provides significant\nevidence that opportunities for Electro Rent that were only on\nthe horizon last year are now taking root in the marketplace,"\nsaid Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel Greenberg.\n\n\nFirst Quarter Results\n  For the three months ended August 31, 2004, revenue increased\n13% to $25.6 million from $22.7 million for the first quarter of\nfiscal 2004.  Net income increased to $5.6 million, or $0.22 per\ndiluted share, which included $1.8 million (pre-tax) related to\nfunds received from a class action lawsuit.  This compares to net\nincome for the same period last year of $2.1 million, or $0.09\nper diluted share.\n\n\nOperations Review\n  "We are seeing strength across the entire spectrum of our test\nand measurement business, especially in wireless communications,\naerospace/defense and manufacturing.  Rental and lease demand and\nrates in our data products business also improved modestly in the\nfirst quarter," Greenberg said.\n  Greenberg noted that SG&A expenses declined by $439,000, or\n5.6%, during the first quarter despite the increase in revenue.\n"The many steps we took during the difficult past few years to\nreduce our costs and increase our operating efficiencies, as well\nas to enhance customer service and prepare for new market\nopportunities, have come together to serve us in good stead.  We\nbelieve that we can now significantly increase our volume this\nyear while holding the line on expenses," he said.\n  "With the improvement in the business climate creating new\nopportunities for us to profitably deploy our assets, new\nequipment purchases have increased in recent months and we\n\n                              (more)\n\n\nElectro Rent Corporation Reports Higher Revenue and Net Income\nfor Fiscal 2005 First Quarter Versus Prior Year\nSeptember 16, 2004\nPage Two\n\ncurrently are investing rather than accumulating cash," Greenberg\nnoted.  Purchases of new equipment for this year\'s first quarter\nincreased to $21.8 million, compared to $10.3 million for the\nfirst quarter of fiscal 2004, while cash and marketable\nsecurities declined to $76.1 million from $82.2 million at May\n31, 2004.  The book value of Electro Rent\'s equipment pool rose\nto $107.0 million at August 31, 2004 compared to $96.3 million at\nMay 31, 2004 and $86.3 million at August 31, 2003.\n  Electro Rent has no debt, and shareholders\' equity at August\n31, 2004 was $174.3 million.\n\n\nAbout Electro Rent\n  Electro Rent Corporation (www.ElectroRent.com) is one of the\nlargest nationwide organizations devoted to the short-term rental\nand leasing of personal computers, servers and general purpose\nelectronic test equipment.\n\n\n"Safe Harbor" Statement:\n  Except for the historical statements and discussions above, our\nstatements above constitute forward-looking statements within the\nmeaning of section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nThese forward-looking statements reflect our management\'s current\nviews with respect to future events and financial performance;\nhowever, you should not put undue reliance on these statements.\nWhen used, the words "anticipates," "believes," "expects,"\n"intends," "future," and other similar expressions identify\nforward-looking statements.
