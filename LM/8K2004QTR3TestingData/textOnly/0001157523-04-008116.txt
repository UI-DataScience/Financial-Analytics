Switz,\npresident and CEO of ADC. "We are now focused on our core business of\nconnecting communications everywhere - from the communications\nproviders\' operations centers to residential, mobile and enterprise\nsubscribers. This is a business we know how to do profitably around\nthe globe with great product and service solutions and strong customer\nrelationships."\n\n    Discontinued Operations and KRONE Acquisition\n\n    On May 18, 2004, ADC completed the acquisition of the KRONE Group\nand in the third fiscal quarter of 2004 accounted for this acquisition\nunder the purchase accounting method. Beginning in the third fiscal\nquarter of 2004, ADC classified as discontinued operations the\nbusiness related to the Cuda(TM) cable modem termination system\nproduct line and the operations related to the FastFlow(R) Broadband\nProvisioning Manager software, which were both divested on June 29,\n2004, and the business related to the Singl.eView(R) customer care and\nbilling software. ADC expects to finalize the Singl.eView divestiture\nduring its fourth fiscal quarter. These new discontinued operations\nare in addition to the BroadAccess40 business that was classified as a\ndiscontinued operation beginning in the first fiscal quarter of 2004.\n\n\n\nGAAP Results (dollars in millions, except per share amounts),\n Continuing Operations\n\n                                             2004     2004     2003\n                                             Third   Second    Third\nADC Results                                 Quarter  Quarter  Quarter\n- -----------                                 -------  -------  -------\nNet sales                                 $   235.2    160.7    152.2\n   Percent outside U.S.                        47.3%    32.7%    31.2%\nGross margin                                   37.9%    41.1%    37.5%\nOperating income (loss)                   $     3.2     (3.6)    (0.9)\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations  $     3.2     (3.3)    (2.6)\nEarnings (loss) per share from continuing\n operations - basic and diluted           $    0.00     0.00     0.00\n\nSegment Results\n- ---------------\nNet sales:\n   BIA                                    $   182.9    119.2    106.9\n   IS                                     $    58.2     45.4     51.4\n   Eliminations and corporate             $    (5.9)    (3.9)    (6.1)\nOperating income (loss):\n   BIA                                    $    20.0     20.3      7.1\n   IS                                     $    (2.5)    (2.6)     2.5\n   Eliminations and corporate             $   (14.3)   (21.3)   (10.5)\n\n\n    Adjusted Results (dollars in millions, except per share amounts),\nContinuing Operations\n\n    In addition to GAAP income statement results from continuing\noperations, ADC also presents adjusted income statement results from\ncontinuing operations prepared with certain adjustments as noted in\nthis release. Due to the significance of ADC\'s restructuring\nactivities from fiscal 2000 to 2004, management believes that a more\nmeaningful comparison of fiscal 2004 results would exclude impairment\nand restructuring charges and certain nonoperating gains/losses in\nderiving adjusted income statements from continuing operations for\nfiscal 2004 and historical periods.

"Since closing the\nKRONE acquisition in the third quarter, ADC and KRONE employees have\nbeen meeting to develop detailed plans for revenue synergies and cost\nreductions in the global business.

The resulting cash\nand securities balance is sufficient for organic growth plans for\nADC\'s core business as $200 million of convertible notes do not mature\nuntil June 15, 2008, and the other $200 million of convertible notes\ndoes not mature until June 15, 2013.

In the nine months ended July 31,\n2003, total cash provided by operating activities of continuing\noperations was primarily from positive cash earnings and a reduction\nin working capital during the industry downturn.\n    Total employees were approximately 8,150 as of July 31, 2004\ncompared to approximately 5,900 as of April 30, 2004 and approximately\n5,800 as of July 31, 2003. The increase in employees from April 30,\n2004 was primarily a result of the KRONE acquisition.\n\n    Review of Operating Segments\n\n    Sales from ADC\'s operating segments from continuing operations are\nsummarized above. Commentary on the changes in the sales results\nfollows.\n\n    Broadband Infrastructure and Access\n\n    On a quarterly sequential basis from the second quarter of 2004,\nBIA sales of $183 million in the third quarter of 2004 were $64\nmillion higher primarily as a result of the KRONE acquisition that was\nfinalized on May 18, 2004. Comparing third quarters on a\nyear-over-year basis, BIA sales were $76 million higher as a result of\nthe addition of KRONE sales as well as 20% growth in ADC\'s historic\nconnectivity sales and 73% growth in wireless sales being partially\noffset by lower sales of wireline systems. Sales of ADC\'s historic\nconnectivity and wireless systems have each increased year-over-year\nfor four quarters in a row.\n\n    Integrated Solutions\n\n    On a quarterly sequential basis from the second quarter of 2004,\nIS sales of $58 million in the third quarter of 2004 increased by $13\nmillion primarily as a result of the addition of KRONE services sales\nand growth in sales of ADC\'s historic systems integration services.\nComparing third quarters on a year-over-year basis, 2004 sales for IS\nincreased by $7 million as a result of the addition of KRONE services\nsales partially offset by lower sales for both ADC\'s historic systems\nintegration services and software systems.\n\n    Recent Wins and Achievements\n\n    ADC\'s wins and achievements in recent months are summarized below.\n\n    Connectivity\n\n    Worldwide, ADC is targeting sophisticated, high-performance\nnetworks and data centers with a portfolio of IP Infrastructure\nsolutions including:\n\n    --  10-Gigabit per second Ethernet Solutions -- ADC\'s new\n        CopperTen(TM) system is the world\'s first augmented Category 6\n        structured cabling system with the necessary characteristics\n        to enable 10-Gigabit per second Ethernet transmission over a\n        full 100 meters. Typical Category 6 cabling systems are\n        hindered by the technical combination of insertion loss and\n        alien crosstalk that greatly disrupts transmission and\n        high-speed data communications. The CopperTen system\n        incorporates patent-pending design and manufacturing processes\n        that enable the products to overcome these challenges using\n        unshielded twisted pair cable, the most prolific type of\n        enterprise network cabling in the world.\n\n    --  Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) Infrastructure Solutions -- The new\n        ADC Midspan Power-over-Ethernet Controller eliminates the need\n        for installation of local power to devices such as VoIP phones\n        and Wi-Fi access points, saving time and money.

With the KRONE\nacquisition and the divestitures announced through the third quarter\nof 2004, ADC has significantly altered its overall product portfolio.\nADC\'s product portfolio review will be an ongoing process however.\nWithout giving effect to any potential additional portfolio changes,\nADC currently estimates that sales in the fourth quarter of 2004 will\nbe around $250-$260 million and adjusted earnings per share will be\naround $0.01-$0.02.\n    ADC is not able to provide an outlook for GAAP earnings per share\nat this time for the reasons explained below. ADC cautions investors\nthat forecasting remains extremely difficult and subject to change\nbecause of many factors, including soft and changing industry\nconditions, acquisition integration activities, as well as economic,\ngeopolitical and other uncertainties, especially with respect to cost\nreduction activities and the timing of closing and deploying contracts\nthat can delay the start of new sales sources. With the KRONE\nacquisition, internal growth initiatives and potential future product\nline additions, ADC remains focused on its goal of growing profitably\nin its core network infrastructure business and being a leader in each\nmarket served by the company.\n    Starting in the third quarter of 2002, the tax benefits of ADC\'s\npre-tax losses have been added to its deferred tax assets with an\noffsetting valuation reserve. As of July 31, 2004, ADC had a total of\n$863 million in deferred tax assets that have been offset by a nearly\nfull valuation reserve and as a result have been shown on the balance\nsheet at an insignificant amount. As it generates pre-tax income in\nfuture periods, ADC does not currently expect to record significant\nincome tax expense until either its deferred tax assets are fully\nutilized to reduce future income tax liabilities or the value of its\ndeferred tax assets are restored on the balance sheet. Most of the\ndeferred tax assets are not expected to expire until 2022-2024.\n    Adjusted results in this outlook exclude impairment and\nrestructuring charges and certain non-operating gains/losses that may\nbe incurred if ADC takes actions designed to further lower its\nbreakeven point or restructure its operations. ADC is unable to\nprovide an outlook for earnings per share on a GAAP basis at this time\nas ADC may incur such additional impairment and restructuring charges\nand certain non-operating gains/losses in future fiscal quarters. The\namount of any such additional charges is uncertain and will depend on\nmany factors including the evolving outlook for industry conditions\nand ADC\'s businesses. If such charges are incurred they could result\nin a significant difference between GAAP and adjusted earnings per\nshare.\n\n    Adjustment Items Excluded from GAAP Results\n\n    Adjusted income statement results from continuing operations in\nboth fiscal 2004 and 2003 exclude impairment and restructuring\ncharges, and certain non-operating gains/losses.\n    In deriving adjusted results from continuing operations for the\nthird quarter of 2004, ADC excluded net charges of $0.5 million ($0.00\nper share) primarily related to restructuring charges for employee\nreductions partially offset by a non-operating investment gain.\n    In deriving adjusted results from continuing operations for the\nsecond quarter of 2004, ADC excluded net charges of $12 million ($0.01\nper share) primarily related to restructuring charges on facilities\nconsolidations.\n    In deriving adjusted results from continuing operations for the\nthird quarter of 2003, ADC excluded restructuring charges of $7\nmillion ($0.01 per share) primarily related to employee reductions and\nfacilities consolidations.\n\n    Today\'s Earnings Conference Call And Webcast at 5:00 p.m. Eastern\n\n    ADC will discuss its third quarter 2004 results and current\noutlook on a conference call scheduled today, August 25, at 5:00 p.m.\nEastern time.
