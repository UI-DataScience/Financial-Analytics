Results of Operations and Financial Condition. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'As more fully discussed below in Item 4.02, on September 22, 2004, Dynegy Inc.\n(\x93Dynegy\x94), the wholly owning parent of Dynegy Holdings Inc. (the \x93Company\x94), issued a press release announcing that the previously issued financial statements contained in Dynegy\x92s 2003 Form 10-K and first and second\nquarter 2004 Form 10-Qs should not be relied upon because of errors in those financial statements and that those financial statements would be restated to make the necessary accounting adjustments. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'As a result of the adjustments identified in the Dynegy press release relating to\nDynegy\x92s deferred income tax accounts, which the Company expects will similarly impact the Company\x92s deferred income tax accounts, the previously issued financial statements contained in the Company\x92s 2003 Form 10-K and first and\nsecond quarter 2004 Form 10-Qs should also not be relied upon and will also be restated to make the necessary accounting adjustments. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Item 4.02 Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'On September 22, 2004, Dynegy issued a press release announcing that, on September 21, 2004,\nthe Audit and Compliance Committee of Dynegy\x92s Board of Directors (\x93Audit Committee\x94) concluded that the previously issued financial statements contained in Dynegy\x92s 2003 Form 10-K and first and second quarter 2004 Form 10-Qs\nshould not be relied upon because of errors in those financial statements and that Dynegy would restate those financial statements to make the necessary accounting adjustments. The Dynegy restatements relate to (i) Dynegy\x92s previously disclosed\ngoodwill impairment charge associated with the pending sale of Illinois Power Company (\x93Illinois Power\x94) and (ii) Dynegy\x92s deferred income tax accounts. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Although the Company\x92s financial statements are not impacted by the additional impairment charges to be recorded by Dynegy in\nconnection with the Illinois Power sale, as a result of Dynegy\x92s income tax review initiative, the Company has also determined that adjustments related to its deferred income tax accounts in periods prior to 2004 are required. As this deferred\nincome tax review initiative has not been completed, the Company is currently unable to determine with certainty the amount of the adjustments and the periods affected. However, the Company does anticipate, based on the ongoing review of these tax\nitems, that these adjustments will reduce the Company\x92s deferred tax liability reflected on its balance sheet. Dynegy is working to complete this review as expeditiously as possible. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Based upon these matters, the Company expects to file amendments to its 2003 Form 10-K and first and second quarter 2004 Form 10-Qs,\nreflecting all necessary deferred tax adjustments, prior to filing its third quarter 2004 Form 10-Q in November 2004. Accordingly, the referenced financial statements should not be relied upon until such time as the Company files its restatements.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The Dynegy Audit Committee has discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers,\nDynegy\x92s and the Company\x92s independent auditors, the matters disclosed in this Current Report on Form 8-K.
