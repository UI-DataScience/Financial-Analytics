INTERLINK COMPANIES (NASDAQ:\nSORC), the largest direct-to-retail magazine distribution/fulfillment company\nand leading provider of magazine information and front-end management services\nfor retailers, today announced results for the second quarter ended July 31,\n2004.\n\nNet income in the second quarter rose 38.3% to $4.1 million, or $0.17 per\ndiluted share, compared to $2.9 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the same\nperiod last year. Revenue in the second quarter increased 7% to $91.4 million\nfrom $85.5 million in the same period last year. The weighted average shares\noutstanding for the three months ended July 31, 2003, were approximately\n25,026,000 on a fully diluted basis compared to 19,679,000 for the same period\nlast year.\n\nLeslie Flegel, Source Interlink Chairman and Chief Executive officer, said, "The\ncompany\'s strong second quarter results reflect management\'s continued ability\nto execute its strategic growth plan. Our ability to leverage our diverse\noperations led to an increase in pretax profit of 45.4% to $6.1 million in the\nsecond quarter compared to $4.2 million in the same period last year. Operating\nprofit margins improved to 6.7%. The results we have achieved, combined with a\nstrong balance sheet, have provided additional opportunities to grow the\nbusiness and expand our effective direct method for the distribution of\nmagazines within the multi-billion dollar industry. We will also continue to\ndevelop new market opportunities outside of magazines through our unique\nbusiness model and seek strategic acquisitions and other ventures that add value\nto our existing platform. In the second quarter, cash flow from operations\nincreased $8.2 million in the second quarter and the company reported $7.0\nmillion in free cash flow."\n\nInterlink, the company\'s direct-to-retail magazine distribution/fulfillment\ndivision, reported revenue in the second quarter of $70.2 million compared to\n$65.6 million in the same period a year ago, an increase of 7.1%. "The sales\nincrease of approximately $4.6 million in the second quarter was primarily due\nto organic growth, which resulted in our ability to leverage our business and\nincrease profits appreciably. It is important to note these results do not\ninclude business from recent acquisitions or penetration in the mainstream\nmarket on a material basis. Our recently announced expansion in the mainstream\nmarket, which now totals approximately 750 mainstream retail stores on a\nnational basis, will be complemented through two strategic acquisitions, Empire\nNews and PROMAG, which enhance our position in the mainstream market. Empire\ncurrently provides service to an additional 1,000 mainstream retail stores\nrepresented by major chains located along the east coast. Combined with our\nexisting business, this acquisition will enable Interlink to implement its more\nefficient direct distribution model, compared to the\n\n\n', u'\n\ntraditional wholesale method, to a total of just under 2,000 mainstream retail\nstores with the potential to penetrate approximately 30,000 additional stores\nrepresented by the major national and regional chains served," Flegel said.\n\n"During the quarter, we also strengthened our leading position in the specialty\nmarket by signing an exclusive agreement with PRIMEDIA Inc. which will go into\neffect in the fourth quarter. While the second quarter is historically a\ngenerally slower selling period for magazines in bookstores, the division\nremains on track to achieve a record second half, particularly in the fourth\nquarter, and we expect Interlink to come in approximately on budget for the\nyear."\n\nIn-Store Services Division reported revenue of $13.5 million versus $15.9\nmillion in the corresponding period a year ago. "In-Store Services continues to\nbe led by our profitable information management and rebate services businesses.\nResult comparisons in the quarter were impacted negatively by the unusually high\nvolume of wire manufacturing business in last year\'s second quarter compared to\nthis year. Our recent acquisition of the west coast magazine rebate management\nand information businesses from PROMAG provides strong growth and cross-selling\nopportunities for our business, particularly wire manufacturing and\ndistribution, given a client base of 200 retailers, including Safeway,\nAlbertsons, Smith\'s Food & Drug, totaling more than 10,000 stores. This\ntransaction clearly solidifies our position as the number one front-end product\nand service provider for retailers in North America. As we noted earlier, we\nanticipate this acquisition to be slightly accretive to the current fiscal 2005\nearnings and approximately five cents accretive to fiscal 2006 earnings based\nsolely on the rebate business acquired in the transaction," Flegel said.\n\nCustom Wood Manufacturing reported revenue of $7.8 million versus $4.0 million\nin the corresponding period a year ago, an increase of 93.1%. Flegel noted, "In\nthe second quarter, pretax income climbed to $1.2 million compared to $122,000\nin the same quarter last year. The division continues to benefit from a\ncombination of new business agreements and consolidated operations.\n\nFlegel concluded, "We are pleased with our second quarter results and expect a\nstrong performance in the second half of fiscal 2005. As a result of the\nincrease in shares outstanding via 800,000 additional shares sold by the company\ndue to increased demand in our March stock offering and excessive costs relating\nto Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we expect earnings per share to be at\nthe low end of our previously stated guidance of $0.70 to $0.75 per diluted\nshare, exclusive of non-recurring charges. Revenue for the year is expected to\nbe approximately $370 million.\n\n"The company has demonstrated its ability to grow organically while making\nstrategic acquisitions. We have gained from the compounding effect of increased\nsales and reduced costs through the consolidation of our operations, which has\nincreased margins and substantially improved profits. This was evident in our\nsecond quarter results as revenue increased 7% and pretax profits rose 45%. We\nwill continue to acquire companies and enter into strategic alliances that\nbolster our existing client base and provide strong growth opportunities that\nfurther enhance profits and produce greater returns for our shareholders. Our\nefforts to strengthen our competitive position have enabled management to\nsuccessfully build the company, penetrate new markets and collectively increase\nits position in each of the industries it serves."\n\nSource Interlink will broadcast live via the Internet its second quarter\nconference call for fiscal year 2005 today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss\nfinancial results, business developments and future outlook.
