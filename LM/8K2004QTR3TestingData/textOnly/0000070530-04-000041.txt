National\'s  first quarter  sales were 29 percent  higher\nthan the first quarter of fiscal 2004, when the company reported sales of $424.8\nmillion and earnings of 8 cents per share. Sequentially,  National\'s Q1 revenues\nwere 4 percent  lower than the fourth  quarter of fiscal 2004,  when the company\nrecorded revenues of $571 million and earnings of 24 cents per share. National\'s\nfourth quarter 2004 results  included a $30 million pre-tax special charge for a\nlitigation matter.\n\nIn the first  quarter of fiscal  2005,  National  achieved a new record in gross\nmargin of 55 percent,  up from 54.4 percent in the prior quarter.  For the first\nquarter of fiscal 2004, National\'s gross margin was 47 percent.\n\n"National\'s  business  over the summer was  affected  by slower  orders  than we\noriginally anticipated,  particularly from our distribution channel," said Brian\nL. Halla, National\'s chairman, president and CEO. "However, we continued to show\npositive  results from our analog  focus and we\'re  pleased that we were able to\nincrease gross margin in a seasonally slow quarter. As a result of our continued\nfocus on selling  higher-value,  higher  margin  analog  products,  we  provided\nshareholders with a 28 percent return on invested capital (ROIC) in Q1."\n\n\nBOOKINGS PATTERNS FOR Q1\nNational\'s  worldwide  bookings in Q1 were 5 percent higher than last year\'s Q1.\nBut on a sequential basis,  bookings declined 29 percent from the fourth quarter\nof fiscal 2004.\n\nThe decline in bookings was  attributed to a combination  of factors,  including\nseasonally slower demand, shorter lead times --- which prompted distributors and\nOEM customers to reduce backlog  coverage --- and supply chain  corrections from\nflat panel display customers and some wireless handset customers in Asia.\n\nThe   sequential   decline  in  revenues   for  Q1  was   directly   related  to\nlower-than-anticipated  turns  orders,  which were  driven by these same  global\nmarket  developments.  Turns orders are orders requested for delivery within the\nsame quarter.\n\nFrom a geographic market perspective,  Q1 bookings declined  sequentially in all\nregions. Bookings in Europe and Japan were generally stronger than in the United\nStates and Asia Pacific.  Weekly bookings  improved slightly during the month of\nAugust compared to July. Billings exceeded bookings in the first quarter.\n', u'\n\nGUIDANCE FOR Q2, FY2005\nNational  expects  distributors  and some customers to continue  adjusting order\nbacklog and inventories in Q2. As a result, the Company anticipates revenues may\ndecline 8 to 10  percent  sequentially  during  Q2.  This  revenue  range may be\naccompanied by gross margin of  approximately  51 percent.  Operating  expenses,\nmeanwhile, are expected to be comparable to Q1.\n\n"As we work through these inventory adjustments, National will continue to drive\na proven business model that focuses on high-value analog products," Halla said.\n"This slowdown won\'t distract us from pursuing National\'s  long-term  objectives\nto create the best returns for our shareholders."\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\nThis release contains forward-looking  statements dependent on a number of risks\nand  uncertainties  pursuant  to the  safe  harbor  provisions  of  the  Private\nSecurities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995. These factors  include,  but are not\nrestricted to, new orders  received and shipped  during the first  quarter,  the\ndegree  of  factory  utilization,  the  successful  start  up of  production  in\nNational\'s  Suzhou  assembly  and  test  facility,  the sale of  inventories  at\nexisting prices,  and the ramp up of recently  introduced  products.
