RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\n\nOn September 1, 2004, Delta Woodside Industries, Inc. (the "Company") issued a\nfinancial results press release for the fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended\nJuly 3, 2004. This press release is set forth in Exhibit 99.1 to this Current\nReport and is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nThe information in this Item 2.02 and the Exhibit attached hereto shall not be\ndeemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Act of 1934, nor\nshall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities\nAct of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in\nsuch filing.\n\nITEM 2.05.  COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES.\n\nOn August 31, 2004, the board of directors of the Company\'s wholly-owned\nsubsidiary Delta Mills, Inc. approved a contract dated August 24, 2004 for the\nsale of its Furman plant for expected net proceeds of approximately $1.8\nmillion. The sale is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to\nclose within 60 days of the date of the agreement. The Company announced the\nclosing of the Furman plant in fiscal 2002. Consummation of the sale under this\ncontract will complete the disposal of the plant and its related assets. Since\nthe sale price is approximately $847,000 less than the carrying amount of the\nasset on the Company\'s books, the Company determined on August 31, 2004 to take\nan impairment charge at July 3, 2004 with respect to the Furman plant of\napproximately $847,000, which will result in a non-cash charge to earnings of\nthat amount for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 with respect to the Furman\nplant. Other than customary closing costs which the Company does not consider\nmaterial, the Company does not expect there to be any further cash expenditures\nrelated to the disposal of this asset.\n\nITEM 2.06.

ANNOUNCES CERTAIN\n                   FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR 2004 RESULTS\n\n         Delta Woodside Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ-OTC-BB-DLWI) reported net sales\nof $45.4 million for the 14 week quarter ended July 3, 2004, a decrease of 6.8%\nwhen compared to net sales of $48.7 million for the 13 week quarter ended June\n28, 2003. The decrease from the prior year quarter was the result of a 15.8%\nreduction in unit sales partially offset by a 10.1% increase in average sales\nprice. For the 53 week year ended July 3, 2004, the Company reported net sales\nof $174.4 million as compared to net sales of $177.2 million for the previous 52\nweek year ended June 28, 2003. The decrease was the result of a 5.0% decline in\nunit sales partially offset by 3.6% increase in average sales price. Unit sales\ndeclined in both the quarter and year periods primarily as a result of weaker\nretail sales partially offset by improved demand for military fabrics. Product\nmix changes accounted for the increases in average sales price.\n\n         The Company reported gross profit of $1.3 million for the quarter ended\nJuly 3, 2004 compared to gross profit of $4.9 million in the prior year quarter.\nThis decrease was the result of reduced absorption of manufacturing costs due to\nreduced running schedules and deteriorating margins on commodity products due to\ncontinued pressure from imports coupled with over capacity of domestic textile\nproduction, partially offset by an improved product mix. For the year ended July\n3, 2004 the Company reported gross profit of $8.0 million compared to gross\nprofit of $17.0 million for the year ended June 28, 2003. This decrease for the\nyear resulted principally from unabsorbed manufacturing costs associated with\nreduced running schedules brought on by reduced customer demand.\n\n         Selling general and administrative expenses were $3.1 million for the\nquarter ended July 3, 2004 compared to $2.9 million in the prior year quarter.\nThis increase was primarily due to the extra week of expenses in the current\nyear 14 week quarter. Selling general and administrative expenses were $11.8\nmillion for the year ended July 3, 2004 compared to $11.4 million for the prior\nyear. This increase was primarily due to the extra week of expenses in the\ncurrent year coupled with increased credit insurance costs associated with\nincreased sales to customers based in the Caribbean.\n\n         Interest expense was $1.2 million for the quarter ended July 3, 2004\ncompared to $1.2 million in the prior year quarter. Interest expense was $4.9\nmillion for the year ended July 3, 2004 compared to $5.3 million for the prior\nyear. At July 3, 2004, the Company's subsidiary Delta Mills, Inc. was in\ncompliance with the covenants under its revolving credit facility, as amended,\nand with the covenants of its senior notes indenture dated August 25, 1997.\nDelta Mills, Inc. has made the September 1, 2004 semi-annual interest payment\nrequired by the senior notes indenture. At July 3, 2004, the Company had unused\n\n", u'\n\navailability under its revolving credit facility of $12.6 million. Subsequent to\nJuly 3, 2004, the Company entered into further amendments to its revolving\ncredit facility pursuant to which the maximum availability was reduced to $38\nmillion and the maximum leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants\nwere replaced with a minimum EBITDA covenant. The new covenant sets required\nminimum EBITDA levels for each quarter end of fiscal 2005 and provides that it\nwill constitute an event of default if the Company and its lender fail to agree\nby the end of fiscal year 2005 to minimum EBITDA levels for the remainder of the\nterm of the revolving credit facility. This amendment would not have changed the\nunused availability under the revolving credit facility as of July 3, 2004.\n\n         The Company has recently entered into a contract to sell its Furman\nplant, which had been held for sale since fiscal year 2002. This contract has\nrequired the Company to record a fiscal 2004 year end impairment charge\nassociated with this asset of approximately $847,000.\n\n         Due to continuing challenges in the domestic marketplace coupled with\nthe uncertainties associated with the pending elimination of quotas in January\n2005, the Company is in the process of evaluating its projections for fiscal\n2005, which are necessary to determine certain impairment charge estimates and\nother assumptions for fiscal year 2004. Pending the outcome of these\nevaluations, the Company is not at this time in a position to release further\nfinancial information with respect to fiscal 2004, and will not be holding a\nconference call with respect to its fiscal year 2004 results until following the\nfiling of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2004 due October 1,\n2004. The Company believes, however, that the financial information set forth in\nthis press release is unlikely to change materially as a result of these\nevaluations.\n\n         The preceding discussion contains certain "forward-looking statements".\nThese are based on the Company\'s expectations and are necessarily dependent upon\nassumptions, estimates and data that the Company believes are reasonable and\naccurate but may be incorrect, incomplete or imprecise. Forward-looking\nstatements are also subject to a number of business risks and uncertainties, any\nof which could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in\nor implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties\ninclude, among others, changes in the retail demand for apparel products, the\ncost of raw materials, competitive conditions in the apparel and textile\nindustries, the relative strength of the United States dollar as against other\ncurrencies, changes in United States and international trade regulations,\nincluding without limitation the expected end of quotas on textile and apparel\nproducts among World Trade Organization (WTO) member states in 2005, and the\ndiscovery of unknown conditions (such as with respect to environmental matters\nand similar items). Accordingly, any forward-looking statements do not purport\nto be predictions of future events or circumstances and may not be realized.\n\n         The Company does not undertake to publicly update or revise the\nforward-looking statements even if it becomes clear that any projected results\nwill not be realized.\n\n         Delta Woodside Industries, Inc., headquartered in Greenville, South\nCarolina, manufactures and sells textile products for the apparel industry. The\nCompany, which employs approximately 1,500 people, operates five plants located\nin South Carolina.\n                                       ###\n\n\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n-----END PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE-----\n']
