(Nasdaq:\nRFMD), a leading provider of proprietary radio frequency integrated\ncircuits (RFICs) for wireless communications applications, announced\ntoday that it will host a conference call on September 21 at 9:00 a.m.\nEastern time to discuss updated financial guidance for its fiscal 2005\nsecond quarter, which ends September 30, 2004.  The call will be\nconducted by Bob Bruggeworth, president and CEO of RF Micro Devices,\nand Dean Priddy, CFO of RF Micro Devices.\n\nRF Micro Devices currently expects September 2004 quarterly revenue to\ndecline sequentially from the quarter ended June 30, 2004 by\napproximately eight to twelve percent, which equates to quarterly\nrevenue of approximately $146 million to $152.5 million.  The Company\'s\nrevised revenue expectations are due primarily to lower than\nanticipated sales to certain Asian handset customers, which the Company\nbelieves was caused by excess inventory levels in the supply chain.\nThe Company had previously forecast quarterly revenue of approximately\n$166 million in its July 20, 2004 earnings release and conference call.\n\nRF Micro Devices currently anticipates second quarter GAAP earnings per\nshare in the range of ($0.03) to ($0.05) and pro forma earnings per\nshare in the range of ($0.01) to ($0.03).  The pro forma earnings per\nshare estimates exclude approximately $3.9 million in non-cash expenses\nrelated to the Company\'s recent convertible bond redemption and the\namortization of deferred compensation and intangible assets. The\nCompany previously projected second quarter GAAP earnings per share in\nthe range of $0.01 to $0.02 and pro forma earnings per share in the\nrange of $0.03 to $0.04.\n\nThe Company currently anticipates sequential revenue growth in the\nDecember quarter, driven by all three business units-Cellular, Wireless\nConnectivity and Infrastructure.\n\nBob Bruggeworth commented, "The impact of short-term inventory\nadjustments, primarily in Asia, clearly impacted our GSM power\namplifier business in the September quarter.  During the quarter, we\nwere able to partially offset this weakness by growing our\nGSM/GPRS/EDGE market share at the world\'s two largest handset original\nequipment manufacturers (OEMs).\n\n"We are pleased with our efforts in the September quarter to grow our\nemerging businesses.  During the quarter, we executed on numerous\ninitiatives that were part of our original July 20, 2004 guidance: We\nare on track to increase our Bluetooth-Registered Trademark- business\nmore than two-hundred percent.  Additionally, we began production\nshipments of GSM/GPRS/EDGE transceivers and power amplifiers to a top-\ntier handset OEM.  We continue to forecast shipments of at least one\nmillion POLARIS-Trademark- chipsets in the December quarter, driven\nprimarily by worldwide carriers\' rapid migration to EDGE networks."\n\nA live audio webcast of the presentation will be available via the\nRFMD-Registered Trademark- Investor Relations web page at the following\nURL:\n\nhttp://ir.ccbn.com/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=RFMD&script=2100\n\nThe webcast will be available for replay until 5:00 p.m. Eastern time\non October 20, 2004.\n\nRF Micro Devices believes pro forma reporting provides useful\nsupplemental information to the investment community and facilitates a\nbetter understanding of its results of operations.
