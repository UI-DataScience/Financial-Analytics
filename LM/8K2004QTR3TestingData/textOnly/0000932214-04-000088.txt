(Nasdaq/NM:\nNUHC), a leading distributor of active and passive electronic components today\nreported financial and operating results for the second quarter and six months\nended August 31, 2004.\n\nNet sales for the quarter ended August 31, 2004 were $119.2 million compared to\n$80.0 million for the comparable period last year, an increase of 49%. Net\nincome for the quarter was $1,186,000 or $0.07 per share on 16,884,147 basic\nshares outstanding [$.07 per share on 17,663,839 diluted shares], compared to a\nnet loss of $(623,000) or $(0.04) per share on 16,681,145 basic and diluted\nshares outstanding in the same period last year.\n\nFor the six months ended August 31, 2004, net sales increased to $237.4 million\nfrom $152.8 million in the comparable period last year, an increase of 55%. Net\nincome for the first half of fiscal 2005 was $2,372,000 or $0.14 per share on\n16,884,147 basic shares outstanding [$0.13 per share on 17,875,443 diluted\nshares], compared with a net loss of $(1,454,000), or $(0.09) per share on\n16,678,093 basic and diluted shares outstanding in the year-earlier period.\n\nArthur Nadata, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Nu Horizons,\nsaid, "Sales and net income, year over year and quarter over quarter, showed\nsubstantial gains as our industry continued its recovery from the downturn\nexperienced a few years ago. While we were able to report a slight increase in\nsequential sales for the quarter ended August 31, 2004, $119.2 million as\ncompared to $118.2 million for the quarter ended May 31, 2004, in practical\nterms sales remained relatively flat after five quarters of substantial\nsequential sales increases."\n\nNadata continued, "This slowing in our sequential rate of growth appears to be\nan industry-wide phenomenon, which also coincides with the historically slower\nsales activity in the summer period. The question is whether it is a temporary\npause or a more permanent slowing of industry growth. We believe that the next\nsix to nine months will result in a more modest sequential industry growth rate\nthan was experienced over the past eighteen months."\n\n                                  (more)\n\n', u'\n\n\nNUHC Reports Second Quarter Fiscal 2005 Results                          Page 2\n\nNadata concluded, "Our gross margins appear to have stabilized and have actually\nimproved modestly over the past two quarters. We believe that our overall sales\ngrowth should continue to be positively impacted by our demand creation model\napproach which should allow us to maintain margins as well as continue to\nincrease our market share although no assurances can be given in this regard."\n\nA conference call to further discuss earnings will be held today at 4:15 pm ET.\nThe call can be accessed by dialing (800) 915 - 4836, (international, dial (973)\n317 - 5319) and refer to the Nu Horizons call.
