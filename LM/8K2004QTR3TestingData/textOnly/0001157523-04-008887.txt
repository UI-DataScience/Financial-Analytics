Fourth quarter sales increased\napproximately 27% to $187.8 million compared to $148.2 million in the\nprior year. Current year results include those from Kwikee Products\nCompany Inc. ("Kwikee") and Dresco B.V. ("Dresco"), which were\nacquired during fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of these\nacquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes on translated\nresults, fourth quarter sales increased approximately 11% from the\ncomparable prior year period. Fourth quarter fiscal 2004 net earnings\nand diluted earnings per share ("EPS") were $18.3 million and $0.75\nper diluted share, respectively, compared to fiscal 2003 fourth\nquarter net earnings and diluted earnings per share of $10.0 million\nand $0.41 per diluted share, respectively. Fourth quarter fiscal 2004\nresults include a charge of $7.1 million, net of tax, or $0.29 per\ndiluted share, arising from the tender of the Company\'s 13% Senior\nSubordinated Notes (the "13% Notes") and net income from discontinued\noperations of $10.9 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, due to the\nrelease of a reserve for tax and other obligations related to the\nspin-off of APW Ltd. in fiscal 2000 (the "Spin-off"). Excluding these\nspecial items, current year fourth quarter net earnings increased 44%\nto $0.59 per diluted share (see attached reconciliation of earnings).\n    Actuant\'s sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2004 were\n$726.9 million, approximately 24% higher than the $585.4 million\ngenerated in the prior year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and\nforeign currency rate changes, fiscal 2004 sales increased\napproximately 9% from the comparable prior year period. Net earnings\nfor the year ended August 31, 2004 were $34.8 million, or $1.41 per\ndiluted share, compared to $29.0 million, or $1.18 per diluted share,\nin fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2004, the Company recorded net of tax\nspecial charges of $25.1 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, due to\nthe early extinguishment of debt and income from discontinued\noperations of $10.9 million, net of tax, or $0.44 per diluted share,\ndue to the release of a reserve for tax and other obligations related\nto the Spin-off. In fiscal 2003, the Company recorded net of tax\nspecial charges of $1.3 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, for the\nearly extinguishment of debt and $4.2 million, or $0.18 per diluted\nshare, for litigation matters associated with businesses divested\nprior to the Spin-off. Excluding these special charges, net earnings\nand diluted earnings per share for the year ended August 31, 2004 were\n$49.0 million, or $1.99 per diluted share, over 40% higher than the\n$34.4 million, or $1.41 per diluted share in the prior year (see\nattached reconciliation of earnings).\n    Commenting on the results, Robert C. Arzbaecher, Chief Executive\nOfficer, stated, "Actuant finished fiscal 2004 strongly, as fourth\nquarter results exceeded our expectations in terms of sales, earnings,\nand cash flow. Core sales grew 11% over the prior year and excluding\nthe special items (described above), Actuant increased its\nyear-over-year earnings per share for the 13th consecutive quarter."\n    Arzbaecher continued, "Favorable economic conditions and margin\nexpansion across both segments helped drive record fourth quarter\nearnings. We also benefited from a sequential improvement in\nautomotive margins, as well as earnings contributions from both Kwikee\nand Dresco. Focus on Actuant\'s LEAD (Lean Enterprise Across\nDisciplines) Process, active working capital management, and increased\nearnings drove another quarter of strong cash flow, reducing net debt\nto approximately $188 million at year-end. Despite the $65 million\nspent on acquisitions and $30 million of premiums paid to retire 13%\nNotes in fiscal 2004, our leverage ratio (debt/EBITDA) at year-end was\nlower than at the start of the year." (EBITDA is earnings before\ninterest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and minority\ninterest).\n    He concluded, "We are pleased with fiscal 2004 results - core\nsales growth of 9%, the completion of two accretive bolt-on\nacquisitions, improving margins and strong cash flow. On a full-year\nbasis and excluding special charges in both years, the $1.99 diluted\nearnings per share in fiscal 2004 was 41% higher than a year ago, and\nwas the third straight year of EPS growth in excess of 15%. Both Tools\n& Supplies and Engineered Solutions had excellent years as we saw a\nrecovering North American economy. Looking forward to fiscal 2005, we\nare optimistic that we will be able to continue to generate earnings\ngrowth. Given improved economic conditions, the recent acquisition of\nYvel S.A. and lower borrowing costs due to the completion of the 13%\nNotes tender, we are increasing our previously announced fiscal 2005\nguidance. We now expect diluted earnings per share of $2.25-$2.35 in\n2005 on sales of $750-$775 million. First quarter sales should be in\nthe $185-$190 million range, and diluted earnings per share should be\nin the range of $0.53-$0.58 per share."\n    Fiscal 2004 fourth quarter Tools & Supplies segment sales were\n$106.3 million, approximately 15% higher than last year due primarily\nto the Dresco acquisition and foreign currency rate changes. Excluding\nDresco and the impact of foreign currency rate changes, fourth quarter\nTools & Supplies segment revenues increased 2% over the prior year.\nFourth quarter fiscal 2004 Engineered Solutions segment sales\nincreased approximately 46% to $81.5 million, compared to $55.8\nmillion in the previous year. Excluding the impact of the Kwikee\nacquisition and foreign currency rate changes, Engineered Solutions\nsales increased 26%, benefiting from growth in all three of Actuant\'s\nmain actuation markets - automotive convertible top, heavy duty truck\ncab-tilt, and recreational vehicles.\n    Actuant\'s fiscal 2004 fourth quarter operating profit increased\n27% to $24.3 million, in line with the corresponding increase in\nsales. The increases in operating profit in fiscal 2004 reflect the\nbenefit of cost reductions implemented over the past year and improved\nautomotive labor efficiencies. These improvements were partially\noffset by increased corporate expenses.\n\n    Safe Harbor Statement\n\n    Certain of the above comments represent forward-looking statements\nmade pursuant to the provisions of the Private Securities Litigation\nReform Act of 1995. Management cautions that these statements are\nbased on current estimates of future performance and are highly\ndependent upon a variety of factors, which could cause actual results\nto differ from these estimates. Actuant\'s results are also subject to\ngeneral economic conditions, variation in demand from customers, the\nimpact of geopolitical activity on the economy, continued market\nacceptance of the Company\'s new product introductions, the successful\nintegration of business unit acquisitions and related restructuring,\noperating margin risk due to competitive pricing and operating\nefficiencies, supply chain risk, material and labor cost increases,\nforeign currency fluctuations and interest rate risk. See the\nCompany\'s registration statements filed with the Securities and\nExchange Commission for further information regarding risk factors.\n\n    Actuant, headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is a diversified\nindustrial company with operations in more than 20 countries.

These items include results from discontinued\n    operations, expenses recorded to extinguish debt entered into at\n    the time of the spin-off and litigation charges related to matters\n    associated with businesses divested prior to the spin-off. These\n    measures should not be considered as an alternative to net\n    earnings or diluted earnings per share as an indicator of the\n    company\'s operating performance. However, this presentation is\n    important to investors for understanding the operating results of\n    the current portfolio of Actuant companies.\n\n(2) EBITDA represents net earnings before net financing costs, income\n    tax expense, depreciation & amortization and minority interest.\n    EBITDA excluding discontinued operations and special items is net\n    of charges or credits that are not representative of the normal\n    recurring operations of the current portfolio of Actuant\n    companies. These special items include results from discontinued\n    operations, expenses recorded to extinguish debt entered into at\n    the time of the spin-off and litigation charges related to matters\n    associated with businesses divested prior to the spin-off. EBITDA\n    is not a calculation based upon generally accepted accounting\n    principles (GAAP). The amounts included in the EBITDA calculation,\n    however, are derived from amounts included in the Consolidated\n    Statements of Earnings data. EBITDA should not be considered as an\n    alternative to net earnings or operating profit as an indicator of\n    the company\'s operating performance, or as an alternative to\n    operating cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Actuant has\n    presented EBITDA because it regularly reviews this as a measure of\n    the company\'s ability to incur and service debt. In addition,\n    EBITDA is used by many of our investors and lenders, and is\n    presented as a convenience to them. However, the EBITDA measure\n    presented may not always be comparable to similarly titled\n    measures reported by other companies due to differences in the\n    components of the calculation.\n\n(3) First quarter 2003 special items include a $2.0 million charge\n    related to the early redemption of debt and a $7.3 million charge\n    related to litigation for business units divested prior to the\n    July 31, 2000 spin-off. Third quarter 2003 special items\n    represents an $0.8 million reversal of a portion of the $7.3\n    million first quarter charge for the favorable settlement of such\n    litigation. First, third and fourth quarter 2004 special items\n    represents charges related to the early redemption of debt. Second\n    quarter 2004 special items represents the non-cash charge\n    attributable to the write-off of remaining debt issuance costs\n    associated with the senior secured credit facility that was\n    replaced during February 2004.\n\n\n    CONTACT: Actuant Corporation\n             Andrew Lampereur, 414-352-4160\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n-----END PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE-----\n']
