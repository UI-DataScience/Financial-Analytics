(Amex: OPT)\nannounced today that it has conducted a preliminary review of the classification\nof its long term debt in its previously reported financial statements for the\nyear ended December 31, 2003 and that the filing of its Form 10-Q for the\nquarter ended June 30, 2004 will be delayed pending completion of this review\nand the previously announced review of its accounting for inventory and the\nrestatement of its financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2004.\n\nThe company now believes its classification as a long term liability of\napproximately $9.7 million and approximately $1.6 million as of December 31,\n2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively, owed under its loan agreement with its\nsenior lender, should be classified as a current liability. In its Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2003, the company reported current portions of\nlong-term debt of approximately $1.1 million and approximately $1.3 million as\nof December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively, and long-term debt of\napproximately $11.5 million and approximately $2.6 million as of December 31,\n2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. The company expects current portions\nof long-term debt will be approximately $10.8 million and approximately $2.8\nmillion as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively, and long\nterm debt will be approximately $1.8 million and approximately $1.0 million as\nof December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. Accordingly, the\ncompany expects to restate its previously reported financial statements for the\nyear ended December 31, 2003 to reflect the reclassification of the debt. The\ncompany does not expect any change in the net income or loss available to common\nstockholders as originally reported for such periods as a result of the expected\nrestatement. The Company's management now believes that the amounts outstanding\npursuant to certain provisions contained in the credit facility should have been\nclassified as current liabilities rather than long-term debt, pursuant to the\nprovisions of consensus 95-22 issued by the Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard's Emerging Issues Task Force.\n\n\n", u"\n\nBased upon the review and the expected restatement, the company concluded on\nAugust 17, 2004, that the company's previously reported financial statements for\nthe year ended December 31, 2003 should no longer be relied upon pending the\nfiling of its amended Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2003 which the company expects to file with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission by September 3, 2004.\n\nThe Company has notified and discussed this matter with its independent\nregistered public accounting firm.\n\nThe company previously filed a Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission which extended the due date of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for\nthe quarter ended June 30, 2004 from August 16, 2004 to August 23, 2004. The\ncompany, however, is delaying the filing of the Form 10-Q to assess the impact\nof this restatement and the previously announced restatement of its March 31,\n2004 financial statements on the disclosure in the Form 10-Q before it is filed\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company expects to file the\nForm 10-Q as soon as practicable after completion of these restatements, which\nthe company expects to complete by September 3, 2004.\n\nThe company anticipates that in its consolidated statement of operations for the\nquarter ended June 30, 2004, it will report total net revenues for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2004 of approximately $60.3 million, down from\napproximately $63.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003. Total net\nrevenues for the three months ended June 30, 2004 is estimated at approximately\n$30.8 million, down from approximately $32.0 million for the three months ended\nJune 30, 2003. These decreases in total net revenues principally resulted from\ndecreased revenues at Wise Optical and the Buying Group and lost revenues from\nterminated contracts related to Managed Vision. Loss from continuing operations\nfor the six months ended June 30, 2004 is estimated at approximately $1million,\ndown from approximately $2.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003.\nLoss from continuing operations for the three months ended June 30, 2004 is\nestimated at approximately $0.1 million, down from approximately $2.2 million\nfor the three months ended June 30, 2003. These decreases in loss from\ncontinuing operations principally resulted from the company's efforts to improve\noperating results at Wise Optical and the resulting decrease in expenditures.\nNet loss to common stockholders for the six months ended June 30, 2004 is\nestimated at approximately $2.3 million, which is equal to the net loss to\ncommon stockholders of $2.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003. Net\nloss to common stockholders for the three months ended June 30, 2004 is\nestimated at approximately $1.1 million, down from approximately $2.3 million\nfor the three months ended June 30, 2003. These decreases in net loss to common\nstockholders principally resulted from the company's efforts to improve\noperating results at Wise Optical and the resulting decrease in expenditures.\n\nAdditionally, the company stated that on August 16, 2004, the company amended\nthe terms of its loan agreement with its senior lender. In connection with the\namendment, the company received a waiver from its senior lender for any\nnon-compliance with the minimum fixed charge ratio covenant under the loan\nagreement as of March 31, 2004, April 30, 2004, May 31, 2004 and June 30, 2004\nas a result of the restatement of its March 31, 2004 financial statements. The\namendment also amended the loan agreement with its senior lender to, among other\nthings,\n\n", u'\n\nextend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility from January 25, 2006\nto January 25, 2007, (ii) provide access to a $2.0 million temporary\nover-advance bearing interest at prime plus 5 1/2%, and in no event less than\n6%, which is to be repaid in eleven monthly installments of $100,000 commencing\non October 1, 2004 with the remaining balance to be repaid in full by August 31,\n2005, which is guaranteed by the company\'s major stockholder, Palisade\nConcentrated Equity Partnership, L.P., (iii) change the fixed charge ratio\ncovenant from 1.5 to 1 to not less than 1 and to extend the next test period for\nthis covenant to March 31, 2005, (iv) decrease the minimum tangible net worth\nfinancial covenant from $(2.0) million to $(3.0) million and (v) add a debt\nservice coverage ratio covenant of between 0.7 to 1.0 beginning October 31, 2004\nthrough February 28, 2005. In addition, the waiver and amendment increased the\ntermination fee payable if the company terminates the revolving credit facility\nby 2% and increased the yield maintenance amount payable, in lieu of the\ntermination fee, if the Company terminates the revolving credit facility\npursuant to a refinancing with another commercial financial institution, by 2%.\nThe yield maintenance amount was also changed to mean an amount equal to the\ndifference between (i) the all-in effective yield which could be earned on the\nrevolving balance through January 25, 2007 and (ii) the total interest and fees\nactually paid to its senior lender on the revolving credit facility prior to the\ntermination or repayment date. The company paid its senior lender $25,000 in\nfinancing fees in connection with this waiver and amendment.\n\nABOUT OPTICARE HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC.\n\nOptiCare Health Systems, Inc. is an integrated eye care services company focused\non vision benefits management, the distribution of products and software\nservices to eye care professionals, and consumer vision services, including\nmedical, surgical and optometric services and optical retail.\n\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements made pursuant to the\nsafe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements include, but are not limited to, the expected outcome of the\nreview, the expectation of restating the company\'s financial statements, the\nexpected impact of a restatement on the company\'s financial statements,\nincluding, but not limited to, the expectation that the restatement will not\nchange the net income or loss available to common stockholders as originally\nreported and the expected classification of the company\'s debt to its senior\nlender, the expected timing of restating the company\'s financial statements and\nfiling the Form 10-Q, the expected financial results for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2004, as well as other statements containing words such as\n"plan," "anticipate," "expect," "intend," "believe," "will," or similar\nexpressions.
