The increase was primarily\ndue to strong sales of Urea 40% Cream and Lotion, the introduction of Ofloxacin\nOphthalmic Solution in May and the recent acquisition of Naprelan(R) in June.\n\nNet sales for the Health Care Products division, which markets the Company\'s\nbranded products, were $1,450,000, an increase of $590,000 or 69%, compared to\n$860,000 reported for the same period last year. The increase was primarily\ncaused by increased sales of DiabetiDerm(R) products. Additionally, in the prior\nperiod, sales in the Health Care Products division were adversely affected by\nhigher than usual product returns.\n\nCost of sales increased to $5,925,000, 49% of net sales, for the three months\nended July 31, 2004 from $4,516,000, 49% of net sales, for the three months\nended July 31, 2003.\n\nResearch and product development costs for the three months ended July 31, 2004\nincreased to $1,088,000, or 9% of net sales compared to $563,000 or 6% of net\nsales for the same period ended July 31, 2003 primarily due to expenditures on\ndevelopment of a steroidal nasal spray. Management expects research and\ndevelopment costs to run approximately 7% to 9% of expected net sales this\nfiscal year as the Company continues to emphasize spending on the development of\nnew products.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased to $3,827,000, 32% of net\nsales, from $2,946,000, 32% of net sales, for the three months ended July 31,\n2004 and 2003. This was primarily the result of increased commission expenses\nassociated with the introduction of new products, ongoing expenses related to\nthe Tussi 12 D S litigation, initial spending on Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404\ncompliance, amortization of intangibles related to the Naprelan(R) license\nagreement and one time expenses incurred in connection with a potential\nacquisition that management decided not to pursue.\n\nNet income for the three months ended July 31, 2004 and 2003 was $869,000 and\n$953,000, respectively, a decrease of $84,000, or 9%. Fully diluted earnings per\nshare decreased to $.10 per share for the three months ended July 31, 2004 from\n$.11 for the three months ended July 31, 2003. The decrease is due to lower net\nincome for the current period and an increase in the number of shares\noutstanding primarily resulting from the private placement of the Company\'s\ncommon stock conducted in July 2003.\n\nDavid Seltzer, President and CEO, commented on the quarter: "We are pleased with\nour financial results for the first quarter. Our generic business, led by our\nUrea 40% line, remains strong. In addition our sales were positively impacted by\nthe successful introduction of our Ofloxacin Opthalmic Solution, as well as\nsales of recently acquired Naprelan(R). We are also pleased with the results of\nour Health Care Products division which showed a dramatic increase in sales\ndriven by the company\'s DiabetiDerm(R) line.\n\n"While our net income was slightly lower for the quarter, it was primarily the\nresult of increased Research and Development spending. We believe that we are\ntaking the correct steps by staying fully committed to enhancing our pipeline of\nproducts in development, as we undertake more challenging projects. Our growing\nportfolio of liquid generic products will drive our company\'s growth in the\nfuture."\n\nHi-Tech currently has seven products awaiting approval at the FDA. These\nproducts target brand sales of over $300 million. In addition to these products\nawaiting approval at the FDA, Hi-Tech has twenty products in active development\ntargeting brand sales of over $2.0 billion, including sterile ophthalmic\nproducts, oral solutions and suspensions and nasal sprays.\n\nThe Company\'s management reiterates its belief that net sales will grow between\n15% and 20% for Fiscal Year 2005. The Company\'s ability to meet the forecast\ndepends on such factors as the timing of new product launches, competition,\nlegal proceedings and other market conditions.\n\nHi-Tech is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing, manufacturing and\nmarketing branded and generic prescription and OTC products for the general\nhealthcare industry. The Company specializes in difficult to manufacture liquid\nand semi-solid dosage forms and produces a range of sterile ophthalmic, otic and\ninhalation products. The Company\'s Health Care Products Division is a leading\ndeveloper and marketer of branded prescription and OTC products for the diabetes\nmarketplace.\n\nForward-looking statements (statements which are not historical facts) in this\nrelease are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
