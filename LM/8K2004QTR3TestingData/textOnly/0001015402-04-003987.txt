On a\npositive  note, days\' sales outstanding have decreased from 133 days as of March\n31,  2004  to 110 days as of August 31, 2004.  Bad debt reserve rates applied to\ncurrent  period transports have increased only slightly as compared to June 2004\ntransports.\n\nThe  quarter-to-date  period  also  reflects  a  17.9%  increase  in maintenance\nexpenses  as  compared with the prior year two-month period, despite only a 3.1%\nincrease  in  flight  volume.  The  percentage increase not attributed to flight\nvolume  reflects  an  increase  of  approximately $1,100,000 over the prior-year\nperiod.  The  increase in expense was primarily attributed to significant engine\nand  transmission  overhaul  activity  during  the  period, combined with annual\ninflationary  adjustments  in  parts  and  overhaul  costs.\n\nAdditionally,  community-based  transports  during  the month of August were 229\nbelow  budget  expectations.  For  community bases in operation greater than one\nyear,  360  fewer  requests  for  service  were  received  as  compared with the\nprior-year  month,  partially  attributed to unfavorable weather patterns in the\nEastern States. Community-based operating bases in service greater than one year\nin  the  Northeast  and  Southeast regions averaged almost 10 fewer requests for\nservice  per  base  during  August  than in the prior-year period. The aggregate\nunfavorable  budget  variance  attributed  to  the  lower  flight  volume  was\napproximately $1,000,000 based on average net revenue after bad debt expense per\ntransport  recorded  during  the  period.\n\nAlthough  the Company has remained profitable during July and August, management\nanticipates  the  financial  results  for  the quarter to be significantly below\nbudgeted expectations.  In light of these developments, management believes that\nit  is  highly  improbable  that  the  Company  will achieve growth in its basic\nearnings  per  share  for  2004.\n\nAaron  Todd,  CEO  of  Air  Methods, stated, "We are certainly disappointed with\nthese recent developments.  While fluctuations in maintenance expenses, bad debt\nexpense,  and  flight  volume are inherent within our business, it is unusual to\nhave all three variables impact us negatively at the same time."\n\n"With  the  significant  reduction  in  days\'  sales  outstanding and relatively\nunchanged  collection  rates  subsequent  to  June 30, 2004, we are hopeful that\nfuture  adjustments  will  be  less  significant.  We  are  also encouraged that\ncommunity-based  flight volumes for the first half of September have returned to\n\n\n', u'\nbudgeted  expectations.  Effective  September  1,  2004,  the  Company  has also\nadjusted  its  pricing  structure  to  facilitate  stronger  reimbursement  per\ntransport.  While  these  changes  will  not  fully offset the factors discussed\nabove, they should position the Company for better results moving forward," said\nTodd.\n\nAir  Methods  Corporation  (www.airmethods.com)  is  a  leader  in  emergency\n                            ------------------\naeromedical  transportation,  medical  services  and technology.
