Revenues for the three months ended July 31, 2004 increased\n$15,998,000, or 22.8%, to $86,186,000, compared to $70,188,000 the same period\nlast year.\n\n"A very strong quarter as all our divisions were up at the same time," said\nAndrew B. Schmitt, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Given our mix of\nbusiness, we are benefiting from a number of positive drivers impacting natural\nresource demand and an improving economy. Normally, we would experience a few\nbumps along the way. This quarter we were hitting on all cylinders."\n\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues was 27.9% and 27.1% for the three and\nsix months ended July 31, 2004 compared to 29.1% and 29.0% for the three and six\nmonths ended July 31, 2003. The decreases in gross profit percentage were\nprimarily attributable to continued pricing pressures from municipal customers\nin the water resources division along with reduced margins associated with the\npromotion of certain new water treatment products. The decreases in the water\nresources division margins were partially offset by increased margins in the\nmineral exploration division due to increased exploration activity because of\nhigher gold and base metal prices.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $14,471,000 for the\nthree months ended July 31, 2004 and increased to $28,396,000 for the six months\nended July 31, 2004 compared to $15,124,000 and $27,623,000 for the three and\nsix months ended July 31, 2003. Excluding severance-related benefits of\n$1,244,000 accrued in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the increase for both\nthe three and six month periods was primarily related to the Company\'s expansion\nof its water treatment capabilities, increased expenses associated with the\nCompany\'s coalbed methane ("CBM") development efforts and incremental costs of\napproximately $650,000 for the implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley requirements.\n\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization increased to $3,338,000 and $6,523,000\nfor the three and six months ended July 31, 2004 compared to $2,951,000 and\n$6,011,000 for the same periods last year. The increase was primarily a result\nof increased depreciation in the mineral exploration division and depletion\nassociated with the Company\'s CBM projects.\n\nThe Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2,320,000 for the\nthree and six months ended July 31, 2003. The loss represents prepayment\npenalties and the write-off of associated deferred fees in connection with\nrefinancing of the Company\'s credit facilities in July 2003.\n\nIncome tax expense of $3,751,000 and $5,289,000 were recorded for the three and\nsix months ended July 31, 2004, compared to $663,000 and $1,527,000 for the same\nperiods last year. The debt extinguishment costs recorded in the second quarter\nof fiscal 2004 were treated as discrete period items for interim tax accounting\npurposes, which resulted in the recording of a tax benefit at the statutory tax\nrate. Exclusive of the impact of the tax treatment of the debt extinguishment\ncosts in July 2003, the effective rate was 50% for the six months ended July 31,\n2004 compared to 60.7% for the same period last year. The improvement in the\neffective rate is primarily attributable to improved earnings in international\noperations. The effective rate in excess of the statutory federal rate was a\nresult of the impact of nondeductible expenses and the tax treatment of certain\nforeign operations.\n\n\n                                       2\n', u'\n\n\nWATER RESOURCES DIVISION\n(in thousands)\n\n', u'\n', u'\n                                             Three months ended                   Six months ended\n                                                  July 31,                            July 31,\n                                          -------------------------           -----------------------\n                                            2004              2003             2004             2003\n                                          -------            ------           ------           ------\n', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u'\nRevenues                                   $47,918          $44,607          $93,201          $83,376\nIncome from continuing operations            6,299            4,807           10,330            9,510\n', u"\n\nWater resources revenues increased 7.4% to $47,918,000, and 11.8% to\n$93,201,000, for the three and six months ended July 31, 2004, respectively.

The increase for the periods was primarily the result of increased\nexploration activity in the Company's markets due to higher gold and base metal\nprices. Additionally, increases in Africa were partially the result of capacity\nfrom the purchase of DrillCorp assets late in fiscal 2004.\n\nIncome from continuing operations for the mineral exploration division was\n$3,705,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2004 and $7,227,000 for the six\nmonths ended July 31, 2004, compared to $1,213,000 and $1,003,000 for the three\nand six months ended July 31, 2003. The improved earnings in the division were\nprimarily attributable to the increased activity levels noted above and improved\nearnings by the Company's Latin American affiliates. In addition, in the prior\nyear, the Company incurred increased expenses in Australia to bring equipment\ninto compliance with changes to local transportation regulations.\n\n\n                                       3\n", u'\n\n\nGEOCONSTRUCTION DIVISION\n(in thousands)\n', u'\n', u'\n                                             Three months ended                   Six months ended\n                                                  July 31,                            July 31,\n                                          -------------------------           -----------------------\n                                            2004              2003             2004             2003\n                                          -------            ------           ------           ------\n', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u'\nRevenues                                    $10,949          $ 8,221          $17,039          $14,352\nIncome from continuing operations             1,654            1,068            1,519            1,272\n', u"\n\nGeoconstruction revenues increased 33.2% to $10,949,000 and 18.7% to $17,039,000\nfor the three and six months ended July 31, 2004 compared to $8,221,000 and\n$14,352,000 for the three and six months ended July 31, 2003.

Schmitt, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Looking\nforward from a macro standpoint, we expect to continue to benefit from natural\nresource demand, the improving financial condition of U.S. municipalities and\nstronger non-residential construction spending. More specifically, in the third\nquarter we expect to experience a slow down in mineral exploration in Africa as\nwe enter the wet season and in South America, as they are in their winter\nmonths. The water resource business should continue to recover while\nGeoconstruction\'s backlog is steadily increasing. On the Energy side, we expect\nCBM production will continue to grow and gas prices remain very attractive. With\nmineral exploration now making a positive contribution, the balance we derive\nfrom the industries in which we participate becomes a positive factor again for\nthe Company."\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of\nSection 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of\n1934.
