Ed?', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Ed Caudill', u'\n- - Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. - President and CEO', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Thank you, Kathy. Welcome, and thanks for\njoining us today. First quarter was a success on many levels. We showed strong\nresults, made solid improvements on all fronts, and we have good reason to be\nexcited about our future. While there is still progress to be made, a number of\nour accomplishments are worth noting. We turned solidly profitable. Fleetwood\nearned almost $7 million at the bottom line, more than 2\xbd times what we earned\n1 year ago, and we continue to grow. For the second consecutive quarter, each\nof our operating segments saw double-digit revenue growth over the prior year.\nIn fact, both divisions of our Housing Group had increased sales of over 15%,\ndespite participating in an industry that had seen a year-over-year decline\nthus far in calendar 2004.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'3', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u" SEQ.=1,FOLIO='3',FILE='C:\\jms\\mbaird\\04-10462-1\\task184144\\10462-1-mm.htm',USER='mbaird',CD='Sep 13 16:00 2004' ", u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Growth in \x96 of demand\nat our manufactured housing business led us to reopen plants at Alma, Georgia\nand Waco, Texas, which has also given us much-needed capacity to provide\nemergency and replacement housing in Florida. Our motor home division had\nanother excellent quarter. We opened new state-of-the-art facilities at\nPaxinos, Pennsylvania and Riverside, California, motor home plants since our\nlast conference call. This enables us to apply full-body paint to any of our\nmotor homes, which our customers have demonstrated that they want. And our\nbalance sheet is substantially strengthened. The last of our 9\xbd% convertible\ntrust preferred securities were eliminated during the quarter, and so we\x92ve\ntaken a total of $17.9 million in annual interest expense out of our income\nstatement. Our Housing Group has performed well throughout this 4-year downturn\nin the manufactured housing industry. Our production process has been solid.\nFrom early on, management has done an excellent job in staying ahead of the\ndowntown by managing inventory and reducing capacity levels. The fact that we\ngained 1.8 points of wholesale market share since the beginning of the year, in\na still difficult environment, can be attributed to our leadership\x92s new\nproduct development and the strong performance of our sales team in maintaining\nour distribution network. Our relationship with national community developers,\nparticularly Affordable Residential Communities, or ARC, accounts for some of\nthis year-over-year sales improvement. We believe the efforts we have made to\nkeep a steady number of dealers in strategic geographic areas and our vertical\nintegration strategy, give the Housing Group a strong competitive advantage in\ngroup profitability last quarter.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'On the RV side of our\nbusiness, our motor home division continues to lead the Company in a variety of\nways, most notably in profitability. The positive acceptance from both dealers\nand consumers of our Class A motor home products was reflected in wholesale\nsales and higher production rates of 23% year-over-year, resulting in\nsignificantly improved earnings. We have continued development of superior\nproducts and this has resulted in increased market penetration, especially in\nthe growing consumer subset of younger buyers. Our new paint facilities are\nworld-class automotive grade, and we believe the full-body-paint capability\nwill give us a compelling and competitive advantage. We just introduced our new\nSouthwind and Pace Arrow with full body paint at the Oregon FMCA show with\nexcellent consumer acceptance. Although profitable, we were disappointed with\nthe performance of our travel trailer division, even though progress has been\nmade in a number of key areas. The most important factor among all the changes\nthat we have made in this division is that our newest products have been\ndesigned for better manufacturability, and cost reduced while not compromising\ncustomer features and values. For example, the number of cabinet doors has been\nstandardized where possible. And labor that did not contribute to appearance or\nvalue has been reduced. Our new design and engineering team excels in producing\na product of higher customer acceptance, yet efficiently manufactured. These\nproducts will also be price pointed for the market segments at which they are\nfocused. This has been another of the issues with which the division has been\nwrestling.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'We are introducing\nthese products to a broad audience over the coming months. Recently, we had a\nnumber of dealers in for a product review, and their enthusiasm was strong.\nTheir reactions lead to us believe that we will rebuild our market share in\nseveral travel trailer categories before calendar 2004 ends. We also expect\nthat the division\x92s financial performance will steadily improve over the coming\nquarters because of the product development and cost reductions implemented.\nThe other part of our total product line, Fleetwood Folding Trailers, has also\nundergone some changes. In the face of a market that was in overall decline and\nwith continuing profit losses, we clearly saw we needed to take vigorous\naction. Following the end of the quarter, therefore, we rationalized folding\ntrailers to better align with our travel trailer division, changing some\nreporting relationships and driving millions of dollars of hard costs out of\nthe business.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'From a longer-term\nperspective, we continue to believe the outlook is extremely positive for\nFleetwood RV and the RV industry. Economic factors have improved since last\nyear at this time, and consumer demand remains high, well ahead of last year\x92s\nfigures. Interest rates continue to remain relatively low versus historic\nrates, and the baby boomers continue to enter the market and adopt the RV\nlifestyle. Now I\x92ll turn it over to Boyd to talk about some of the specifics of\nour financial results. Then I\x92ll conclude with our outlook for fiscal 2005.\nBoyd?', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Boyd Plowman\xa0\n- - ', u'Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. - EVP\nand CFO', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Thanks, Ed. We achieved a 12.6%, or an almost\n$82 million increase in total revenues, $727.8 million, versus last year\x92s\nfirst quarter of 646.1 million. Operating income of $16.2 million represented\nan increase of $2.8 million, or 21%, over last year. And our net income of $6.7\nmillion, or 12 cents per share, compared to last year\x92s $1.9 million, or 5\ncents per share. Major factors that led to the improvement in our quarterly\nresults over the prior year include the following: overall gross margin was up\nfrom 18.1% to 18.8%, mostly due to motor home improvement. The motor home\ndivision had a 24% increase in sales and a 40% improvement in income from\noperations, $16.9 million, compared to $12 million in last year\x92s first quarter.\nMotor home gross margins also improved from 13.9% to 15.7%.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'The Housing Group\nearned $400,000 in the quarter, a significant turn around from a $6 million\nloss in the first quarter of last year, mostly due to a 13% increase in sales.\nOur wholesale operations earned $6.1 million, more than triple last year\x92s\noperating income of 1.9 million. The higher earnings were driven by a 15%\nincrease in sales, which resulted in capacity utilization of 66%, versus 58%\nlast year. The housing retail loss decreased from 8\xbd million to $6 million,\nprimarily due to a 16% increase in revenue. On the other hand, our\nyear-over-year results were ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'4', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u" SEQ.=1,FOLIO='4',FILE='C:\\jms\\mbaird\\04-10462-1\\task184144\\10462-1-mm.htm',USER='mbaird',CD='Sep 13 16:00 2004' ", u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'negatively affected by\nthe decline in profitability in travel trailers and the increased loss of\nfolding trailers, both of which were primarily due to lower sales and a decline\nin gross margins.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Balance sheet changes\nof note since our fiscal year end include the following: Cash and investment\nbalances are down by $64 million. Cash was used to build inventories, decrease\naccounts payable, and to redeem or convert the remaining 9\xbd% convertible trust\npreferred securities. Receivables increased by $18.3 million, mostly due to the\nhigh volume of RV sales that were generated near the end of the quarter. We\npaid out cash of $22.2 million to redeem or convert the trust preferred\nsecurities. Long-term liabilities decreased by more than $55 million during the\nquarter, due to the conversion and redemption of the remaining 9\xbd% convertible\ntrust preferred securities, net of the effect of a new capital lease. The\nconversion, combined with net income for the quarter, also resulted in a $41.8\nmillion increase in shareholders\x92 equity. And now, I\x92ll turn it back over to\nEd.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Ed Caudill ', u'\xa0- Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. - President and\nCEO', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Thanks, Boyd. I spoke\nearlier about what Fleetwood is doing in each of our primary operating\ndivisions. We are affected, as well, by industry trends in both businesses.\nFortunately, we believe that overall, these trends point to improvements in\neach. The dollar volume in recreational vehicle sales is headed towards a new\n25-year high in calendar 2004, and the road signs are excellent for the next\ndecade, as baby boomers move into the prime RV buying years. Several key data\npoints for manufactured housing are also positive, such as the number of\nlenders and the level of repossessions. Additionally, the damage caused by\nhurricanes Charley and Frances has generated some short-term demand for\nmanufactured housing products. Longer term, the demand for affordable housing\nis expected to grow, due to increased immigration and an increased rate of\npeople reaching retirement age. For the 6 months ended June 30th, 2004,\nindustry shipments were down only slightly compared to the prior year, so we\nbelieve that the industry has stabilized, even though the improvements that we\nexpect to see are not apparent as of yet.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'We remain confident\nthat an upturn will be evident before the end of the calendar year. We\x92re\noptimistic about the future of both of our businesses and our own growth within\nthese industries. For fiscal 2005, we expect to achieve improved profitability\nin the RV Group and the wholesale division of the Housing Group, although we\nstill expect to incur an operating loss at our retail division. Primarily\nbecause of the continued strength in our RV business, we expect to be\nprofitable for the second quarter, with a substantial improvement over last\nyear\x92s results, and we expect to be significantly profitable for the full\nfiscal year. That concludes our general remarks about operating results.\nOperator, please open up the line for questions.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'QUESTION AND ANSWER', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Operator', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Certainly.

I\x92ve been on board at Fleetwood, now, for about a little over a year.\nI can tell you, Bill, we have 25 initiatives year-over-year, in terms of what I\ncall the change process at FRC. As I reported last quarter, I\x92m very confident\nthat we\x92re on the right track. It is disappointing that negative earnings\ncontinue to be yielded, but let me quote a couple of statistics. Revenue was up\n16% over quarter-over-quarter, sales were up. We have a new management team\nthat has replaced an incredible number of folks throughout the organization.\nAnd that will take a bit of time with training to get the productivity required\nthere. But I can assure you that all eyes are trained on the change process.\nWe\x92re making progress. I\x92d be reluctant to speculate when profitability is\ngoing to return, but I can tell you it\x92s high on my priority list.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Bill Gibson\xa0\n- - ', u'Nollenberger Capital - Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Okay. Yeah. Because, just as an outside\nlooking in, I mean, that swing there is significant if \x96 once that occurs. On a\ndifferent industry, on travel trailers, that\x92s been another frustratingly long\nturnaround. Was that a case when you did a lot of new models a year or so ago,\nthat they just weren\x92t designed to be manufactured easier or when you made that\ncomment, is that of the latest generation or\xa0\x96\xa0?', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Chris Braun\xa0\n- - ', u'Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. - SVP -\nRV Group', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Yeah. Bill, this is\nChris. I can answer that. That\x92s pretty accurate what you stated, is we came\nout with a full new product line, and first of all, we hit our plants with too\nmany new products all at one time. We\x92ve now changed our approach there, and we\nintroduce products over the course of the year. And the products that we\nintroduced, they were well received, but they were very complex and difficult\nto build. As Ed alluded to, we\x92ve taken steps to reduce a lot of that\ncomplexity, and we will continue to take steps in that direction, putting out a\nhigh quality product that is just designed more for manufacture and ease of\nassembly, thus improving our labor efficiencies.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Bill Gibson\xa0\n- - ', u'Nollenberger Capital - Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Good.

On the RV side, we saw from our dealers and from some federal\nentities, as a request for a little over 700 additional trailers, but that\x92s really\nbeen the impact.

I have a question on the travel trailer and folding trailer\ndivisions. You made a comment about consolidations after the end of your\nquarter in the folding trailer division. First question is, if you stayed in\nthat business, what would be the annualized cost savings and why did you wait\nso long to do this?', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Ed Caudill ', u'\xa0- Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. - President and\nCEO', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0I\x92ll take part of it and I\x92ll turn the rest\nof it over to Chris. First, as you know, Barry, we\x92ve been in litigation with\nColeman over the last several quarters related to the use of the Coleman name.\nAnd that caused a lot of focus and difficulty and consideration around that\nbusiness, and forced us to be left in a position of not doing a whole lot\ndifferent with the business than we\x92ve done in the past. So that\x92s the primary\nreason we hadn\x92t taken some more significant action. Most recently, that thing\nseems to be winding down. And we decided to go ahead and more \x96 those two\nbusinesses should have been more closely related than they\x92ve been in the past.\nThey\x92ve been managed separately. And we looked at the cost of retaining that\nversus the market, especially for folding trailers, which has been in a\ncouple-year decline, and decided that we could do some things to better align\nthe two businesses and to, you know, share some different management and things\nlike that. I\x92ll let Chris talk, specifically.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'16', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u" SEQ.=1,FOLIO='16',FILE='C:\\jms\\mbaird\\04-10462-1\\task184144\\10462-1-mm.htm',USER='mbaird',CD='Sep 13 16:00 2004' ", u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Chris Braun ', u'\xa0- Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. - SVP - RV\nGroup', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Yeah, we\x92ve really\nstarted looking at in this August, so we haven\x92t completed the process by any\nstretch of the imagination to be able to comment on what the annualized cost\nsavings impact would be. But just to give you a feel, we are looking at it both\nfrom operating level in where we produce the product and how many facilities we\nneed to do that, as well as we are looking at from a sales standpoint and a\nsystems operating standpoint. As Ed mentioned, that whole folding trailer\nbusiness had been operated separate from our travel trailer and motor home\nfacilities, and we are going to break that down and just have it operate as one\nof our travel trailer plants would operate today. So there\x92s significant\nsavings there to be had.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Barry Vogel ', u'\xa0- Barry Vogel & Associates - Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Can you give us any\nidea what the savings are on an annualized basis?', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Chris Braun ', u'\xa0- Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. - SVP - RV\nGroup', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'It\x92s still too early\nto comment on that.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Barry Vogel ', u'\xa0- Barry Vogel & Associates - Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'All right. The second\nquestion is in regards to the travel trailer \x96 oh, on the folding trailers let\nme ask you this question: it\x92s an insignificant amount of revenues, a lot of\nyour competitors, your major competitors are not in that business, so why stay\nin the folding trailer business?', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Chris Braun ', u'\xa0- Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. - SVP - RV\nGroup', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'We \x96 one of the\nadvantages Fleetwood has today is that we are a full-line manufacturer. We\nbuild everything from a folding trailer on up through Class A diesel motor\nhomes. That\x92s very attractive to our dealers. They like to have the entry-level\ntype product to bring in that entry-level customer and then graduate them on up\nthrough higher products. So that\x92s probably first and foremost the reason that\nwe will stay in that business.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Barry Vogel ', u'\xa0- Barry Vogel & Associates - Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Well, the largest company in the business,\nThor Industries, doesn\x92t have a folding trailer business, and they do very\nwell.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Chris Braun ', u'\xa0- Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. - SVP - RV\nGroup', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'I think it\x92s just a\ntotally different approach in philosophy to how they\x92re approaching their\nbusiness and how we are approaching ours and what we are strategizing to\naccomplish over the next several years.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Barry Vogel ', u'\xa0- Barry Vogel & Associates - Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Okay. Now as far as travel trailers, it\x92s\nbeen very disappointing as far as results. Particularly in light of the very\nstrong market conditions and the recovery. And I know you\x92ve had some\nmanagement changes. Can you tell us how confident you are right now that you\x92re\nreally going to turn the profitability of the travel trailer business around\nsoon? If not, can you tell us, you know, why this will not happen?', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Chris Braun ', u'\xa0- Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. - SVP - RV\nGroup', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Two things on the travel trailer side of the\nhouse. We talked about products earlier, and, yeah, we buried our plants, oh,\nback a little bit over a year ago with new products. And we now, just now, have\nnew products that\x92ll be hitting the market starting \x96 actually started in\nAugust, and will continue on through November, you\x92re going to start to see a\nlot of new travel trailer product that we are introducing. That\x92s going to help\nus significantly, but also, as we mentioned earlier, we\x92ve got significant cost\nreduction efforts that we are taking on the travel trailer side of the house.\nAnd the bulk of those cost reductions will start to hit in the next two\nquarters here. So we\x92re confident that you\x92re going to continue to see improved\nresults on the travel trailer side of the business.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Barry Vogel ', u'\xa0- Barry Vogel & Associates - Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0Okay.

In terms of mix, we did see single-section business\nincrease a bit, and that was primarily attributed to our community business.\nAnd as has been indicated in the past, we actually enjoy that business, we find\nit favorable to our production schedule and making money there. You talk about\nmarket share gain, when we look over the last year-over-year period, our\ndouble-wide business is up significantly. And as a direct result of that, or I\nwould attribute that to we\x92ve won several design initiatives through MHI. We\nhave increased our dealer body representation.

The other it\x92s done, we stayed really close to what was\nhappening to material cost, and we were not afraid to test the market to make\nsure that we stayed out in front of those costs, and so part of the reason you\nsaw our margins strengthen, is that we didn\x92t let those things, get, you know,\nfar out of hand before we were taking action with both price increases and with\nmaterial surcharges. And we\x92ve continued to watch that as lumber, especially,\nhas gotten very pricey again.
