SANFILIPPO ANNOUNCES RECORD NET SALES AND NET INCOME FOR\n                                FISCAL 2004\n\nFiscal 2004 Net Income Increases 51% over the Prior Year\'s Record Net Income\n\n           Fiscal 2004 Net Sales Increase 24% over the Prior Year\n\n\nElk Grove Village, IL, August 19, 2004 -- John B. Sanfilippo & Son, Inc.\n(Nasdaq: JBSS) today announced operating results for its fiscal 2004\nfourth quarter and year ended June 24, 2004.  Net income for the current\nfourth quarter was approximately $3.5 million and was relatively\nunchanged when compared to net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal\n2003. Diluted earnings per share for the current quarter decreased to\n$.33 from $.37 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The decrease in\ndiluted earnings per share was attributable to an increase in share\ncount from the Company\'s public offering of 1.15 million common shares,\nwhich was completed at the beginning of the current quarter.  The\ncurrent quarter earnings included prepayment penalties of approximately\n$1.0 million resulting from the early extinguishment of long-term debt.\nAdditionally, after reviewing estimates of unpaid claims provided to the\nCompany by its workers\' compensation insurance carrier during the fourth\nquarter, the Company increased its workers\' compensation insurance\nreserve. The prepayment penalties and the increase in the workers\'\ncompensation reserve combined to reduce the diluted quarterly earnings\nper share by approximately $0.11.   Fiscal 2004 net income increased by\napproximately 51% to approximately $22.6 million, or $2.32 per share\ndiluted, from approximately $15.0 million, or $1.61 per share diluted,\nfor fiscal 2003.  The prepayment penalties and the increase in the\nworkers\' compensation reserve combined to reduce the diluted year end\nearnings per share by approximately $0.12.\n\nNet sales for the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter increased by approximately\n25% to approximately $124.5 million from approximately $99.3 million in\nthe fiscal 2003 fourth quarter.   Net sales for fiscal 2004 increased by\nmore than $101 million to approximately $520.8 million from net sales of\napproximately $419.7 for fiscal 2003.  The addition of new customers,\nincreased sales at existing customers and higher selling prices\neffectuated the increase in net sales in both the fourth quarter\nand the fiscal year. Net sales for both the current quarter and the\ncurrent fiscal year increased significantly in all of the Company\'s\ndistribution channels and across all nut types.  Unit volume, as\nmeasured in pounds sold, increased by 7% for the fourth quarter of\nfiscal 2004 versus the prior year\'s fourth quarter and by 13% for fiscal\n2004 versus the prior fiscal year.\n\nGross profit margin declined from 17.2% of net sales for the fourth\nquarter of fiscal 2003 to 15.3% of net sales for the current quarter due\nto significantly higher commodity costs in all of the nuts that the\nCompany processes and the increase in the workers\' compensation reserve\ndiscussed above. As a percentage of net sales, the 1.9% decline in the\nfourth quarter comparison of gross margins was substantially lower than\nthe 3.5%  decline in the third quarter comparison of gross margins due\nto selling price increases that became effective in the current fourth\nquarter.   The gross profit margin for fiscal 2004 increased to 17.6% of\nnet sales from 17.4% of net sales for fiscal 2003.  As a percentage of\nnet sales, increases in gross margin realized in the first half of\nfiscal 2004, which resulted from higher unit volume and lower peanut\ncosts, were mostly offset by declines in gross margin in the second half\nof fiscal 2004 due to significantly higher commodity costs.\n\nSelling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, fell\nto 9.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 from 10.3% in the fiscal\n2003 fourth quarter.  For fiscal 2004, selling and administrative\nexpenses, as a percentage of net sales, fell to 9.8% from 10.5% in\nfiscal 2003.  The decreases in total selling and administrative\nexpenses, as a percentage of net sales, for both the quarter and the\nfiscal year were primarily the result of increased sales while certain\nselling and administrative expenses remained relatively fixed.\nOperating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 increased to\napproximately $7.2 million from approximately $6.9 million for the\nfourth quarter of the prior year.   Operating income for fiscal 2004\nrose 42% to approximately $41.1 million from approximately $28.8 million\nfor fiscal 2003.\n\nInterest expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was approximately\n$0.6 million in comparison to approximately $1.2 million in the fourth\nquarter of 2003.  For the entire fiscal year, interest expense declined\nfrom $4.7 million to $3.4 million.  The decrease in interest expense\noccurred because the Company used the proceeds generated from its public\nequity offering, which was completed early in the current quarter, to\npay down most of its long-term and short-term debt.   Additionally, the\nCompany generated approximately $11.5 million of cash flow after capital\nexpenditures during the current fiscal year which was used to pay down\nshort-term debt.  Total debt at the end of fiscal 2004 declined to $19.2\nmillion from $70.1 million in total debt at the end of fiscal 2003.\n\nThe Company is currently studying a succession plan for the retirement\nof the Chief Executive Officer and President which may include\nconsulting arrangements and other post-employment compensation\narrangements.  It did not implement a retirement plan for those officers\nin the fourth quarter.\n\n"For the fifth consecutive year, the Company has reported record\nearnings," stated Jasper B. Sanfilippo, Chairman of the Board and Chief\nExecutive Officer.  "This year\'s earnings performance was fueled by\nremarkable increases in sales across all of the Company\'s distribution\nchannels and nut types.  Increasing consumer awareness of the health\nbenefits of eating nuts, the addition of new customers and higher\naverage selling prices led to this impressive growth," Mr. Sanfilippo\nemphasized.  "Nut markets have risen dramatically in recent months, and\nwe expect them to continue to rise in the near future as world-wide nut\nconsumption continues to increase.  These increases in the costs of our\nraw materials have had a negative impact on our gross margins in the latter\nhalf of fiscal 2004," Mr. Sanfilippo explained.  We have successfully\nimplemented price increases in the spring and also earlier this month in\nall distribution channels except our industrial channel where sales are\ntypically made pursuant to twelve-month fixed-price contracts.  Those\ncontracts will expire throughout the fall of this calendar year.  The\ncombination of the expiration of our industrial sales contracts and the\nimplementation of the August price increases should serve to stabilize our\ngross margins in the first half of fiscal 2005, barring any further material\nincreases in nut costs," cautioned Mr. Sanfilippo.  "Though we have seen our\nworkers\' compensation costs increase recently as a result of our growth,\nwe have responded to this trend by aggressively focusing on work place\nsafety.  This increased focus on safety, which started at the end of\nfiscal 2003, is beginning to deliver positive results as the number of\nwork place accidents in the first half of calendar 2004 has declined by\napproximately 16% versus the same period last year, while the number of\nemployees has increased,"   Mr. Sanfilippo added.  "The remarkable sales\nand earnings growth in fiscal 2004 is the product of hard work on the\npart of our employees and the commitment to invest in our business to\nmeet the needs of our customers.    Though the second half of the fiscal\nyear has been challenging from a commodity standpoint, our sales growth\ndid deliver higher gross profit dollars in the fourth quarter, and our\nbeing vertically integrated in the major domestic nuts provided us with\nthe means to confront this challenge," concluded Mr. Sanfilippo.\n\n\nThe statement of Jasper B. Sanfilippo in this release is forward-\nlooking.  This forward-looking statement is based on the Company\'s\ncurrent expectations and involves risks and uncertainties.\nConsequently, the Company\'s actual results could differ materially.\nAmong the factors that could cause results to differ materially from\ncurrent expectations are:  (i) sales activity for the Company\'s\nproducts; (ii) changes in the availability and costs of raw materials\nfor the production of the Company\'s products; (iii) fluctuations in the\nvalue of the Company\'s inventories of pecans, walnuts, almonds, peanuts\nor other nuts due to fluctuations in the market prices of these nuts;\n(iv) the Company\'s ability to lessen the negative impact of competitive\npressures by reducing its selling prices and increasing sales volume\nwhile at the same time maintaining profit margins by reducing costs; (v)\nthe outcome of a pending governmental antitrust investigation of a\nportion of the peanut shelling industry; and (vi) the timing and\noccurrence (or nonoccurrence) of other transactions and events which may\nbe subject to circumstances beyond the Company\'s control.\n\nJohn B.
