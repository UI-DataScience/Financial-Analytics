Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we discuss\nour second quarter fiscal 2004 financial results. With me today are Sonus\'\nChairman and CEO, Hassan Ahmed and President and COO, Bert Notini. Brad Miller,\nSonus\' Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, is also joining us on the call\ntoday.\n\nThe press release announcing our second quarter financials was issued Friday,\nAugust 20th after the market closed on Business Wire and on First Call. The text\nof this release also appears on our Web site at www.sonusnet.com.\n\nBefore Hassan offers his opening remarks, I would like to remind you that during\nthis call, we will make projections or forward-looking statements regarding\nitems such as future market opportunities and the company\'s financial\nperformance. These projections or statements are just predictions and involve\nrisks and uncertainties such that actual events or financial results may differ\nmaterially from those we have forecasted. As a result, we can make no assurances\nthat any projections of future events or financial performance will be achieved.\nFor a discussion of important risk factors that could cause actual events or\nfinancial results to vary from these forward-looking statements, please refer to\nthe "Risk Factors" section of our annual report on Form 10-K/A dated July 28,\n2004 and the "Cautionary Statements" section of our quarterly report on Form\n10-Q dated August 20th 2004.\n\nAny forward-looking statements represent our views only as of today and should\nnot be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. While we\nmay elect to update forward-looking statements at some point, we specifically\ndisclaim any obligation to do so.\n\nIn addition, because we were unable to give several days notice of this call,\nthe statements that we make on this call may not be considered valid public\ndisclosure for purposes of Regulation FD.\n\nTo address this, we have filed a Form 8-K with the SEC containing our script for\nthis call. However, because it was obviously impossible for us to include in\nthat script the responses to questions asked on this call, our responses to\nquestions must be limited to the information covered in our prepared remarks.\nPlease bear that in mind if we are unable to address certain questions you may\nwish to ask on this call.\n\nI would now like to turn the call over to Hassan.\n\n                                       1\n', u"\n\nHassan Ahmed, chairman and chief executive officer:\n\nThanks Jocelyn. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. I am pleased\nthat on Friday Sonus reported its second quarter financial results and has filed\nits Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2004. With this filing Sonus is now\ncurrent on its financial reporting requirements with both the SEC and Nasdaq. We\nare also pleased that Friday's filing returns us to a normal reporting and\nfiling cycle and we are moving beyond what has been a difficult phase in our\nhistory.\n\nAs you know, when Nasdaq denied our request for an extension to complete our\nsecond quarter 10-Q filing, they afforded us the opportunity to re-list on the\nNasdaq under the continued listing requirements rather than the more stringent\ninitial listing standards. We have already submitted our paperwork for\nre-listing on the Nasdaq National Market.\n\nAnd, while it could have been easy to lose momentum or become distracted during\nthis period, I am very pleased with the focus and dedication that the Sonus team\nhas demonstrated in continuing to build our business and expand our presence.\nThe strong second quarter results that we reported Friday are a testament to the\nteam's performance.\n\nI'll start today by first reviewing Sonus' financial results for the second\nquarter and highlighting some of the factors that have driven our business\nduring the first half of 2004. Then we'll look at the market overall and some of\nthe recent events in our industry that are catalyzing the adoption of packet\ntelephony by carriers worldwide. Bert will then review our financial results in\nmore detail. Following that, we'll open the call up to questions.\n\nNow let's look at the quarter. We made important progress in our business during\nthe second quarter. Our revenues grew 16% sequentially to $42.4 million and our\ntotal deferred revenue balance remained strong at $93.0 million. We are pleased\nthat Sonus' profits also grew on a GAAP basis to $4.9 million or $0.02 per\nshare. Additionally, our balance sheet continues to be very strong with over\n$303 million in cash and marketable securities at the end of the second quarter.\n\nOur growth has been driven by an increasingly diversified customer base, with\nnew customers selecting Sonus and existing customers expanding their\ndeployments. Qwest Communications, AT&T Wireless and Volo Communications each\nrepresented at least 10% of our revenues in the second quarter.\n\nQwest Communications continues to be an important contributor to Sonus'\nbusiness. Qwest began building their voice over IP trunking network with Sonus\nover three years ago. Since that time, Qwest has successfully expanded this\nnetwork to support the increase in their long-distance traffic related to 271\nrelief. Building on that success, we were very pleased that Qwest announced in\nthe second quarter that they are moving into the access market and selected\nSonus to enable them to deliver VoIP business access services.\n\n                                       2\n", u"\n\nGlobal Crossing, another of our existing customers, also continued to expand\ntheir large-scale deployment with Sonus. They achieved several significant\nmilestones in the second quarter. First, they announced that they were\ndecommissioning a core circuit switch in favor of voice over IP and they plan to\ntake additional TDM switches out of service in 2004 and 2005. Additionally, the\ntraffic volumes on Global Crossing's Sonus-based network have been growing\nsteadily. In May, Global Crossing reported that minutes of use on their voice\nover IP network had more than doubled between January 2003 and March 2004. As a\ntestament to the reliability of our solutions, Global Crossing also reported\nthat they recorded 99.999 percent uptime for 2003 and year-to-date 2004 on the\nSonus network.\n\nAlso during the second quarter, Sonus announced that Volo Communications is\nimplementing Sonus' voice over IP infrastructure solutions to enhance their\nnationwide MPLS-based IP backbone.\n\nOur Q2 revenues also reflect the growing diversity of our solutions. Last\nquarter, we were pleased to announce that our SMARRT Wireless solutions are\nbeing deployed by one of the largest wireless operators in the United States,\nAT&T Wireless. AT&T Wireless is deploying packet voice in the core of their\nnationwide network to reduce costs associated with carrying their long-distance\ntraffic and interconnecting MSCs. AT&T Wireless was again a 10% customer in Q2.\n\nWhile below the 10% threshold, we are also very pleased that AT&T was once again\nan important contributor to Sonus' business during the second quarter as AT&T\ncontinued its roll-out of its AT&T CallVantage Service, one of the industry's\nleading Voice over IP offerings. Supported by Sonus, AT&T CallVantage Service\ncan now serve customers in 170 markets in the U.S. and is currently being\ntrialed in several countries around the globe.\n\nWe are very excited that Sonus now has several announced customers including\nNTT, Qwest and AT&T, that are deploying our solutions for access, or what is\nmore conventionally referred to as Class 5, services. We are pleased to have\nbeen selected by some of the largest carriers in the world to support their\naccess networks, and expect our access solutions to be a growing portion of our\nrevenues over time. Sonus formally introduced its voice over broadband solution,\nthe centerpiece of our access strategy, at SUPERCOMM in June. Featuring the ASX\nAccess Server, our Insignus softswitch delivers local area calling features as\nwell as advanced IP-based functionality over broadband technologies, including\nDSL and cable. Broadband is truly a disruptive technology that is reshaping the\ncompetitive dynamics of the telecommunications market. For carriers, it enables\nthem to expand their service offerings to include bundled voice, data and\nmultimedia services, without owning the last mile. For consumers, it provides\ncost-effective, innovative voice services over their broadband connections,\nusing their existing telephones.\n\n                                       3\n", u"\n\nOn the product front, Sonus continues to lead the market and is dedicated to\nextending this position. Sonus has been focused on delivering carrier-grade\nvoice over IP solutions for the last seven years. During that time, we have\nextended our solutions from the trunking market into the access and wireless\nmarkets. Our development efforts are focused on continuing to expand these\nofferings, adding new services and features, increasing our signaling\ncapabilities to address additional international markets and, of course,\ncontinuing to build on the industry-leading scalability and reliability of our\nsolutions. As an example of our continual development, in addition to announcing\nour voice over broadband strategy at SUPERCOMM, Sonus also announced that the\nASX now supports voice services on WiFi telephones.\n\nWe continue to add to our competitive advantage and extend our market position.\nSonus' core voice solutions being delivered today are robust and field-proven,\nincorporating more than 5 years of production experience in some of the world's\nlargest networks. We are leveraging our technology to rapidly expand into the\naccess and wireless markets. Our technology, experience and customer\nrelationships distinguish Sonus from those whose solutions are based on legacy\ntechnology or have yet to be deployed in a scale production network. Our\ntechnology lead gives us a central position in the market that we are excited to\nextend.\n\nThe important progress we made during the first half of 2004 occurred while the\ncompany was undergoing a very demanding and detailed review of its historical\nfinancial statements and I am extremely pleased that the Sonus team remained\nfocused on building its position in the market during this critical period. As\ntestament to our leadership position, independent industry analysts recognized\nSonus as the market leader in several segments of the carrier voice over IP\nequipment market for the first quarter of 2004.\n\nLet's turn now to the market overall. The voice over IP market is evolving\nrapidly. We are at an important point in the development of the market, as the\nactivity level among carriers has increased over the past year. These carriers\nare being driven by important developments in the industry that will continue to\nhave a profound effect on the overall telecommunications market.\n\nNever before has broadband been as widely accessible as it is today. More than\n21% of the households in the United States now have access to broadband and this\nrate is higher still in many geographies outside the US. This, combined with\nchanges in the regulatory environment, is intensifying service providers' focus\non voice over IP solutions. Unlike the major voice technology shifts in the\npast, the shift to a packet voice architecture is truly transformational and has\nthe potential to completely redefine the industry.\n\nIt is clear that the competitive battle among the service providers has moved to\na new level. During the first half of 2004, we have already seen announcements\nfrom the largest carriers outlining their voice over IP services for both\nbusinesses and consumers. Now many of the incumbent carriers are deploying voice\nover IP solutions in their long-distance networks and are beginning to deliver\nvoice over IP services on their local networks. These carriers are leveraging\ntheir existing data networks to fend off the competitive carriers and cable\noperators with bundled packages that include voice, video and data.\n\n                                       4\n", u"\n\nAdditionally, with the recent rulings by government regulators, the competitive\ncarriers, MSOs and IXCs are redefining their strategies for delivering telephony\nservices to consumers. Our deployment with AT&T is an important example of how\nthese carriers can capitalize on their existing data networks with the addition\nof voice over IP solutions.\n\nBut this shift isn't occurring in the United States alone. Some regions in Asia\nhave broadband penetration rates that are meaningfully higher than in the U.S.\nThese were the first regions to implement voice over broadband and service\nproviders in these regions are continuing to build out their networks. Our focus\nat Sonus has been to accelerate this development in the market with solutions\nthat enable consumer and business services. As we reported to you a few weeks\nago, NTT and Softbank Broadband both continue to build out their voice over\nbroadband networks with a Sonus solution.\n\nWe are at an inflection point in the market which represents an exciting\nopportunity for Sonus. There are clear and immediate growth drivers for Sonus'\nbusiness. The trunking market is continuing to expand, the access market is just\nbeginning to unfold and the wireless market is starting to move to voice over\nIP. Sonus is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this market shift. We have\nbeen solely focused on the development of voice over IP networks since our\ninception. The reliability and scalability of our solutions have been proven,\ncarrying 8.5 billion minutes per month of customer traffic in wireline and\nwireless networks globally. Our belief is that with relentless execution and\ncontinual focus, Sonus will become a predominant force in the telecommunications\nindustry.\n\nSo, in summary, the second quarter was a strong quarter for Sonus and we\nexecuted on many fronts. We are continuing to build on the momentum we\nestablished last year and are further expanding our position in this exciting\nmarket. There are important growth drivers fueling the adoption of Sonus'\nsolutions by carriers around the world. Our company has emerged from a\nchallenging phase with a strong financial position and a growing business. I\nwant to once again thank our customers, partners, shareholders and employees for\ntheir continued support. We accomplished a tremendous amount during the first\nhalf of 2004 and I look forward to updating you on our progress as we go through\nthe remainder of the year.\n\nLet me now ask Bert to review the financial performance of the Company.  Bert?\n\n                                       5\n", u'\n\nBert Notini, president and chief operating officer:\n\nThank you Hassan and good morning everyone.\n\nStarting with the income statement, our second quarter revenue was $42.4\nmillion, up 16% sequentially from the $36.5 million we reported in the first\nquarter. Qwest Communications, AT&T Wireless and Volo Communications each\ncontributed at least 10% of our revenue during the quarter. In total, these\ncustomers comprised approximately 48% of our Q2 revenue. To give you another\nperspective on our customer concentration, our top 5 customers represented 60%\nof our revenue in the second quarter compared to 80% in Q1. We derived revenue\nfrom a total of 37 customers this quarter, as compared to 35 in the first\nquarter.\n\nService revenue for the quarter was $11.8 million, compared to $10.3 million in\nthe first quarter.\n\nRevenue from our international customers represented 13% of the total for the\nsecond quarter, compared to the 29% reported in the first quarter, resulting in\n20% for the first half of 2004. The lower percentage of international revenue on\na sequential basis reflects the uneven ordering pattern of our customers, as\nwell as the conversion of those orders to revenue. We are pleased that our\nEuropean customers in the second quarter, including T-Systems, the international\ndivision of Deutsche Telekom, were meaningful contributors to our international\nrevenue. We believe there is a significant opportunity for us to grow our\nbusiness outside of the United States over time and continue to extend our brand\nto a diverse set of international markets.\n\nGross margin for the second quarter was 67.1% of revenue, up sequentially from\n66.1% in Q1. This performance exceeds our long-term model of 58 to 62%,\nprimarily as a result of favorable product mix. For instance, similar to Q1 of\nthis year, software revenue in the second quarter was proportionately higher\nthan historical levels and carries a higher gross margin. There was also a\npositive impact to gross margin in the second quarter resulting from the sale of\ninventory previously written down of approximately $850,000.\nLooking forward, we anticipate our gross margins will trend back to our\nlong-term model, although we may continue to see a favorable mix again in the\nthird quarter.\n\nOur operating expenses in the second quarter were $24 million, up from the $21.6\nmillion we reported in Q1. I would note that in Q2, $3.5 million of expense was\nattributable to our detailed financial review and audit, as compared to $3.1\nmillion in Q1.\n\nFrom a non-cash perspective, depreciation was $1.3 million, stock-based\ncompensation was $136,000 and amortization of purchased intangibles was\n$600,000. We expect stock-based compensation expense and amortization of\npurchased intangibles for Q3 to remain at about the same levels as in Q2, while\ndepreciation will increase modestly as a reflection of the capital investments\nwe have been making to support our growth.\n\n                                       6\n', u"\n\nR&D expense in the quarter was flat with Q1 at $8.9 million. During the first\nhalf of 2004, we have seen an increased demand for our access and wireless\nsolutions. In connection with this increase in order activity, we are making\nnecessary investments and added engineers at the end of Q2. From a timing\nperspective, these investments will be fully reflected in our R&D expense in Q3.\n\nSales and marketing expense was $8.6 million in Q2, compared to $6.9 million in\nQ1, with the increase largely driven by sales commissions, trade show activity\nand evaluation inventory shipped to customers and prospects.\n\nG&A expense was $5.7 million in Q2, compared to the $4.8 million we reported in\nQ1. Our increased G&A expense during the quarter reflects $500,000 related to an\nincrease in the renewal premium for our directors and officers insurance that\noccurred on May 31, 2004. It is important to note that in each of the next three\nquarters our G&A expense will reflect $1.7 million for amortization of insurance\npremiums paid in the second quarter. In the third quarter, we will continue to\nexperience some of the unusual expenses we have seen during Q1 and Q2, albeit at\na somewhat lower level. On the other hand, we are making investments in our\noperations and controls environment that will add to our normalized run rate\nlevel over time.\n\nQ2 interest income, net of interest expense, was $770,000, compared to $643,000\nin Q1. The increase reflects higher yields on the mix of our cash portfolio.\n\nAs to income taxes, in the near term we expect to provide for and pay de minimus\nincome taxes related to jurisdictions outside the US and minimum amounts due to\nstate and federal governments. We do not expect our effective tax rate to be\nmeaningful due to our net operating loss carry forwards, which coming into this\nyear amounted to approximately $190 million for federal income tax purposes.\n\nRegarding share count, we ended the second quarter with fully diluted shares\nused for EPS calculations of 250 million shares, down 5 million shares from the\nprevious quarter. The share count is lower in Q2 than Q1 as a result of the\neffect that our average share price has on the calculation of diluted shares.\n\nTaking all of this together, we are pleased that during this period when Sonus\nwas completing its financial review, we remained profitable on a GAAP basis. In\nthe second quarter, we increased our profitability to $4.9 million, or $0.02 per\nshare, compared to a profit of $3.0 million, or $0.01 per share in Q1.\n\nWe ended the quarter with 471 employees, reflecting an increase of approximately\n8% from where we were at the end of Q1. Of these additions, 80% were in our\nsales, R&D and service organizations.\n\nNow let's turn to the balance sheet, which continues to be very strong.\n\n                                       7\n", u"\n\nWe ended the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities of $303.6 million. This is down slightly from our Q1 balance due to\npayments related to our financial review and audit as well as investments in\nworking capital, including the payment for our insurance premium of $6.8\nmillion.\n\nOur accounts receivable were $31.9 million, with unearned receivables of $16.2\nmillion. As a reminder, our unearned receivables balance reflects the portion of\nour deferred revenue for which we have not yet received payment. Our DSOs on our\nearned receivables balance was 34 days. If you were to include unearned\nreceivables, our DSO for the second quarter was 68 days.\n\nWe ended the quarter with $20.2 million of inventory, up from the $15.3 million\nreported in Q1, reflecting increased sales activity. I would note that more than\nhalf of our net inventory is associated with deferred revenue and has been\nshipped to our customers.\n\nOur total deferred revenue decreased slightly this quarter to $93 million from\n$94.8 million in Q1 as certain billings included in the Q1 balance were\nrecognized as revenue in the second quarter, largely offset by new deferred\nrevenue from some new customer shipments. The long-term portion of our deferred\nrevenue was essentially flat at $30.1 million as compared to the $29.5 million\nwe reported in Q1. The current portion of our deferred revenue was $62.9\nmillion, compared to $65.2 million in Q1. As a reminder, we now are recording\ndeferred revenue at the time the customer is billed pursuant to a contractual\nright and collection is probable rather than when we receive payment, which\nprovides you with greater visibility to our pre-revenue business cycle.\n\nWe used $2.2 million in cash from operations during the second quarter. CAPEX\nduring the quarter was $2.1 million.\n\nTurning now to the third quarter. We extended the momentum we experienced in the\nfirst quarter into Q2 to deliver a strong first half of 2004 for Sonus. Carriers\naround the world continued to deploy our solutions in the trunking and access\nportions of their networks and we successfully converted a number of our\nshipments into revenue. Additionally, in the wireless market, we have seen\nwireless operators adopting Sonus' trunking solutions and our partnership with\nMotorola is proceeding on track.\n\nWe nonetheless are mindful that a great many of our customer transactions arise\nfrom large contractual arrangements with multiple elements under which the exact\ndates when our billings will convert into revenue are uncertain. We added new\nbillings to our deferred revenue balance in the second quarter as our business\nexpanded and we are working steadily to convert these to revenue while we make\nnew shipments in the third quarter. Balancing these factors, we believe the\ndrivers of our business during the first half of 2004 will continue into the\nsecond half; however, we are going to refrain from providing specific revenue or\nearnings guidance for the third quarter.\n\n                                       8\n", u"\n\nLooking at the second half of 2004 as a whole, the market opportunity presented\nby the transition to packet voice is significant and we are at an exciting point\nin the market's development as more and more of the large incumbent carriers\nadopt packet voice for their future network deployments. While we are proud that\nthe number of these carriers selecting Sonus has been growing, it is important\nto keep in mind the timescales involved in these complex network deployments.\nThe transformation of the world's networks to voice over IP is a fundamental\nopportunity that will play out over an extended period of time. We are working\ndiligently at Sonus to lead the market and extend our competitive position.\n\nWith that, let's open the call up to questions.\n\n", u'\n', u'\n', u'\n-----END PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE-----\n']
