Those items are detailed toward the end of this\n     release.\n\no    Almost seven million  shares were  repurchased  during the first quarter of\n     fiscal 2005 for approximately $181 million.\n\nOMAHA,  Neb.,  Sept.  22, 2004 -- ConAgra Foods Inc.  (NYSE:  CAG), one of North\nAmerica\'s leading packaged food companies, today reported earnings for the first\nquarter  ended Aug. 29, 2004.  Net income for the quarter was $135  million,  or\n$0.26 per diluted share,  and includes  $0.02 per share of previously  announced\ncosts related to  implementing  efficiency  initiatives.  Earnings for the first\nquarter  last year were $195  million,  or $0.37 per diluted  share,  reflecting\ncontribution  from businesses the company no longer owns, as well as other items\nthat impact year-over-year comparability.\n\nSales for the company  increased 8% to $3.5 billion from $3.2 billion last year.\nCurrent  quarter  operating  profit was $341 million,  9% above the $312 million\nreported last year.  Current  quarter income from continuing  operations  before\nincome tax and the cumulative  effect of changes in accounting was $214 million,\n29% ahead of $166 million last fiscal year.\n\nBruce Rohde, chairman and chief executive officer, commented, "Our first quarter\nsales were very strong, reflecting excellent volumes for many of our brands. Our\nsales and marketing  initiatives are gaining  significant  momentum,  and we are\npleased with the progress."\n\nRohde  continued,  "And because we have taken some price  increases  and reduced\noperating  expenses in several areas, our overall  operating profit this quarter\nwas  solid,  but it was not as  strong  as we  wanted;  this was  mainly  due to\nsignificantly  increased  input costs  across the  industry.  As we plan for the\nbalance of this fiscal year, we expect to continue  making price  adjustments to\noffset  increased  input  costs,  as well as to  continue  growing  volumes  and\ncapitalizing  on  cost  savings  opportunities  so that  we  strengthen  margins\nthroughout the year."\n\n                      Retail Products (58% of total sales)\n\nSales for the Retail Products segment increased 9% to $2 billion,  the result of\n8% volume growth.\n\no    Brands posting sales gains include: ACT II, Armour,  Banquet,  Blue Bonnet,\n     Butterball,  Chef Boyardee,  Cook\'s,  DAVID,  Eckrich, Egg Beaters,  Hebrew\n     National,  Hunt\'s, Kid Cuisine,  Manwich,  Marie Callender\'s,  PAM, Parkay,\n     Peter Pan,  Reddi-wip,  Swiss Miss, and Wesson;  many of these increased at\n     double-digit rates.\n\no    Sales for the company\'s top 30 brands as a group,  which  represent  almost\n     80% of total segment sales,  grew 9%; category share trends for many of the\n     company\'s most significant brands showed solid year-over-year improvement.\n\nThe  strong  volume  performance   reflects   disciplined  sales  and  marketing\ninitiatives designed to continually strengthen brand equities, increase category\nshares,  expand  distribution,  optimize  return on  marketing  investment,  and\nimprove  profit  contribution  from new items.  The company  notes that  segment\nvolume  performance  in the first quarter last fiscal year was soft,  reflecting\nthe consolidation of the Retail Products sales force underway at that time. This\nconsolidation,  now  complete,  reduced  the role of brokers  and  resulted in a\ndirect approach for serving customers.  That transition has resulted in improved\nsales  execution,  which  contributed  to the  strong  volume  performance  this\nquarter.  During the quarter,  the segment\'s selling prices increased  slightly,\nwhich only partly offset higher input costs; additional price increases continue\nto be implemented to address increased raw material costs.\n\nThe Retail Products  segment  operating profit for the quarter was $213 million,\n3% above the $208  million  posted  last  year,  reflecting  the  strong  volume\nperformance  and a focus on  operating  cost  reduction in the face of increased\ninput costs.  Significantly  increased input costs negatively impacted operating\nprofit  growth and profit  margin,  as did $8 million of costs  associated  with\nimplementing  efficiency  initiatives.  Profits for branded processed meats were\nsignificantly  below prior year results,  reflecting a combination  of increased\ncosts and competitive challenges. The company expects price increases as well as\nthe  marketing  and operating  initiatives  underway to  accelerate  the rate of\noperating profit growth for this segment as the fiscal year progresses.\n\n\n                    Foodservice Products (26% of total sales)\n\nSales for the  Foodservice  Products  segment  were $905  million  for the first\nquarter,  an  increase of 3% over last year,  reflecting  price  increases  that\noffset increased input costs.  Sales for specialty potato and culinary  products\ngrew, while seafood sales declined due to market  conditions.  Segment operating\nprofit for the quarter was $67  million,  11% below the $76 million  posted last\nyear, largely due to $11 million of unfavorable production costs associated with\na  planned  plant  consolidation.  Results  also  include  $5  million  of costs\nassociated with implementing efficiency  initiatives.  The company expects price\nincreases  as  well as the  marketing  and  operating  initiatives  underway  to\naccelerate  the rate of operating  profit  growth for this segment as the fiscal\nyear progresses.\n\n                      Food Ingredients (16% of total sales)\n\nDuring the quarter, sales for the Food Ingredients segment increased 14% to $577\nmillion from $508 million last year.  Operating  profit more than doubled to $60\nmillion this year. The strong sales and operating profit increases are primarily\nthe result of a favorable environment for input merchandising operations.  Sales\nand operating profit results for the value-added  specialty  ingredients product\nlines were essentially equal to those of a year ago.\n\nEarnings from Equity Method Investments\nEquity  method  investment  earnings for the quarter were $14 million,  compared\nwith $11 million for the same quarter last year.\n\nCapital Resource Management & Corporate Expense\no    The company  repurchased nearly seven million shares of common stock during\n     the first  quarter at a total cost of  approximately  $181  million.  Since\n     announcing a $1 billion  share  repurchase  program in December  2003,  the\n     company has repurchased approximately 22 million shares for a total cost of\n     approximately $600 million.\n\no    Capital  expenditures  for  property,  plant,  and  equipment  totaled $105\n     million  compared  with $71 million last year;  the increase over last year\n     reflects  additional  investment in information  systems.  Depreciation and\n     amortization  expense was  approximately $89 million for the quarter versus\n     $85 million a year ago.  Dividends paid totaled $135 million.  Net interest\n     expense  for the quarter was $73  million  compared  with $65 million  last\n     year.\n\no    Corporate  expense  was $67  million  for the  quarter,  compared  with $92\n     million last year.  Prior year amounts  include  approximately  $22 million\n     related to a litigation settlement.\n\nNew Product News\nDuring the quarter the company announced its whole-grain flour, Ultragrain White\nWhole  Wheat,   its   proprietary   product  that  the  company  expects  to  be\nrevolutionary  in the  baking  industry.  Ultragrain  combines  the  nutritional\nbenefits of whole grains with the taste,  texture, and finished-baked  qualities\nof refined flour that consumers and bakers often prefer.  Ultragrain can be used\nin many applications including: bread, pizza crusts, pastas, tortillas,  snacks,\nand cereals among other uses.  Initial  inquiries from potential trade customers\nincluding food manufacturers,  bakeries,  and ingredients companies suggest that\nthe product has significant potential.\n\nAlso during the quarter,  Banquet  Crock-Pot  Classics,  the first complete meal\ndesigned  and  created  for   Crock-Pot   slow   cooking,   reached   nationwide\ndistribution, and is off to strong start. Banquet Crock-Pot Classics contain all\nof the  high-quality  ingredients  needed for a  slow-cooked  meal--like  tender\nmeats, fresh vegetables, hearty potatoes, and perfectly seasoned sauces--and are\nready to cook with less than five minutes of  preparation,  providing  consumers\nwith a convenient, on-demand homemade family meal.\n\nOutlook\nThe company  believes that the marketing  and  operating  initiatives  currently\nbeing  implemented,  along  with  appropriate  price  increases,  and the  share\nrepurchase  program,  will drive a solid EPS  performance  this fiscal year; the\ncompany  expects the  benefit of its  profit-enhancing  initiatives  and pricing\nactions  to be more  apparent  in the  company\'s  profit  margins  (profit  as a\npercentage of sales) during the second half of the fiscal year than in the first\nhalf.\n\nFor more detail on the company\'s  financial goals, please refer to the company\'s\nWeb site,  www.conagrafoods.com/investors,  and  choose  the  button  titled\n"ConAgra Foods Comments on Strategic Direction."\n\nMajor Items Affecting  Year-Over-Year  EPS  Comparability of First-Quarter  2005\nResults\n\nIncluded in the $0.26 diluted EPS for the first quarter of fiscal 2005:\no    Current quarter results include expense of approximately  $0.02 per diluted\n     share related to implementing cost-saving initiatives.\no    Current quarter results do not include any  significant  contribution  from\n     operations now classified as discontinued.\n\nIncluded in the $0.37 diluted EPS for the first quarter of fiscal 2004:\no    Prior year  results  include a  tax-related  benefit  of $0.12 per  diluted\n     share.\no    Prior  year  results  include  $0.07  per  diluted  share  of  income  from\n     discontinued operations.\no    Prior  year  results  include  approximately  $0.03  per  diluted  share of\n     litigation expense, which was classified as a corporate SG&A expense.\no    Prior year  results  include  $0.02 per diluted  share of expense  from the\n     cumulative  effect of an accounting change relating to the adoption of SFAS\n     143.\n\nConAgra Foods Inc.

What was Corporate Expense for the quarter?\n\n         Approximately $67 million (vs. approximately $92 million in Q1 2004).\n         The main factor in the reduction in corporate expense is a $22 million\n         legal settlement in the prior year amounts.\n\n\n10.      How much did the company pay in dividends during the quarter?\n\n         $135 million.\n\n\n11.

Why are accounts receivable higher than last year?\n\n         Last year the company sold through securitization programs\n         approximately $420 million of accounts receivable. With the company's\n         strong cash position, the company has elected not to draw from its\n         asset securitization program, and as a result, the accounts receivable\n         balance is currently higher than it was last year.\n\n\n15.      What was the trade working capital position at quarter end, excluding\n         amounts for discontinued operations?\n\n         Trade working capital is defined as the net position of Accounts\n         Receivable plus Inventory less Current Operating Liabilities (Accounts\n         Payable, Accrued Expenses, and Advances on Sales).\n\n                                          Q1 FY05           Q1 FY04\n         Accounts Receivable*              $1,350            $  808\n         Inventory                         $2,640            $2,543\n         Less: Accounts Payable            $  874            $  849\n         Less: Accrued Expenses            $1,423            $1,559\n         Less: Advances on Sales           $  103            $  113\n                                          --------          -------\n                  Net Position             $1,590            $  830\n\n         * Please note question 14 regarding higher accounts receivable balance.\n\n\n16.      What is the preliminary estimate of the effective tax rate for fiscal\n         2005?\n\n         Approximately 38%.\n\n\n17.      What are projected Capital Expenditures for fiscal 2005?\n\n         Approximately $475 million, reflecting increased investment in\n         information systems and the logistics network.\n\n\n18.      What is the expected net interest expense for fiscal 2005?\n\n         Approximately $315 million.\n\n\n19.      The first quarter of fiscal 2005 reflected $0.02 per share of expense\n         related to implementing cost savings initiatives. Does the company have\n         any additional comments on the initiatives?\n\n          o    The company expects $0.01 per share of additional  expense in the\n               second  quarter  resulting  in a total of $0.03 per share for the\n               full fiscal year of 2005.\n          o    As part of efforts  to  improve  the  company's  cost  structure,\n               margins,  and  competitive  position,  the  company is  currently\n               implementing a series of  initiatives  that will better align and\n               utilize the company's collective resources.\n          o    The  initiatives  were  started in the  second  quarter of fiscal\n               2004,  and have  continued  into fiscal 2005.  These  initiatives\n               include:\n               >>   Elimination of duplicative costs and overhead;\n               >>   Consolidation of selected plants and support functions;\n               >>   Efforts to streamline and improve our ability to do business\n                    with our customers, distributors and brokers; and\n               >>   Realignment of business organizations.\n          o    These  initiatives  are  expected  to be more than offset by cost\n               savings in the future.\n\n\n20.      During the quarter, did the company receive any proceeds related to\n         the previous divestitures?\n\n         During the quarter, the company collected approximately $60 million of\n         receivables related to the divestiture of United Agri Products; no gain\n         or loss resulted from this collection.\n\n\n21.      What does the company plan to do with the $300 million of 7.4%\n         subordinated debt due September 2004?\n\n         The company repaid the debt on September 15th.\n\n\n", u'\n', u'\n', u'\n-----END PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE-----\n']
