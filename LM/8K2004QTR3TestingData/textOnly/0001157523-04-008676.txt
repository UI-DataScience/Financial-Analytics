Diluted earnings per share were $0.76 compared with\n$1.15 a year ago and $1.10 in the second quarter. The annualized\nreturn on average common equity was 12.3 percent in the current\nquarter, as compared with 22.0 percent in the third quarter of 2003\nand 18.4 percent in the second quarter of 2004.\n    Net revenues (total revenues less interest expense and the\nprovision for loan losses) of $5.4 billion were 3 percent higher than\nlast year\'s third quarter but 18 percent below this year\'s second\nquarter. Non-interest expenses of $4.1 billion were 23 percent higher\nthan a year ago, but 15 percent below last quarter. In the third\nquarter of 2003, the year-to-date effect of changes to the terms of\nthe Company\'s equity-based compensation program reduced compensation\nexpense by $519 million and increased net income by $350 million,\ndiluted earnings per share by $0.32 and the annualized return on\naverage common equity by 6.1 percentage points.\n\n    Business Highlights\n\n    - For the first eight months of calendar 2004, the Company ranked\n        first in global equity and equity-linked issuances, first in\n        global IPOs, and second in both global debt issuances and\n        global completed M&A.\n\n    - Firmwide assets under management reached $510 billion at quarter\n        end, an 18 percent increase from a year ago.1\n\n    - Credit quality at Discover Card continued to improve, with net\n        charge-off and delinquency rates at their lowest levels in\n        more than three years. Pre-tax earnings were $330 million --\n        up 13 percent from a year ago and Discover Card\'s second best\n        quarter in four years.\n\n    Philip J. Purcell, chairman and CEO, said, "Our firm continued to\ngenerate significant momentum with clients. In investment banking, we\ncompleted several landmark deals. Our Investment Management business\nand Discover Card also performed well, but reduced trading revenues\nresulted in lower quarterly earnings for the firm."\n    The Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $42 million in the current\nquarter related to the markdown of certain aircraft that are subject\nto a probable sale and, accordingly, have been designated as "held for\nsale". The revenues and expenses associated with these aircraft have\nbeen classified as "discontinued operations" for all periods\npresented.\n    For the first nine months of 2004, net income was $3,286 million,\nan 18 percent increase over $2,773 million a year ago. Diluted\nearnings per share were $2.97, up 18 percent from a year ago. Net\nrevenues rose 16 percent to $18.3 billion and non-interest expenses\nincreased 16 percent to $13.3 billion. The annualized return on\naverage common equity for the nine-month period was 16.6 percent\ncompared with 16.3 percent last year.\n\n    INSTITUTIONAL SECURITIES\n\n    Institutional Securities posted pre-tax income2 of $682 million,\ndown 43 percent from the third quarter of 2003 -- largely driven by\nhigher non-interest expenses, which included the impact of last year\'s\ncompensation program changes. Net revenues of $2.8 billion were 1\npercent lower, reflecting a decline in fixed income sales and trading\nrevenues, largely offset by improved results in advisory and\nunderwriting activities, and higher equity sales and trading revenues.\n\n    - Fixed income sales and trading net revenues were $1.2 billion,\n        down 19 percent from the third quarter of 2003. Revenues\n        declined sharply in interest rate & currency products. Mixed\n        U.S. economic data coupled with higher global energy prices\n        led to concerns about the strength of economic growth, and\n        resulted in a more difficult trading environment. Commodities\n        had another strong quarter, although slightly lower than last\n        year, as tight oil supplies, concerns about production\n        disruptions and growing demand drove energy prices and\n        volatilities higher. Credit products revenues were modestly\n        lower this quarter.\n\n    - Equity sales and trading net revenues increased 6 percent from\n        last year to $883 million. The increase was driven primarily\n        by higher revenues from the Company\'s Prime Brokerage and cash\n        businesses. This quarter\'s revenues were impacted by\n        continuing low levels of market volatility, which reduced\n        trading opportunities.\n\n    - The Company\'s aggregate average trading VaR was $79 million in\n        the current quarter compared with $54 million in the third\n        quarter of last year, and $72 million in the second quarter of\n        2004.\n\n    - Advisory revenues were $310 million, a 138 percent increase from\n        last year\'s third quarter. There was a significant increase in\n        the Company\'s market share in completed M&A transactions and a\n        62 percent increase in industry-wide completed M&A activity\n        over the same period.3\n\n    - Underwriting revenues were $401 million, up 3 percent from last\n        year\'s third quarter. Equity underwriting revenues rose 9\n        percent. While industry-wide equity underwriting activity fell\n        12 percent compared to last year, the Company\'s volume of\n        activity increased 12 percent over the same period. The\n        Company\'s equity global market share rose from 7 percent a\n        year ago to 9 percent in the current quarter. Fixed income\n        underwriting revenues declined 2 percent from a year ago,\n        compared with a 1 percent increase in industry-wide activity.\n        The Company\'s fixed income global market share remained at 8\n        percent.3\n\n    - For the calendar year-to-date, the Company ranked first in\n        global equity and equity-linked issuances with a 12 percent\n        market share, first in global IPOs with a 15 percent market\n        share, second in global debt issuances with a 7 percent market\n        share, second in completed global M&A with a 32 percent market\n        share and fourth in announced global M&A with a 24 percent\n        market share.4 Landmark transactions completed during the\n        quarter included the $1.9 billion Google IPO, the $3.1 billion\n        Deutsche PostBank IPO and the defense of Aventis resulting in\n        its $65.7 billion sale to Sanofi-Synthelabo S.A. Significant\n        M&A transactions announced during the quarter included\n        National Grid Transco\'s $10.7 billion asset sale and the $1.4\n        billion sale of Marks & Spencer Money to HSBC.\n\n    - Non-interest expenses for the quarter rose 32 percent to $2.1\n        billion. Compensation expense increased because last year\'s\n        third quarter included the year-to-date impact of changes in\n        the Company\'s equity-based compensation program. In addition,\n        higher levels of business activity resulted in increases in\n        the professional services and other expense categories.\n        Expected costs related to legal and regulatory matters\n        increased to approximately $50 million, driven by a failure to\n        deliver certain prospectuses pursuant to regulatory\n        requirements.\n\n    INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR GROUP\n\n    The Individual Investor Group posted pre-tax income of $22\nmillion, an 88 percent decline from last year\'s third quarter. The\ndecline in earnings resulted from higher non-interest expenses,\npartially offset by a modest increase in net revenues.\n\n    - Total net revenues rose 2 percent from a year ago to $1.1\n        billion, driven by a 28 percent increase in asset management,\n        distribution and administration fees, reflecting higher client\n        asset levels in fee-based accounts. This increase was largely\n        offset by declines of 12 percent in commissions and 25 percent\n        in principal transaction trading revenues resulting from lower\n        sales of fixed income products.\n\n    - Non-interest expenses increased 21 percent from a year ago to\n        $1.1 billion. Compensation expense was higher because last\n        year\'s third quarter included the year-to-date impact of\n        changes in the Company\'s equity-based compensation program.\n        Also, legal and regulatory expenses increased approximately\n        $70 million, of which the largest driver was expected costs\n        associated with a failure to deliver certain prospectuses\n        pursuant to regulatory requirements.\n\n    - Total client assets were $576 billion, a 6 percent increase from\n        last year\'s third quarter and a decrease of 1 percent from\n        this year\'s second quarter. Client assets in fee-based\n        accounts rose 20 percent to $146 billion over the past twelve\n        months and increased as a percentage of total client assets to\n        25 percent from 22 percent over the same period.\n\n    - At quarter-end, the number of global financial advisors was\n        10,785 -- 541 lower than a year ago but an increase of 63 over\n        the quarter.\n\n    INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT\n\n    Investment Management pre-tax income rose 33 percent from last\nyear\'s third quarter to $217 million. Net revenues increased 16\npercent to $692 million, driven by higher investment gains and an\nincrease in average assets under management. Non-interest expenses\nrose 9 percent to $475 million on higher compensation expenses\nreflecting the increase in net revenues, as well as the impact of last\nyear\'s compensation program change.\n\n    - Assets under management within Investment Management were $394\n        billion, $49 billion above the third quarter of last year. The\n        increase resulted from both market appreciation and positive\n        net flows.\n\n    - Institutional assets were $200 billion, an increase of $45\n        billion from a year ago. The increase in institutional assets\n        reflected market appreciation and the continuation of robust\n        growth in liquidity products. Retail assets of $194 billion\n        were $4 billion higher than a year ago.\n\n    - Among full-service brokerage firms, the Company had the highest\n        number of domestic funds (37) receiving one of Morningstar\'s\n        two highest ratings.5 In addition, the percent of the\n        Company\'s fund assets performing in the top half of the Lipper\n        rankings was 60 percent over one year, 70 percent over three\n        years and 76 percent over five years.6\n\n    - Investment gains for the quarter were $90 million, up from $10\n        million a year ago and included approximately $75 million\n        associated with an ownership interest in Vanguard Health\n        Systems.\n\n    CREDIT SERVICES\n\n    Credit Services posted pre-tax income of $330 million on a managed\nbasis, up 13 percent from last year\'s third quarter. The increase was\ndriven by a lower provision for loan losses, reflecting improved\ncredit quality, partially offset by a decline in net interest income,\nlower merchant and cardmember fees and higher non-interest expenses\ndriven by an increase in marketing expenses.\n\n    - Managed credit card loans of $47.1 billion at quarter end were 6\n        percent lower than a year ago although slightly above the\n        level at the beginning of the quarter. Net interest income\n        fell $100 million from a year ago, reflecting the decline in\n        credit card loan balances and a narrower interest rate spread,\n        which contracted eight basis points to 8.83 percent, as a\n        lower yield more than offset lower cost of funds.\n\n    - Managed merchant and cardmember fees were $499 million, down 5\n        percent from a year ago, primarily due to lower late and\n        overlimit fees. The decline in these fees reflected sharply\n        lower credit card delinquencies.\n\n    - Transaction volume increased 2 percent to $25.4 billion, the\n        second highest quarterly volume ever.\n\n    - The managed credit card net charge-off rate for the third\n        quarter was 5.76 percent, 114 basis points below a year ago --\n        and its lowest level in more than three years. The decrease\n        reflects the effect of the Company\'s credit and collection\n        initiatives and an industry-wide improvement in credit\n        quality, including the stabilization of bankruptcy filings.\n\n    - The managed credit card over-30-day delinquency rate was 4.81\n        percent, a decrease of 124 basis points from the third quarter\n        of 2003. The managed credit card over-90-day delinquency rate\n        was 2.22 percent, 69 basis points lower than a year ago.\n\n    - Non-interest expenses of $567 million rose 5 percent from a year\n        ago, primarily due to increased marketing expenses, largely\n        related to account acquisition activity and merchant\n        initiatives.\n\n    As of August 31, 2004, the Company had repurchased approximately 9\nmillion shares of its common stock since the end of fiscal 2003. The\nCompany also announced that its Board of Directors declared a $0.25\nquarterly dividend per common share. The dividend is payable on\nOctober 29, 2004, to common shareholders of record on October 8, 2004.\n    Total capital at August 31, 2004 was $101.2 billion, including\n$30.3 billion of common shareholders\' equity and junior subordinated\ndebt issued to capital trusts. Book value per common share was $25.00,\nbased on 1.1 billion shares outstanding.\n\n    OTHER MATTERS\n\n    The Company also announced that it has reached an agreement in\nprinciple with the Staff of the New York Stock Exchange relating to\nits failure to comply with certain prospectus delivery requirements,\noperational deficiencies, employee defalcations (including the Soto\nmatter) and other matters. The settlement will include a fine of $19\nmillion. Negotiations with the Staff about the details of the\nresolution have not concluded, and no assurance can be given that a\nresolution will be achieved.\n    Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm and a market\nleader in securities, investment management and credit services.

F-18) present a reconciliation for certain\ninformation disclosed on pages F-7, F-13 and F-15.\n\n\nThe data is presented on both a "managed" loan basis and as reported\nunder generally accepted accounting principles ("owned" loan basis).\nManaged loan data assume that the Company\'s securitized loan\nreceivables have not been sold and presents the results of securitized\nloan receivables in the same manner as the Company\'s owned loans.\nThe Company operates its Credit Services business and analyzes its\nfinancial performance on a managed basis.  Accordingly, underwriting\nand servicing standards are comparable for both owned and securitized\nloans.  The Company believes that managed loan information is useful\nto investors because it provides information regarding the quality of\nloan origination and credit performance of the entire managed\nportfolio and allows investors to understand the related credit risks\ninherent in owned loans and retained interests in securitizations.\nIn addition, investors often request information on

The Company views the adjusted leverage ratio as\na more relevant measure of financial risk when comparing financial\nservices firms and evaluating leverage trends.  Adjusted assets\nexclude certain self-funded assets considered to have minimal market,\ncredit and/or liquidity risk that are generally attributable to\nmatched book and securities lending businesses as measured by\naggregate resale agreements and securities borrowed less non-\nderivative short positions.  In addition, the adjusted leverage\nratio reflects the deduction from shareholders\' equity of the amount\nof equity used to support goodwill and intangible assets, as the\nCompany does not view this amount of equity as available to support\nits risk capital needs.\n\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n                             MORGAN STANLEY\n                    Reconciliation of Adjusted Assets\n             (unaudited, dollars in millions, except ratios)\n\n\n                                            Quarter Ended\n                                 -------------------------------------\n                                   Aug 31,      Aug 31,      May 31,\n                                    2004         2003         2004\n                                 -----------  -----------  -----------\n\nTotal assets                     $  745,033   $  580,632   $  729,501\n\nLess:\n Securities purchased under\n  agreements to resell              (92,816)     (74,271)     (96,042)\n Securities borrowed               (202,863)    (162,366)    (202,412)\nAdd:\n Financial instruments sold,\n  not yet purchased                 132,618      112,054      130,440\nLess:\n Derivative contracts sold,\n  not yet purchased                 (39,425)     (36,008)     (41,615)\n                                 -----------  -----------  -----------\n Subtotal                           542,547      420,041      519,872\nLess:\n Segregated customer cash and\n   securities balances              (35,194)     (25,670)     (29,918)\n Assets recorded under certain\n  provisions of SFAS No. 140\n  and FIN 46                        (40,057)     (28,920)     (40,279)\nGoodwill and intangible assets       (2,191)      (1,466)      (1,531)\n                                 -----------  -----------  -----------\nAdjusted assets                  $  465,105   $  363,985   $  448,144\n                                 ===========  ===========  ===========\n\nShareholders\' equity             $   27,420   $   23,707   $   27,002\nJunior subordinated debt issued\n to capital trusts (1)                2,897        2,810        2,897\n                                 -----------  -----------  -----------\n Subtotal                            30,317       26,517       29,899\nLess:\n Goodwill and intangible assets      (2,191)      (1,466)      (1,531)\n                                 -----------  -----------  -----------\nTangible shareholders\' equity    $   28,126   $   25,051   $   28,368\n                                 ===========  ===========  ===========\n\nLeverage ratio (2)                     26.5x        23.2x        25.7x\n                                 ===========  ===========  ===========\n\nAdjusted leverage ratio (3)            16.5x        14.5x        15.8x\n                                 ===========  ===========  ===========\n\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(1)   The Company views the junior subordinated debt issued to capital\n      trusts as a component of its equity capital base given the\n      inherent characteristics of the securities.
