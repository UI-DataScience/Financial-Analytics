August 25, 2004 - Zygo Corporation (NASDAQ: ZIGO) announced\ntoday that it has entered into an agreement to sell its vacant Westborough,\nMassachusetts, facility. The sales transaction, anticipated to be completed in\nthe fall of 2004, is expected to generate approximately $2.0 million in cash,\nnet of selling expenses. The Company also announced that an impairment charge\nwill be recorded of $4.9 million, net of tax, in the fourth fiscal quarter ended\nJune 30, 2004 to reflect the change in the fair market value of the property.\n\nBruce Robinson, Zygo\'s Chief Executive Officer, commented: "The weak local real\nestate market for clean room space has continued and this agreement reflects the\nculmination of many months of diligent marketing efforts. This sale will mark\nthe completion of our exit from the telecommunications segment of our business."\n\nZygo Corporation, headquartered in Middlefield, Connecticut, is a worldwide\nsupplier of optical metrology instruments, precision optics, and electro-optical\ndesign and manufacturing services, serving customers in the semiconductor\ncapital equipment and industrial markets.

Forward-looking statements are\nintended to provide management\'s current expectations or plans for the future\noperating and financial performance of the Company based upon information\ncurrently available and assumptions currently believed to be valid.\nForward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as\n"anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "plans," "strategy,"\n"project," and other words of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of\nfuture operating or financial performance.
