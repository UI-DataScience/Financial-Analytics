Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\nOn September 14, 2004, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors along with senior management of Ferro Corporation (the "Company") concluded that the financial statements issued for 2002, 2003 and the first quarter 2004 should no longer be relied upon and would be restated.', u'On July 23, 2004, the Company announced in a press release that its Polymer Additives business performance in the second quarter fell short of expectations, affecting Company earnings by approximately $0.12 per share. The Company also announced at that time it expected to take a $0.10 per share non-cash charge to earnings, or approximately $4.5 million after tax, as a result of inappropriate accounting entries (which included both irregular accounting entries and accounting mistakes) that had been uncovered by the Company during its financial review process. ', u"Independent legal counsel and independent auditors (not Ferro's external auditors KPMG, LLP) conducted a thorough investigation, under the auspices of the Company\n146;s Audit Committee, related to the inappropriate accounting entries.  In a September 15, 2004 press release, the Company announced the independent investigation was complete and that it generally confirmed the previously announced findings.  A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.", u'The investigation found inappropriate accounting entries in the nature of potentially irregular entries totaling approximately $3.6 million before tax ($2.2 million after tax) for the Company\x92s fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003, and the first quarter of 2004.  The investigation concluded that all of the potentially irregular accounting entries were made in the Company\x92s Polymer Additives business unit and without any knowledge or involvement of senior management.   Substantially all of the potential irregular entries were made by a subordinate divisional employee who has since left the Company.  The majority of these entries involved the overstatement of certain asset accounts and the un\nderstatement of certain liabilities, resulting in the understatement of cost of sales.', u'The investigation also found during the same periods inappropriate accounting entries in the nature of mistakes amounting to $6.8 million before tax ($4.2 million after tax).  The mistakes primarily resulted from oversight or misuse of facts that existed at the time a given set of financial statements was prepared.  These included, for example, mistakes in the estimation of certain inventory reserves and raw material price variances, as well as failure to properly reconcile certain inventory and related liability accounts.  Generally, cost of sales was understated due to these mistakes.', u'Based on these investigation findings and after consultation with its external auditors, KPMG LLP, on September 14, 2004, the Company\x92s Audit Committee accepted management\x92s recommendation to restate the Company\x92s financial statements for fiscal years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003 and for fiscal quarter ended\n March 31, 2004.  This recommendation was made despite the fact that various quantitative and qualitative factors considered by management suggested that the adjustments for the inappropriate accounting entries might not be material to the Company\x92s financial statements for some of the periods considered.  Nonetheless, the Company will file an amended 2003 Form 10-K and an amended Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2004 as soon as practicable.', u'The Company and its Audit Committee advised its external auditors, KPMG LLP, of its findings and is working with KPMG to evaluate the effect of the investigation findings on current and prior period financial statements.  Pending completion of the restatement process, it is possible that additional adjustments of the current and prior period financial results could be identified.', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' Item END ', u'\n', u' PageBreak START ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Top of the Form', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' PageBreak END ', u' SignatureHeader START ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n\tSIGNATURES\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n\tPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the\n\tregistrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the\n\tundersigned hereunto duly authorized.\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' SignatureHeader END ', u' Signature START ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n\t\xa0\n', u'\n', u'\n\t\xa0\n', u'\n', u'\n\t\xa0\n', u'\n', u'\n\t\xa0\n', u'\n', u'\n\t\xa0\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n\t\xa0\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n\t\xa0\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n\tFerro Corporation\n', u'\n\t(Registrant)\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n\t\xa0\xa0\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n\t\xa0\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n\t\xa0\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n\t\xa0\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n\t\xa0\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n\tSeptember 15, 2004\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n\t\xa0\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n\tBy:\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n\t\xa0\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n\tHector R.

The Company also announced at that time it expected to take a $0.10 per share non-cash\ncharge to earnings, or approximately $4.5\xa0million after tax, related to inappropriate accounting\nentries (which included both irregular accounting entries and accounting mistakes) that had been\nuncovered by the Company during its financial review process.\n\n\n', u'A thorough investigation, conducted by independent legal counsel and independent auditors under the\nauspices of the Company\x92s Audit Committee, has now generally confirmed the findings reported in the\nJuly\xa023, 2004 press release. The investigation concluded that all of the potentially irregular\naccounting entries were made in the Polymer Additives business unit and without any knowledge or\ninvolvement of senior management. Substantially all of the irregular entries were made by a\nsubordinate divisional employee who has since left the Company.', u' ', u'The final investigation\nhas resulted in the Company taking an additional estimated non-cash charge of $0.02 per share, or\n$0.9\xa0million after tax. In addition, certain items that were initially included in the $0.12 per\nshare second quarter earnings shortfall announced on July\xa023, 2004, have been reclassified as\nnon-cash charges applicable to prior periods. The amount of such charges is approximately $0.02\nper share, or $1.1\xa0million after tax. Consequently, the total non-cash charge to earnings will be\nslightly less than $0.15 per share, or $6.4\xa0million after tax.', u'\n', u'Chairman and chief executive officer, Hector R. Ortino commented, \x93We have investigated this matter\nthoroughly and have corrected all of the inappropriate accounting entries. We are also instituting\nadditional protective measures in an effort to prevent similar entries from being made in the\nfuture. In addition, as part of our on-going program to assure the Company\x92s internal control\nsystems are in full compliance with applicable internal control requirements, we are evaluating\nfurther enhancements to the overall system of internal controls.\x94\n\n\n', u'Ferro advised its external auditors, KPMG LLP, of its findings and is working closely with KPMG to\nevaluate the effect of the investigation findings on current and prior-period financial statements.\nFinally, the Company has voluntarily disclosed its investigation findings to the Securities and\nExchange Commission, agreed to provide the SEC with relevant information concerning the\ninvestigation and agreed to continue cooperating with the SEC in its review of this matter.\n\n\n', u'The Company will be filing an amended Form 10-Q for it fiscal quarter ended March\xa031, 2004 and an\namended Form 10-K for its fiscal years ended December\xa031, 2003 and December\xa031, 2002, when it has\ncompleted its review of restated financial results for those periods. The Company will then file\nits Form 10-Q for its fiscal quarter ended June\xa030, 2004. Ferro has received a technical waiver\nfrom its bank group regarding the delay in providing quarterly financial reporting documents\nrequired under the Company\x92s revolving credit agreement.\n\n\n', u'Ortino further commented, \x93We are pleased to have the investigative process behind us and to have\nthe investigation findings generally confirm our preliminary assessment of this matter.
