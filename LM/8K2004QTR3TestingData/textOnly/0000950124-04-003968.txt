(AMEX:\nLCI). The Company's annual results of operations for the fiscal year ended June\n30, 2004 (Fiscal 2004) surpassed last year's record highs in sales, operating\nincome and net income.\n\n         Net sales increased from $42.5 million in Fiscal 2003 to $63.8 million\nin Fiscal 2004. Net sales rose from $12.2 million in the fourth quarter of\nFiscal 2003 to $18.0 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. These\nincreases were due primarily to recent introductions of new products, including\nLevothyroxine Sodium tablets and the branded product, Unithroid(R) tablets. In\naddition, the Company successfully increased its market share and sales revenue\nfor several of its other products.\n\n         Gross profit margins decreased from 62% in Fiscal 2003 to 58% in Fiscal\n2004, and from 63% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003 to 53% in the fourth\nquarter of Fiscal 2004. The decrease in gross profit margins is a result of a\ndecrease in net weighted average prices for some of the Company's products due\nto increased market competition, and increases in direct and indirect costs,\nincluding raw material prices, compensation and benefit expenses and\ndepreciation expense.\n\n         Research and development (R&D) expenses increased due to the Company's\ncontinued strategy of investing a portion of its profits in the development of\nnew\n\n", u"\n\ngeneric drug products. Total R&D expenses increased from $2.6 million in Fiscal\n2003 to $5.9 million in Fiscal 2004, and from $900,000 in the fourth quarter of\nFiscal 2003 to $2.4 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004. A significant\nportion of the increases in R&D expenses represents the cost of performing\ngeneric bioequivalence tests, which is commonly required for ANDA submissions.\nThe Company incurred approximately $2.3 million in Fiscal 2004 for\nbioequivalence testing fees, compared to $265,000 in Fiscal 2003. The remainder\nof the increase in R&D expenses was due to an increase in compensation and\nbenefit expenses and costs of raw materials used in the R&D process.\n\n         Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased from $4.3\nmillion in Fiscal 2003 to $8.9 million in Fiscal 2004, and from $1.1 million in\nthe fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003 to $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of\nFiscal 2004. SG&A expenses increased due to an increase in compensation and\nbenefit expenses, insurance premiums, professional service fees, consulting\nservices, advertising and other marketing expenses.\n\n         Included in the Fiscal 2004 results of operations are approximately\n$1.4 million in operating expenses not expected to recur in Fiscal 2005,\nincluding approximately $830,000 in incentive compensation costs, $270,000 in\nlegal and consulting fees related to the Company's successful efforts to prevent\na local union from organizing a portion of their employees and approximately\n$300,000 in other expenses, including fees for work performed by or under the\ndirection of the Special Committee of the\n\n", u"\n\n\nBoard of Directors, which was created as a result of an option granted by\nWilliam Farber, the Company's Chairman and majority stockholder, to Perrigo\nCompany, Inc. for the acquisition of shares owned by Mr. Farber and his wife,\nand any potential subsequent transaction between Perrigo Company, Inc. (Perrigo)\nand the remaining stockholders of the Company. As previously disclosed, Perrigo\nchose not to exercise the option previously granted.\n\n         The Company's results of operations also include approximately $1.3\nmillion in non-cash amortization expense related to the intangible asset created\nby an agreement whereby the Company exchanged four million (4,000,000) shares of\nits capital stock to Jerome Stevens Pharmaceutical, Inc. (JSP) for the exclusive\nmarketing and distribution rights to JSP's line of products. Operating income\nbefore the $1.3 million in amortization expense was $4.5 million for the fourth\nquarter of Fiscal 2004, compared to $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of the\nprior year. The decrease is a result of the increases in R&D and SG&A expenses.\nOn an annual basis, operating income before the $1.3 million in amortization\nexpense was $22.1 million for Fiscal 2004, compared to $19.3 million in Fiscal\n2003.\n\n         Net income decreased from $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal\n2003 to $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2004 as a result of the\namortization expense and the increases in R&D and SG&A expenses. On an annual\nbasis, net income increased from $11.7 million in Fiscal 2003 to $13.2 million\nin Fiscal 2004.\n\n", u"\n\n\n         The following table presents Lannett's unaudited results of
