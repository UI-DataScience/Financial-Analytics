Net income for\nthe quarter increased 19 percent to $71.3 million in 2004 compared to\n$59.9 million in 2003. During the quarter, the Company recorded a net\nreduction in certain income tax-related liabilities and related\ninterest accruals which increased net income by $7.4 million.\nExcluding these adjustments, net income for the second quarter of 2004\nwould have been $63.9 million, or $0.19 per share.\n    Net sales during the second quarter increased 11.2 percent to\n$1.84 billion compared to $1.65 billion in the second quarter of 2003.\nThe sales increase was driven by new store growth and a same-store\nsales increase of 3.2 percent.\n    Gross profit during the quarter was $537.0 million, or 29.2\npercent of sales, versus $472.8 million, or 28.6 percent of sales, in\nthe prior year quarter. The improvement in gross margin is primarily\nthe result of a higher average markup on beginning inventories and a\ndecrease in lower of cost or market inventory adjustments.\n    Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") for the\nquarter were $428.9 million, or 23.4 percent of sales, in the current\nyear, versus $371.0 million, or 22.5 percent of sales, in the prior\nyear quarter. The increase in SG&A as a percentage to sales is\nprimarily due to increased rental expense on the Company\'s leased\nfacilities, increased costs associated with store physical inventory\ncounts, increased labor relating to the execution of store layout\nchanges during the quarter, fees associated with the acceptance of\ndebit cards, and increased professional fees associated with the\nCompany\'s 2004 store work-flow project.\n    The Company\'s effective tax rate was 31.5 percent in the current\nyear quarter versus 36.2 percent in the comparable prior year period.\nThe current quarter\'s provision for income taxes reflects an\nadjustment of $6.2 million to reduce certain contingent state\nincome-tax related liabilities, net of the federal income tax effect.\nThe Company also reduced the interest accrual relating to these\ncontingent liabilities by $2.0 million. Excluding these adjustments,\nthe Company\'s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2004 would\nhave been 37.5 percent. This rate is higher than the Company\'s tax\nrate in the prior year period due in part to the expiration of certain\nfederal jobs tax credits.\n    For the 26-week year-to-date period, net income was $139.2 million\nin fiscal 2004, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to $120.3\nmillion, or $0.36 per diluted share, in the comparable prior year\nperiod. Excluding the effect of the income tax-related adjustments\ndescribed above, net income for the 26-week period would have been\n$131.7 million, or $0.39 per diluted share.\n    Year-to-date net sales increased 11.3 percent, including a\nsame-store sales increase of 3.1 percent. As a percentage to sales,\ngross margin for the year-to-date period has increased to 29.3 percent\nin 2004 compared to 28.7 percent in 2003. SG&A expenses have increased\nas a percentage to sales to 23.1 percent in 2004 from 22.4 percent in\n2003, with the most significant increases relating to increased rental\nexpense on the Company\'s leased facilities, increased costs associated\nwith store physical inventory counts, increased professional fees\nassociated with the Company\'s 2004 store work-flow project and\nincreased expenses resulting from the acceptance of debit cards.\n    The Company\'s effective tax rate was 34.4 percent in the current\nyear-to-date period versus 35.9 percent in the comparable prior year\nperiod. Excluding the adjustments to reduce certain contingent income\ntax-related liabilities, the Company\'s effective tax rate would have\nbeen 37.3 percent. This rate is higher than the Company\'s tax rate in\nthe prior year period due in part to the expiration of certain federal\njobs tax credits. The Company estimates that the expiration of these\nfederal tax credit programs increased its 2004 effective tax rate by\napproximately 0.5 percent. The Company estimates that its effective\nincome tax rate for the remainder of the 2004 fiscal year will be\napproximately 37.3 percent.\n    Through July 30, 2004, the Company has opened 418 Dollar General\nstores and two Dollar General Markets and has closed 41 Dollar General\nstores. Store openings are on track to meet or exceed the Company\'s\ntarget of 695 total new stores this year. Year-to-date cash capital\nexpenditures were $124.8 million.\n    The Company has repurchased a total of approximately 10.5 million\nshares of its common stock to date, including 0.9 million shares\npurchased during the second quarter of 2004, with respect to its 12\nmillion share repurchase authorization which expires on March 13,\n2005. Year-to-date, the Company has repurchased 9.0 million shares at\na total cost of $169.4 million.\n    Dollar General also announced today that in addition to cash and\npersonal checks, substantially all of its stores are now accepting any\nbank\'s debit and check cards via pin entry as well as Discover(R)Card.\nIn addition, the Company has accelerated the pace of EBT acceptance in\nits stores with refrigerated coolers and is currently accepting EBT in\nover 3,000 stores.\n\n    Non-GAAP Disclosures\n\n    This press release and the tables accompanying this release\ninclude certain financial information not derived in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), including net\nincome, earnings per share, and the Company\'s effective income tax\nrate excluding an adjustment resulting from the reduction of certain\nincome tax liabilities and the related interest accruals.
