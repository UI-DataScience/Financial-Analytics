PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 15, 2004---\n\n       Conference call is Thursday, Sept. 30, 2004 at 4:30 pm ET (3:30 CT)\n\n     Lawson Software, Inc. (Nasdaq:LWSN) today announced preliminary first\nquarter fiscal 2005 results. The company expects total revenues of approximately\n$82 million, including license revenues of approximately $13 million. The\ncompany also expects to report GAAP net loss per share of $0.01 to $0.02 and\nnon-GAAP earnings per share of break-even to $0.01, adjusting for approximately\n$2 million of items consisting primarily of non-cash stock-based compensation,\namortization of acquired software and intangibles and acquired maintenance\ncontracts, and a deferred tax valuation allowance.\n     "In our first quarter, Lawson experienced what many other enterprise\nsoftware companies have recently announced - lower business activity, longer\ncustomer decision cycles, and contract deferrals," said Coughlan. "Issues\naffecting our industry including uncertainty related to the pending decision on\nUnited States of America v. Oracle, the prospect of industry consolidation, and\npriorities such as Sarbanes-Oxley impacting customers\' capital spending on\nsoftware adversely impacted Lawson\'s software licensing activity as well.\nAlthough I am disappointed in the low level of licensing activity in the\nquarter, I am pleased with our ability to manage business expenses aggressively\nand lessen the impact on our EPS. In addition, we remain committed to increasing\nnon-GAAP profitability and operating margin expansion on a full-year basis\ncompared to fiscal 2004 results. We are focused on continued prudent management\nof our business."\n     Coughlan also commented, "Lawson continues to be a compelling choice for\nmid to large size services-oriented organizations\' ERP business needs, and our\n2,000 customers know Lawson has a strong, competitive standing as one of the key\nERP providers in the marketplace."\n     Lawson will release its first quarter results Thursday, Sept. 30, 2004,\nafter the market closes. The company will host a conference call to discuss its\nfirst quarter results and future outlook at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (3:30 p.m.\nCentral Time) Sept. 30, 2004.\n     Interested parties may listen to the call by dialing 888-603-9617 (passcode\nLawson 930) and international callers 1-517-308-9002. A live webcast will also\nbe available on www.lawson.com.

The final results for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 of Lawson\nSoftware may differ from the preliminary results discussed above.
