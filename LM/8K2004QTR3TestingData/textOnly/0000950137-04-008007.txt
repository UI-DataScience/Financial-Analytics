(Nasdaq: OUTL) today\nreported net sales of $17,207,000 for the first quarter ended August 28, 2004,\nan increase from sales of $17,061,000 for the first quarter of the prior year.\nNet earnings were $703,000 or $0.21 per diluted share for the first quarter of\nfiscal 2005, compared to a net loss of $207,000 or ($0.06) per diluted share for\nthe same period in the prior year.\n\n"We continued our steady improvement in the first quarter. Among other factors,\nthe significant increase in earnings reflected the gains in production\nefficiency we are realizing as a result of the investments we made last year in\nnew equipment and training for several major long-term projects. We also\ncompleted a number of profitable one-time projects in the first quarter," said\nJoseph J. Baksha, president and chief operating officer of Outlook Group.\n\n"Although the industry environment continues to be very challenging, our\nstrategy to differentiate Outlook Group by offering a complete portfolio of\nsupply chain management solutions has proven to be very successful. We added\nseveral new long-term agreements in the first quarter, including a five-year\nagreement for the production of Cool Qube(TM) high-end tissue boxes developed by\nTrinova Design," said Baksha. "Including the new business, long-term agreements\nnow account for approximately 75% of our total annualized sales."\n\nBaksha said that while the company\'s focus is on supply chain management\nsolutions, printing continues to be a foundation of the business. "Our high\nquality printing capabilities were recently recognized by the `Benny\' we\nreceived in the 2004 Premier Print Awards for our new corporate capabilities\nbrochure. This is the graphic arts industry\'s largest and most prestigious\nworldwide print competition," he noted.\n\n\n                                     -more-\n\n', u'\n\nPage 2\n\nOutlook Group Corp. is a printing, packaging and direct marketing company\noffering a variety of related services to clients in markets including contract\npackaging, collateral information management and distribution, direct marketing\ncomponents and services, packaging components and materials and specialty print\nrelated services.
