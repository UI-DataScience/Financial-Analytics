A copy of the press\n         release issued by the Company relating thereto is furnished herewith as\n         Exhibit 99.1.\n\n\nITEM 2.05         COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES\n\n         On September 7, 2004, we committed to attempt to sell our 39% interest\n         in a joint venture which operates a factory located in Qingdao, China.\n         As a result of this decision, we recorded a non-cash charge of $882,000\n         that will be reflected in our results of operations for the three\n         months ended July 31, 2004.\n\n         As of July 31, 2004, the carrying amount of our investment in this\n         joint venture was approximately $1.1 million. We account for our\n         interest in this joint venture based on the equity method and recorded\n         a loss on the joint venture of approximately $129,000 for the six\n         months ended July 31, 2004. This loss represents 39% of the total net\n         losses of $330,000 of the joint venture for the six months ended July\n         31, 2004 compared to a net profit for the joint venture of $167,000 for\n         the six months ended July 31, 2003.\n\n         Our joint venture partner has advised us that, based on the factory's\n         current operations, the joint venture may continue to generate losses\n         for the foreseeable future. A review of the operations of the factory\n         is being undertaken by management of the joint venture to determine\n         whether cost cutting measures or other operating efficiencies could\n         return the factory to profitability. There are no assurances that this\n         review will result in future profits for the joint venture.\n\n         Based upon the prospect of the factory continuing to generate losses,\n         we believe that the best course of action for us is to attempt to sell\n         our interest in the joint venture. We believe this decision will also\n         provide us with more flexibility by allowing us to outsource all of our\n         manufacturing. Our estimate of the charge represents the difference\n         between our investment in the joint venture as of July 31, 2004 and the\n         estimated proceeds we would receive on sale of this joint venture\n         interest. We do not believe that this charge will result in future cash\n         expenditures.\n\n         We believe that we will be able to complete a sale of the joint venture\n         interest by January 31, 2005, the end of our current fiscal year.\n         However, there is no assurance that we will be able to complete this\n         sale by that date, if at all, or at the sale price we have estimated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", u'\n\n\n\n\nITEM 9.01.

ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2005 RESULTS\n\n\n         New York, New York - September 9, 2004 -- G-III Apparel Group, Ltd.\n(Nasdaq: GIII) today announced operating results for the second quarter of\nfiscal 2005.\n\n         For the three-month period ended July 31, 2004, G-III reported net\nsales of $43.9 million and a net loss of $1.7 million, or $0.23 per share,\ncompared to net sales of $45.3 million and net income of $2.7 million, or $0.37\nper diluted share, during the comparable period last year. For the six-month\nperiod ended July 31, 2004, G-III reported net sales of $60.4 million and a net\nloss of $6.5 million, or $0.91 per share, compared to net sales of $64.0 million\nand net income of $91,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, during the comparable\nperiod last year.\n\n         The current three and six month periods include a non-cash charge of\n$882,000, equal to $0.12 per share, associated with the Company\'s decision to\nattempt to sell its joint venture interest in a factory in China. The amount of\nthe charge represents the difference between the Company\'s current investment of\n$1.1 million in the joint venture and the estimated proceeds it would receive on\nsale of this joint venture interest.\n\n         Mr. Goldfarb, G-III\'s Chief Executive Officer, said, "The decision to\nsell our share of our 39% joint venture interest in our manufacturing facility\nin China is primarily due to current losses and the expectation of continuing\nlosses for the foreseeable future. We believe this will also provide us with\nmore flexibilty by allowing us to outsource all of our production. It is our\nintention to continue to contract with this facility as a key resource."\n\n         Morris Goldfarb continued, "While our second quarter results continued\nto be challenged by a sharp reduction in our higher margin fashion sports\nbusiness, they were in line with our plan. Based on good rates of order growth,\na strong consumer appetite for fashion and positive preliminary feedback with\nrespect to our fall lines, we believe that we are positioned for a solid second\nhalf. While our full year results will not reach last year\'s level as a result\nof the losses in the first half, we expect to see profit growth in the second\nhalf of the year as compared\n\n', u'\n\n\n\nto last year. Our focus will continue to be on creating compelling product that\noffers value to consumers, executing well, maintaining strong customer\nrelationships, and seeking new growth opportunities across our portfolio of\nbusinesses. We continue to benefit from a position as one of the world\'s largest\nand highest quality outerwear manufacturers and believe that this will lead to\nopportunities for growth, diversification, and value for our shareholders."\n\n         Also today, G-III Apparel Group issued guidance for the fiscal year\nending January 31, 2005. For the fiscal year, the Company is forecasting net\nsales of approximately $215 million and diluted net income per share between\n$0.38 and $0.43. This forecast includes the effects of the previously discussed\ncharge of $882,000, equal to $0.12 per share.\n\n\nABOUT G-III APPAREL GROUP, LTD.\n\n         G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. is a leading manufacturer and distributor of\nouterwear and sportswear under licensed labels, our own labels and private\nlabels.
