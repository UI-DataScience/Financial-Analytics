As a result the company has been able to select the best\npersonnel.\n\nMarine Cargo Recovery and its parent (hereinafter "MCR") own recovery and survey\nequipment and also have access to historical artefacts that can make for highly\nunique and successful exhibitions, as well as artefacts that are useful for\nsecuritisation purposes.\n\nMCR has predominantly concentrated on the waters of South East Asia, Middle East\nand the North Sea. Presently MCR is involved in marine recovery projects in the\nNorth Sea, South Africa, Middle East and Indonesia. This geographical spread has\nbeen chosen to maximise the opportunities open to the company in terms of known\nwreck projects and to spread political and geographic risk. The management are\naware of the dangers of dispersion of effort but wish to retain options in\nrelation to the above risks and to weather constraints.\n\nMCR has the rights to an exclusive license for survey and cargo recovery\nthroughout the territorial waters of the Yemen, which for 2000 years have been a\nmajor trade route between east and west. All of the above will enhance the share\nprice of the listed vehicle.\n\nMCR owns a number of White Star Line artefacts (the company that owned Titanic),\nand owns the merchandising material in relation to the Tek Sing find including\nbooks, videos, music CD\'s and facsimile materials. These all add to MCR\'s\nability to generate income and drive the company share price.\n\n\n\n                                  Page 1 of 4\n', u"\n\nLICENSES AND CONTRACTS\n\nWith the rare exception of the waters of the Yemen Republic, which has a\nterritorial exclusivity to the salvor built into the contract (see below),\naccess to wrecks in other areas is open to all. However, only those companies\nwhich can bring together a competent management team, strong research, technical\nexpertise and adequate funding can in reality access these wrecks. It would\nappear that at the present time that the only company able to unite these\npre-requisites is MCR.\n\nYEMEN. An exclusive license is in place to work throughout the territorial\nwaters of the Yemen Republic. This includes the whole of the Indian Ocean coast\nfrom the Omani/Yemeni border to the entrance to the Red Sea, including the\nisland of Socotra, plus the Red Sea waters from the entrance in the south to\nthe Saudi border in the north, with all the Red Sea islands in this area. Such\nan exclusive licence being awarded to a salvage company is extremely rate and is\nperhaps unique at the present time.\n\nThe government will receive from 10% to a fixed maximum of 40% of artefact and\ncargo sales revenues, according to a sliding scale culminating in 40% once a\ncumulative total of $50 million of sales revenues has been achieved. According\nto the Contract all artefacts and recoveries have to be exported from the Yemen\nto, preferably, London, for sale through the appropriate professional outlets.\nSales and marketing can commence as soon as the recoveries are landed at the\nappropriate destination. It is anticipated that a reasonable amount of the\nrecoveries will be sold at auction, the rest sold directly or held for\nsecuritisation purposes.\n\nYemen has been an important trading route between East and West for over 2000\nyears and initial finds here confirm the enormous potential in rare and valuable\nartefacts.\n\nINDONESIA. Management of MCR is known to senior officials within the departments\nin Indonesia which are responsible for wreck survey and salvage and has been\ninvited to apply for survey and salvage permits within their waters. The\nregulations pertaining to such permits are will known to Management who intend\nto take up such licences when appropriate.\n\nIn addition, the governor of Belitung Island (between Banka Island and Borneo)\nhas asked Management to help his administration to manage the large stocks of\nwrecks, including tin cargo wrecks, that are known to exist within Belitung's 12\nmile limit.\n\n\n\n                                  Page 2 of 4\n", u'\n\n\nTHE UK\n\nTHE DEUTSCHLAND Admiralty Droit No: 269/01. The wreck of this German liner is\nlocated in the southern part of the North Sea in international waters, resting\non the Kentish Knock Sands. Her position is roughly 23 miles from Harwich in one\ndirection and 22 miles from Margate in the other.\n\nThe wreck itself is of iron construction and is now in three pieces. It needs to\nbe cut open to expose the cargo inside. The scattered cargo outside the vessel\nhas been recovered.\n\nExploratory work recently carried out by MCR indicates the cargo included\nporcelain dolls, other items of porcelain, ornamental glassware that is still\nintact and musical instruments.\n\nOTHER AREAS\n\nTHE BREDERODE on her maiden voyage to and from the East, is one of the homeward\nbound disasters that took place during 1785 of the Cape Agulhas coast of South\nAfrica. The cargo manifest states that the ship was carrying a valuable cargo of\ntea, silk and linen cloths, spices, and porcelain, tin and gold. The site was\ndiscovered by Aqua Exploration in 1991 and identified by the combined efforts of\nAqua Exploration and Hallstrom Holdings.\n\nA legal contract has been drawn up between Charles Shapiro (Aqua Exploration),\nthe South African Maritime Museum (SAMM) and the National Monuments Council\n(NMC). This ensures that there will be "no missing links" as far as the\narchaeology aspect of the ship is concerned and that the salvor can expect to\nreceive approximately 95% of her valuable cargo.\n\nWORK IN PROGRESS\n\nMCR has found a number of wrecks in the North Sea that will be excavated this\ncoming season. Their cargoes consist of gold coin, blue and white porcelain and\nvaluable artefact recoveries.\n\n\n\n                                  Page 3 of 4\n', u"\n\n\nIn Yemen, the company has found two antique wrecks. One is a Roman era wreck\ndated to about the time of Christ and the other has been dated to the 10th\ncentury. Both these finds offer the opportunity of early salvage and recoveries\nwhich will have a considerable media impact.\n\nIn addition, the company has found evidence of the existence (through many\nrecovered items) of an exceptionally rare and valuable 14th century Chinese\nporcelain cargo in the Red Sea. A major international auction house has invested\nin the first survey expedition and confirms the huge value and importance of the\ncargo. The completion of the survey to locate the wreck is a priority for the\ncompany's activities in Yemen and should have an early and positive impact on\nthe company's value.\n\nWORK PROGRAMME\n\nManagement have selected a limited number of wrecks from a large number of\npotentially important ships which are known to them and for which there exist\nsubstantial research data. These wrecks which are to be included in the first\nsurvey and salvage projects that the company undertakes, are indicated in the\nbudget in terms of cost and potential revenue.
