A copy of the press\nrelease is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.\n\nITEM 8.01  OTHER EVENTS\n\n        On August 25, 2004, the Company issued a press release announcing its\nfinancial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2004. As reported therein, the\nCompany committed to a restructuring plan involving certain subsidiaries of its\nFlight Support Group that provide repair and overhaul services ("repair and\noverhaul subsidiaries") during the third quarter of fiscal 2004. The\nrestructuring plan calls for inventory write-downs, contract termination costs,\nmanagement hiring/relocation related expenses, and other associated costs. The\nunexpected death of an executive of certain of the repair and overhaul\nsubsidiaries was the impetus for the commencement of the restructuring\nactivities, which the Company believes will allow it to better service its\ncustomers and improve operating margins.\n\n        The Company incurred $600,000 of restructuring expenses in its third\nquarter of fiscal 2004 ended July 31, 2004. The restructuring expenses included\n$350,000 of inventory write-downs (non-cash amount) and a $250,000 accrual for\nmanagement hiring/relocation related expenses. The inventory written down is\nrelated to older generation aircraft for which repair and overhaul services are\nbeing discontinued by the Company.\n\n        The Company estimates it will incur an additional $400,000 - $600,000 of\nrestructuring expenses relating to contract termination costs, management\nhiring/relocation related expenses and other associated costs over the fourth\nquarter of fiscal 2004 and first quarter of fiscal 2005. The contract\ntermination costs expected to be incurred, including lease termination on a\nfacility, are estimated to total $250,000 - $300,000. Additional costs expected\nto be incurred principally consist of moving costs related to the consolidation\nof two repair and overhaul facilities and one-time employee termination/hiring\nbenefits, which are estimated to aggregate approximately $150,000 - $300,000.\n\n        The aggregate total amount of expenses to be incurred in connection with\nthe restructuring plan is $1.0 million to $1.2 million of which $650,000 -\n$850,000 represents future cash expenditures.\n\nITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS\n\n        (C) EXHIBITS\n\n        EXHIBIT NO.

For the\nfirst nine months of fiscal 2004, net income increased 78% to $15,464,000, or 60\ncents per diluted share, from $8,682,000, or 36 cents per diluted share, in the\nfirst nine months of fiscal 2003.\n\n(NOTE: HEICO has two classes of common stock traded on the NYSE. Both classes,\nthe Class A Common Stock (HEI.A) and the Common Stock (HEI), are virtually\nidentical in all economic respects. The only difference between the share\nclasses is the voting rights. The Class A Common Stock (HEI.A) receives 1/10\nvote per share and the Common Stock (HEI) receives one vote per share.)\n\nOperating income increased 29% to $7,870,000 for the third quarter of fiscal\n2004 from $6,101,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 and increased 37% to\n$22,615,000 for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 from $16,561,000 for the\nfirst nine months of fiscal 2003.\n\nNet sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 were up 23% to $55,820,000 from\n$45,412,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. Net sales increased 20% to\n$154,764,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2004 from $128,791,000 in the\nfirst nine months of fiscal 2003.\n\nNet income for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2004\nincludes $4.0 million in proceeds (net of the minority interest's share of the\nincome) from a key-person life insurance policy maintained by a subsidiary of\nthe Company's Flight Support Group. In the attached Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Operations, the life insurance proceeds are excluded from the\ncomputation of operating income and reported after operating income.

The net impact of the life\ninsurance proceeds reduced by the restructuring expenses and litigation-related\nexpenses increased net income by $3.6 million, or $.14 per diluted share, for\nthe third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2004.\n\nCash flow from operating activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2004\nincreased 80% to $32.6 million, including $5.0 million from the life insurance\nproceeds, from $18.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2003 and equaled\n211% of the Company\'s net income. Capital expenditures totaled $3.4 million in\nthe first nine months of fiscal 2004.\n\nLaurans A. Mendelson, HEICO\'s Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer,\nremarked, "Based on our operating results through the third quarter and current\nmarket conditions, we are raising our fiscal 2004 sales growth target to 20%\nover fiscal 2003 and increasing our diluted earnings per share target to a range\nof $.78 - $.80, which would represent a significant increase of over 50% from\nfiscal 2003 per share results. Fiscal 2004 cash flow from operating activities\nshould approximate $39 - $40 million, which would represent an $11 - $12 million\nincrease over fiscal 2003. Capital expenditures should total $5 - $6 million in\nfiscal 2004.\n\nWe are pleased to report both increased sales and improved margins in each of\nour business segments and our PMA aftermarket sales reached an all time\nquarterly high in the third quarter. This reflects both organic growth, which\napproximated 15% in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 over the third quarter of\nfiscal 2003, and growth through acquiring profitable, well-managed businesses.\nWe also believe that our ongoing new product development efforts and strategic\nrelationships with some of the world\'s major airlines continue to contribute to\nthe improved operating results within the Flight Support Group where sales have\nexceeded our internal targets.\n\nOperating margins within our Flight Support Group continue to show\nyear-over-year improvement despite the restructuring expenses incurred in the\nthird quarter of fiscal 2004. We believe these restructuring efforts, which\ninclude consolidation of two West Coast repair and overhaul facilities and\nrelated management hiring and relocation expenses, will allow us to better serve\nour customers while further improving operating margins.\n\nAs we continue to add new products and further penetrate our markets, we expect\nthe Flight Support Group\'s operating margins in the fourth quarter of fiscal\n2004 to continue to show year-over-year improvement, while maintaining strong\noperating margins in the Electronic Technologies Group.\n\nWe are also pleased to note continued very strong cash flow. Cash flow from\noperating activities in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 totaled $15.9 million,\nallowing us to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility by $8.0\nmillion in the quarter while increasing cash and cash equivalent investments by\n$4.8 million.\n\n                                    - more -\n\n', u'\n\nAs we look to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, fiscal 2005 and beyond, we\nbelieve we have established a strong foundation for long-term growth in sales\nand earnings. With both traffic and capacity growing within the commercial\nairline industry, our focus on new product development in both our business\nsegments and our strong balance sheet, HEICO is poised for continued strong\ngrowth."\n\nAll per share and share information in this release has been adjusted\nretroactively to give effect to a 10% stock dividend paid in January 2004.\n\nThe 29% increase in operating income for the third quarter and the 37% increase\nin operating income for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 over the comparable\nperiods of fiscal 2003 reflect increased sales and higher margins within each of\nthe Company\'s two operating segments, the Flight Support Group (FSG) and the\nElectronic Technologies Group (ETG).\n\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2004, sales of the FSG increased 22% to\n$40,086,000 from $32,742,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2003. For the first\nnine months of fiscal 2004, sales of the FSG increased 18% to $112,053,000 from\n$95,004,000 for the first nine months of fiscal 2003. The increase in revenues\nfor the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2004 versus the respective\nfiscal 2003 periods resulted primarily from improved demand for the Company\'s\nreplacement parts and repair and overhaul services, which reflects continuing\nrecovery in the commercial airline industry, as well as increased sales of new\nproducts.\n\nOperating income of the FSG increased 25% to $6,006,000 for the third quarter of\nfiscal 2004 from $4,797,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 and increased\n21% to $17,344,000 for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 from $14,336,000 for\nthe first nine months of fiscal 2003. The increase in operating income for the\nthird quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2004 reflects the higher sales\nand improved margins within the FSG.\n\nSales of the ETG increased 23% to $15,743,000 for the third quarter of fiscal\n2004 from $12,814,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 and increased 26% to\n$42,825,000 for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 from $34,102,000 for the\nfirst nine months of fiscal 2003. The increase in sales for the third quarter\nand the first nine months of fiscal 2004 is primarily due to the acquisition of\nSierra Microwave Technology in December 2003.\n\nOperating income of the ETG increased 27% to $3,428,000 for the third quarter of\nfiscal 2004 from $2,702,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 and increased\n79% to $9,615,000 for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 from $5,374,000 for\nthe first nine months of fiscal 2003. The increase in operating income for the\nthird quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2004 reflects the acquisition\nof Sierra.\n\nThere are currently approximately 14.3 million shares of HEICO\'s Class A Common\nStock (HEI.A) outstanding and 9.9 million shares of HEICO\'s Common Stock (HEI)\noutstanding.
