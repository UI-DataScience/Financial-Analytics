This represents an increase of 35% in revenues and\na decrease  in the net loss of 37% from  fiscal  2003 to\nfiscal 2004.\n\nMost   significantly,   revenues   attributable  to  the\nCompany\'s  medical equipment segment increased by 62% to\n$48.6  million  in fiscal  2004 from  $30.0  million  in\nfiscal  2003.  Revenues  from  product  sales  more than\ndoubled,  increasing by 72% from $24.9 million in fiscal\n2003  to  $43.0   million  in  fiscal  2004.   This  was\nattributable  to the increase in scanner sales  revenues\nfor the Company\'s Stand-Up(TM) MRI from $24.9 million to\n$43.0 million.  The Company\'s backlog of unfilled orders\nat July 1,  2004 was  approximately  $40.7  million,  as\ncompared to $26.8 million at July 1, 2003.\n\nFor    more    information    and   a   chart   go   to:\nwww.FONAR.com/news/091604.htm\n\nConfirming  the  Company\'s   expectations  of  increased\ndemand  for its  scanners,  product  sales to  unrelated\nparties more than  doubled,  by 113% in fiscal 2004 from\n$17.7  million in fiscal 2003 to $37.7 million in fiscal\n2004.  Product sales to related parties decreased 27% in\nfiscal  2004 from $7.3  million  in fiscal  2003 to $5.3\nmillion  in  fiscal  2004.Revenues  attributable  to the\nCompany\'s  physician and diagnostic  services management\nsegment  (HMCA),  reversed  their  decline,   increasing\nslightly  by 0.2% to $23.0  million in fiscal  2004 from\n$22.9  million in fiscal 2003,  reflecting  increases in\nMRI scan volume at certain MRI facilities  equipped with\nStand-Up(TM) MRI\'s. HMCA now manages four MRI facilities\nwith Stand-Up(TM) MRI scanners. The first three, located\nin Islandia,  Staten Island and  Bensonhurst,  New York,\nproduced $1.6 million in operating income for HMCA. HMCA\nrecently  installed  a  Stand-Up(TM)  MRI in Boca Raton,\nFlorida  to  replace  the   existing   MRI  facility  in\nDeerfield Beach, Florida.\n\nThe Company\'s consolidated operating loss decreased,  by\n44% to $8.5  million  for fiscal  2004 as compared to an\noperating  loss of $15.1  million for fiscal  2003.  The\nCompany\'s   cash,   cash   equivalents   and  marketable\nsecurities increased by 36% to $20.6 million at June 30,\n2004 from $15.2 at June 30,  2003.  All  current  assets\nincreased  by 54% from $35.7  million in fiscal  2003 to\n$55.1 million in fiscal 2004 while  current  liabilities\nincreased by 46%,  from $22.2  million in fiscal 2003 to\n$32.5   million  in  fiscal  2004.   Consequently,   the\nCompany\'s  working capital surplus,  which is a positive\ndifference    between   current   assets   and   current\nliabilities,  increased  by 67% from  $13.5  million  in\nfiscal 2003 to $22.6 million.\n\nHigh gross profit margins on product sales  continued to\nincrease: 38% for fiscal 2004 compared to 36% for fiscal\n2003. We attribute these trends to the continuing growth\nof our MRI product sales,  particularly our Stand-Up(TM)\nMRI scanners and the  increased  efficiencies  resulting\nfrom our higher sales volumes.\n\nOrders for 39  Stand-Up(TM)  MRI scanners  were received\nduring   fiscal  2004  as  compared  to  orders  for  22\nStand-Up(TM)    MRI   scanners   during   fiscal   2003,\nrepresenting an increase in orders of 77%.\n\nRaymond  Damadian,  president and chairman said,  "We\'re\npleased at the results of our efforts to upgrade the MRI\nfacilities.  The first three of HMCA\'s  Stand-Up(TM) MRI\nupgrades are working well,  contributing $1.6 million in\noperating  income to HMCA for fiscal 2004.  In addition,\nwe have recently  completed the installation of a fourth\nStand-Up(TM) MRI, in Boca Raton Florida. We are planning\nto open two new sites  with  Stand-Up(TM)  MRI  scanners\nwithin the next 12 months,  which  would bring the total\nnumber of facilities with  Stand-Up(TM)  MRI scanners we\nmanage to six."\n\n   CONDENSED  CONSOLIDATED  STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS\n\n                             Fiscal 2004    Fiscal 2003\n                             -----------    ------------\nRevenues                     $71,609,000    $52,892,000\nNet Loss From Continuing\nOperations                    (9,494,000)   (15,201,000)\nNet  Gain (Loss) -\n  Discontinued Operations           -           195,000\nNet Loss                      (9,494,000)   (15,006,000)\nBasic & Diluted Net\n  Loss/Share  Continuing\n  Operations                       (0.10)         (0.20)\nBasic & Diluted Net Loss/Share\nDiscontinued Operations              -              -\nBasic & Diluted  Net Loss/Share    (0.10)         (0.20)\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------\n MRI Specialist, Stand-Up, Upright, Position, pMRI and\n  The Proof is in the Picture are trademarks of FONAR.\n\n  Be sure to visit FONAR\'s Web site for Company product\n                and investor information:\n                      www.fonar.com\n\nThis release may include forward-looking statements from\nthe company that may or may not materialize.
