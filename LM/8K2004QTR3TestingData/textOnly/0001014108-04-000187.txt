At the time of  acquisition,  the Devon  assets  were  producing  an\naverage of  approximately  19,600 gross mcf per day.

Total\nRevenues and Operating Income for fiscal 2004 were approximately  $30.0 million,\nand $9.5 million,  respectively.  These are substantial increases over the Total\nRevenues of  approximately  $8.1 million and Operating  Income of  approximately\n$2.4 million for Fiscal 2003.\n\nProven Reserves\n\nNet proven reserves of approximately 133.6 million mcfe for Fiscal 2004 exceeded\nnet proven  reserves of  approximately  28.3 million mcfe for 2003 by 372%.  The\nproven  reserve  estimates  were prepared by the petroleum  engineering  firm of\nCawley,  Gillespie,  and  Associates,  Inc.  of Ft.  Worth,  TX. The 2004 proven\nreserve  estimate  places a present value of the future net cash flow discounted\nat 10% at approximately $318.4 million.\n\n\n\n", u"\n\n\nManagement Comments\n\nThe significant  increase in net production and net proven reserves  reflect the\nmagnitude of growth  accomplished by Quest through its strategic  acquisition of\nDevon's Cherokee Basin producing wells and pipeline network,  and the aggressive\nnew well drilling and completion  program that is still active.  The Company has\naccelerated  its  development  plans by  establishing  a new well  drilling  and\ncompletion target of 1,140 wells for the next three years.  Management  believes\nthat Quest has the experienced  employee base and development assets in place to\naccomplish this increased pace of development.\n\nQuest's primary activity is the exploration,  production,  and transportation of\nnatural  gas  in  a  1,000  square  mile  region  of  southeastern   Kansas  and\nnortheastern  Oklahoma that is served by its 900 mile gas pipeline network.
