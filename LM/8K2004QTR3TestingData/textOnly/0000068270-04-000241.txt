The Company\nestimates that same-store sales were negatively affected by approximately 0.3% at domestic\nfranchise restaurants and 0.4% at Company-owned restaurants as a result of the Labor Day\nweekend being included in the first quarter in fiscal 2004, while in fiscal 2005 Labor Day\nweekend will be included in the second quarter. The Company now anticipates approximately\n19% diluted earnings per share growth for the first quarter of fiscal 2005, compared to\nthe 22% growth the Company had originally projected. While Company-owned same-store sales\nwere less than originally projected, the Company\x92s share of franchising income was\nhigher than anticipated as a result of their same-store sales performance.

It\nappears that, during the quarter, the consumer felt some strain as we overlapped the tax\nstimulus packages from the prior year at a time of higher gas prices and interest costs,\nand continued economic uncertainty. Regarding factors we can control, we made a conscious\ndecision to reduce menu prices, and had no media presence during the quarter. On August\n31', u'st', u', we rolled out our Fall menu, which includes some exciting new items and\noffers even better value, and we improved our focus on both our salad bar and alcohol\nprograms. We are in a difficult sales environment, but we believe our operations, people,\nfacilities and price/value proposition are in the best shape ever.
