And good day and welcome to the\nNike first quarter 2005 earnings conference call.  Today\'s call is being\nrecorded.\n\nAt this time for opening remarks and introductions, I will be turning\nthe call over to Ms. Pamela Catlett, Vice President of Investor\nRelations.  Ms. Catlett, please go ahead.\n\nPamela Catlett:  Thank you, good morning everyone.  We\'re pleased you\'re\njoining us this morning to discuss Nike\'s fiscal 2005 first quarter\nresults.  We\'re reporting to you today from the Oregon Convention Center\nwhere we\'ll host our annual meeting of shareholders later this morning.\n\nFor those of you who need to reference our release you\'ll find it on our\nWeb site, www.nikebiz.com.  You\'ll also find expanded information on the\nWeb site about some of the highlights we\'ll be discussing today.\n\nParticipants in today\'s call are Charlie Denson and Mark Parker,\nPresidents of the Nike Brand; and Don Blair, Nike\'s Chief Financial\nOfficer.\n\nEach of today\'s participants will provide brief prepared remarks, which\nwill also be available on our Web site immediately following the call.\n\nBefore I turn it over to Don, I\'d like to remind you that on this call,\nwe\'re going to make forward-looking statements based on our current\nexpectations.  And those statements are subject to certain risks and\nuncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nThese risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports we filed with\nthe SEC including Forms 8-K and 10-Q.  Some forward-looking statements\nconcerns future orders that are not necessarily indicative of total\nrevenues for subsequent periods due to cancellations and a mix of\nfutures and at once orders, which may vary significant from quarter-to-\nquarter.\n\nIn addition, it\'s important to remember a significant portion of our\nbusiness including equipment, most of Nike retail, Nike golf, Converse,\nCole Haan, Bauer and Hurley are not included in these futures numbers.\n\nFinally, during this conference call we may discuss non GAAP financial\nmeasures.  The presentation of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative\nreconciliations can also be found at Nike\'s Web site.\n\nIn this call, we may also discuss non-public financial and statistical\ninformation, which is also available on our site.\n\nNow, here\'s Don.\n\nDon Blair:  Thanks, Pam.  Our business momentum continued in the first\nquarter of fiscal 2005 as virtually every component of our global\nbusiness portfolio performed well in the quarter.  Our revenues grew 18\npercent for the quarter, to a record $3.6 billion.  Changes in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates accounted for about three points of growth,\nwhile the acquisition of Converse added another four points to\nconsolidated revenue growth for the quarter.  The impact of the Starter\nacquisition on our quarterly results was negligible.\n\nWe also delivered record profits in the first quarter, as our diluted\nearnings per share were $1.21 up 23 percent versus fiscal 2004.  The\nacquisition of Converse accounted for about nine points of our\nconsolidated earnings per share growth.  For the quarter, our\nconsolidated gross margin was 44-and-a-half percent, up 1.5 points\nversus last year\'s first quarter.  Currency changes accounted for about\n1.3 points of the improvement.  As we expected our SG&A spending was\nfairly heavy in the quarter, largely as a result of demand creation\ninvestments around the summer\'s global sporting events.  Futures orders\nfor the next five months grew about 10 percent in real dollar terms.\n\nExcluding the impact of currency changes, futures orders increased 9.2\npercent, essentially inline with the growth we reported last quarter.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2005, we also continued to manage our\nshareholder\'s capital effectively.  Our return on invested capital was\n22 percent.  And we delivered $308 million of free cash flow from\noperations.  I should note, that since free cash flow from operations is\na non GAAP term, we\'ve posted the reconciliation on our Web site.\n\nWe also delivered a lot of cash to shareholders during the quarter.  We\nrepurchased $155 million of our own stock, and we paid out $53 million\nin dividends.  So those are the headlines.  Now let\'s dig in to some of\nthe details.\n\nIn our European region which includes the Middle East and Africa,\nrevenues grew 14 percent in Q1 with about five points of the growth\ncoming from more favorable exchange rates.  Footwear revenues grew 12\npercent, apparel revenues advanced 20 percent, and equipment revenues\nwere up seven percent.  Revenue for the quarter was somewhat better than\nwe expected, as some orders that would normally have been delivered in\nSeptember moved into August.\n\nFootwear revenue growth for the quarter benefited from strong sales in\nthe U.K., Italy, and the emerging markets of central Europe, Turkey,\nRussia and Greece, partially offset by weaker results in France,\nGermany and Iberia.  As a result of the timing issues I mentioned\nearlier, we\'re not ready to call a change in our footwear revenue trend\nyet, from the low to mid single digit constant dollar growth rate we\'ve\nseen over the last few quarters.\n\nEuropean apparel sales also benefited from the summer sporting events,\nas well as new kit launches for Arsenal and Manchester United.  Our\ngross margins in Europe expanded 180 basis points for the quarter,\naccounting for 60 basis points of our consolidated margin improvement.\nAs we indicated earlier, in fiscal 2005, we will be investing in the\nproduct value equation in Europe, partially offsetting the gross margin\nbenefits of better foreign exchange rates.\n\nReported first quarter pretax income for the European region was $246\nmillion, an increase of 21 percent versus fiscal 2004.  In the Asia\nPacific region, revenues increased 17 percent in the first quarter.\nAbout five points of the increase came from stronger currencies in the\nregion.  Footwear reported eight percent growth, while apparel grew 31\npercent, and equipment advanced 21 percent.  Revenues in China nearly\ndoubled, while Japan posted another quarter of double digit growth.\n\nFor the quarter, Asia Pacific gross margin advanced 230 basis points,\naccounting for 30 basis points of the consolidated gross margin\nimprovement.  Reported pre tax income for the quarter, fell 17 percent\nto $63 million, as SG&A spending increased over 50 percent as we had\nplanned.\n\nInvestments and demand creation for the Olympics in China, as well as\nthe implementation of new supply chain systems in Japan and Southeast\nAsia drove the year-over-year increase in SG&A.  The America\'s region\nperformed pretty much as expected in the first quarter.  Local currency\nrevenues grew 10 percent in the quarter, but weaker currencies in the\nregion reduced reported revenue growth to seven percent.  Gross margin\nfell 170 basis points in the quarter, reducing Nike Inc, consolidated\ngross margins by about 10 basis points.  Lower gross margins combined\nwith heavy demand creation investments drove reported pre tax income to\n$21 million for the quarter, down 15 percent versus the prior year.\n\nIn the U.S., we began fiscal 2005 with a banner quarter, as revenues\nadvanced over 12 percent, driven by strong growth across a number of\nwholesale accounts.  Footwear revenues grew 12 percent, apparel\nincreased 13 percent, and equipment grew 11 percent.  Comparable store\nsales for Niketown stores grew nine percent in the first quarter,\nreflecting the strength of the brand.  And U.S. futures orders rose over\n11 percent versus the year ago period.\n\nGross margins in the U.S. advanced 50 basis points for the quarter,\ndriving 20 basis points of our consolidated gross margin improvement.\nMost of the improvement came from footwear through a combination of\ninline margins and fewer, more profitable close-outs.  Higher revenues\nand gross margins were partially offset by heavier demand creation\ninvestments in the U.S., bringing pre tax reported profits to $322\nmillion, up 10 percent versus last year\'s quarter.  Operating overhead\nin the U.S. region grew less than three percent.\n\nFor the quarter, revenues from our other businesses grew 64 percent, to\n$435 million.  The acquisition of Converse accounted for about three-\nquarters of that growth.  Cole Haan had another stellar quarter, as\nrevenues advanced 30 percent.  Our other businesses earned $40 million\nof pretax profit driven primarily by the acquisition of Converse, and\nrobust profit growth at Cole Haan.\n\nConsolidated SG&A spending for Nike, Inc, grew 23 percent in the\nquarter, driven by a 44 percent increase in demand creation and an 11\npercent increase in operating overhead.  For total SG&A, changes in\nexchange rates accounted for two points of that growth.  And the\naddition of Converse accounted for about three points of the increase.\nThe increase in demand creation spending was the expected result of our\ninvestments in advertising behind the summer\'s global sporting events,\nhigher endorsement expenses, and retail development programs.  In\naddition to the impacts of foreign exchange and the Converse\nacquisition, the increase in operating overhead reflected investments in\nNike retail stores and in Asia, including the supply chain system\'s\nimplementation in Japan and Southeast Asia.\n\nOther expense for the first quarter was $2 million, down $24 million in\nthe prior year.  The largest factor in the improvement was lower foreign\ncurrency losses primarily from hedging.  The net effect of the\nimprovement in foreign currency losses and the favorable translation of\nforeign currency denominated profits was $22 million of additional\npretax income for the quarter.\n\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.4 percent, consistent with\nour current estimate for the full year.  This rate is 60 basis points\nabove the rate for all of last year, due largely to the expiration of\nR&D tax credit legislation.  The strength of our balance sheet continued\nto be a highlight at the end of the first quarter as well.  Our balance\nof cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $1.3\nbillion, well in excess of debt balances.\n\nAs of August 31st, worldwide inventories were 11 percent higher than a\nyear ago.  The acquisition of Converse and currency changes together\naccounted for about seven points of growth.  Inventory in the U.S. fell\nnine percent.  At the end of the quarter, accounts receivable were six\npercent higher than the prior year.  Stronger foreign currencies and\nthe acquisition of Converse together accounted for all of that growth.\n\nOur expectations for fiscal 2005 remain broadly consistent with the\npoint of view we discussed last quarter.  We\'re targeting high single\ndigit revenue growth for the full year, as we\'ve now passed the\nanniversary of the Converse acquisition and we will begin to compare\nagainst stronger numbers in the second half of fiscal 2004.\n\nAs we\'ve indicated earlier, we expect that better foreign exchange hedge\nrates will enable us to be more competitive in Europe and Asia, as well\nas grow our overall gross margin percentage for the year.  The increase\nin gross margin should be slightly greater in the second and third\nquarters when the year-over-year improvements in hedge rates will be\nmost significant.  The smallest year-over-year gross margin growth\nshould be in Q4, as we we\'re already experiencing better foreign\nexchange rates in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.\n\nWe\'re now planning SG&A spending for fiscal 2005 in the same range as\nlast year, which was just over 30 percent of revenue.  The high level of\nspending growth in the first quarter will be largely offset in the\nfourth quarter, due to the timing of demand creation spending.\n\nSo in summary we\'re very pleased with the quarter, and feel we\'re in a\ngreat position to deliver on our goals for the year.\n\nSo with that, I\'ll turn the floor over to Mr. Mark Parker, President of\nthe Nike brand.\n\nMark Parker:  Thanks, Don and good morning everyone.  For the past year,\nI\'ve been talking to you about the Nike speed initiative and the impact\nwe expected it would have on our business and our brand.  Now that we\'re\nwinding down on the summer of speed, and readying new campaigns this\nfall, I\'d like to take a quick look back on a few highlights.\n\nWe took the concept of Speed across sports, and regions, and spanned\nathletic events from Euro Champs to Copa America, the Tour de France,\nthe Olympics, and most recently the U.S. Open Tennis Tournament.  It was\nthe largest global integrated brand initiative in our history, involving\nmany of our top athletes including Lance Armstrong, Serena Williams,\nOlympic gold medalists like Hicham El Guerrouj and Justin Gatlin just\nto name a few.  And it features our most innovative footwear like the\nZoom Miler, and the Monsterfly, advanced apparel like the Swift\nSpin and Swift Suit, and design forward-equipment, like the MP3 Run.\nBy almost any metric, the campaign was a tremendous success, and has\ngiven the brand additional heat, and the business strong momentum as we\nmove further into the fiscal year.  Olympic years have always\nrepresented an excellent international platform and a positive boost for\nour business.  Since the Sidney games in 2000, Nike revenues have grown\n35 percent.\n\nBut our approach to the summer of 2004 was different from years past.\nInstead of focusing on one three-week period, we created a brand\ninitiative that spanned the entire summer.  Instead of focusing on one\ninternational competition, we wove the common theme of Speed through\nmajor sporting events in five continents.  And in addition to creating\ncutting-edge performance products for world class athletes, we brought\nto market both performance and performance-inspired training and active\nwear linked with these international sporting events.\n\nFor example, when El Guerrouj captured the gold in the 1500 and 5,000\nmeter races in the Nike Zoom Miler, not only was the innovative spike\navailable in running specialty shops for competitive runners, we also\nbrought Air Zoom Miler training shoes, and Street Miler active life\nshoes to broader retail distribution.\n\nWe\'ve seen solid sell through on the Air Zoom Miler and Street Miler\nfor both the men and women.  It\'s an example of the synergy we can\ncreate as we deliver solid performance product innovation, while driving\nour active life business.\n\nFrom an apparel standpoint, Nike Swift technology made an impressive\nshowing in a number of sports, including multi gold level performances\nin track and field, swimming, cycling and rowing.  But again, the bigger\nstory here is what we\'re bringing to apparel and to retail that\ndelivers the benefits of Swift technology, along with a distinctive\naesthetic to a broader market.  As Don reported, apparel revenues and\nreal dollars grew by 17 percent in quarter one, compared to quarter one\nlast year, results driven in part by the Summer of Speed, that not only\nfueled the business, but also the brand.\n\nYou could not have missed Serena Williams or her Nike designed outfit at\nthe U.S. Open featuring performance denim and cooling sphere and mesh\ndesigns.  In fact, Maria Sharapova, Lleyton Hewitt and Roger Federer\nalso wore Nike\'s most innovative tennis products, and the buzz\ngenerated on the court translated in to strong sales at retail.\n\nThrough Speed and other initiatives, we\'re aligning better than ever\nbehind our key athlete, team and federation partnerships to capitalize\non opportunities.  By creating comprehensive brand and product plans for\nour top partnerships, we are investing in the brand, and driving solid\nbusiness growth.  We\'re seeing growth and strength in our footwear\ncategories, such as running, basketball, soccer and training so our\nfoundation is strong.  I\'m very pleased to see a more balanced support\nportfolio with healthy sell-throughs across our sport and active life\ncategories.  In fact, we\'re seeing strong results across all major\nchannels of distribution for back-to-school.\n\nAs we expected, female consumers have embraced the new Shox for Her\nconcept and product.  NPD reported in July that the Nike Shox Energia\nwas a top training shoe in the industry.  And the Bella running shoe,\nand Allegria walking shoe also have very strong sell-throughs.\n\nNike Impax footwear is another back-to-school success story, popular\nwith consumers at a more accessible price point.  And then, finally, in\nfootwear, the Jordan brand continues to be strong in the sport, active\nand retro side of the business.\n\nOn the apparel side, branded athletic apparel has some strong momentum.\nWe\'re seeing rapidly increasing acceptance by consumers for performance\nfabrics like those used in the Nike Pro line, as well as Dri Fit\ntechnology in Nike Golf apparel.  Consumers also continue to embrace our\nSphere technology with innovative products such as the company\'s Sphere\nDry Woven jacket, and Sphere Dry Woven pant being two products in\nparticularly high demand this quarter.\n\nThese and other products contributed to an overall robust back-to-school\nseason for Nike that is driving healthy futures orders for Spring \'05.\nIn addition, I see continued momentum in the higher average price-per-\npair trend.  In the coming months, we\'ve capitalized on the brand heat\nwe generated during the Summer of Speed.  In the U.S. we\'re underway\nwith our fall football brand initiative that centers on Michael Vick\nand the much anticipated Air Zoom Vick II that we deliver to the\nmarket next week.\n\nOn the college front, roughly 80 percent of the top 25 college programs\nin the country, take to the field each Saturday in Nike Team Sports\nlicensed apparel.  And we continue to innovate with uniforms that are 25\npercent lighter with stronger fabrications and improved ventilation.\n\nIn Europe, soccer takes to the pitch once again in the European leagues\nas they heat up this fall.  Nike continues to build brand equity and\nTeam Sports apparel sales with the world\'s top clubs including\nManchester United, Juventus and Arsenal.  The launch of the integrated\nTotal 90 apparel collection is driving strong sales and retail impact in\nEurope and around the world.\n\nBefore I turn things over to Charlie Denson I\'d like to touch briefly on\nthe phenomenal worldwide reaction to the Wear Yellow campaign, featuring\nthe LiveStrong yellow wrist bands.  In late May Nike set out to honor\nLance Armstrong, not only a great athlete, but at the time going for his\nsixth win on the Tour de France.  But also, he is an inspiration to\nmillions who have overcome adversity.  As a celebration\nand a tribute to Lance, Nike donated one million to the Lance Armstrong\nFoundation and created the efforts to raise an additional $5 million to\nthe sale of $1 yellow wrist bands.  The wrist bands were stamped with\nLance\'s mantra "LiveStrong," now a global icon of support for those\nliving with cancer.  We\'re thrilled to report that over 12 million wrist\nbands have been sold to date.  Because of these fundraising efforts,\nthe Lance Armstrong Foundation continues in their pursuit of helping\ncancer survivors and their families LiveStrong.  The yellow wrist band\nhas become a cultural phenomenon generating tremendous public awareness\nfor Lance\'s foundation, and the excellent work it does.  And we\'re very\nproud to be involved with Lance, both on a professional and personal\nlevel.\n\nWith that, I\'ll turn it over to Charlie Denson.\n\nCharlie Denson:  Thanks, Mark.  And thank you all for joining us today.\nWell, if you\'ve heard we\'ve reported a strong first quarter performance.\nNot only is it a great start for our fiscal year, it\'s traditionally one\nof our larger quarters, and critical in delivering the targeted results\nwe\'ve talked about on an annual basis.\n\nFrom my perspective, today\'s results illustrated three vital components\nto our future success.  First, it reflects an ability to manage our\nportfolio, aligning and driving key components of our business,\nbalancing our strengths ad weaknesses, in order to deliver consistent\nrevenue and earnings growth over the long term.\n\nSecond, the things Mark has just reviewed, our ability to execution\nbrand building initiatives and brand management strategies in a very\ndiverse and complete global market place.  And third, our continued\ninvestment in both our core infrastructure and our future growth\nopportunities.\n\nFor the last nine months, we\'ve pointed towards what we\'ve\naffectionately called our Summer of Sport, speaking to both our global\nand regional plans for creating the connectivity between the brand and\nour consumer.  We\'ve talked about aligning all of our tools to achieve\noptimal results.  And now, we are seeing the benefits of plans well\nexecuted.  Overall, the portfolio performed very well.  Our USA business\nis a great example of that alignment really paying off.  From product,\nmarketing, retail and sales, the U.S. business is now hitting on all\ncylinders.  You see it in the numbers we\'re reporting, but you feel it\nfrom the energy and excitement consumers and customers are expressing\nfor our brand and indicated for our Futures numbers.\n\nEurope was another big benefactor of this summer\'s sporting events, with\na very strong first quarter performance.  We\'re still seeing some\nsoftness overall in the western European markets in our futures orders,\nprimarily from France and Germany.  We continue to invest aggressively\nin Asia, and feel very good about our growth and brand position\nthroughout the Asia Pacific region, and our business in South America\nremains stable.  We can also talk about diversity and the increasing\ncontribution by other parts of the portfolio, like Converse, and Cole\nHaan, with both companies turning in very strong quarterly performance.\n\n\nNike speed initiative is a global concept that has been executed in\nevery market in which we do business.  Brand efforts like this are major\ninvestments in the long-term health of the Nike brand, and are a great\nexample of brand building.  Mark filled you in on the details of its\nsuccess as a campaign, and we talked to you about it throughout fiscal\n2004.  We are also improving our ability to manage the brand and it\'s\nprofitability.  As most of you are aware, there is no quicker way to\ndamage or weaken a brand, than to over-inventory a market place,\ncompromising value and eroding consumer confidence.\n\nOur inventories continue to operate at healthy levels as we do a good\njob managing most of the marketplaces around the world.  We\'re seeing\nthe same for most retailers as well.  Profitability is back in vogue in\nthe athletic footwear and apparel industry.  Our ability to execute\nglobal concepts like Speed, are indicative of what we must continue to\ndo to increase our market share in the more developed markets and create\nmarket expansion in the emerging economies.  What separates us from our\ncompetition is our ability to execute a global initiative, as well as a\nlocally relevant one, like Euro Champs, the Tour de France, Copa\nAmerica, as well as a global event like the Olympics, all of these\nadding to the consumer relationships that we continue to build\nworldwide.\n\nMost of the time, when we talk about investments, we usually end up\nrecruiting our demand creation spending, or our supply chain spending,\nand justifiably so as they are substantial.  But we\'re investing in more\nthan just the high profile examples you\'re used to seeing from us.  I\'d\nlike to touch on a few other areas of investment that are helping us\ngenerate the sustainable performance that we\'ve been delivering.\n\nOne aspect of our investment strategy deals with the ever-changing\nretail environment, and our brand presence within it.  Over the past\nseveral years, we\'ve invested heavily to improve our location and\npresentation at retail.  Since 2001, we have installed hundreds of\ninline Nike presentations all over the world.  Some are corporate owned.\nSome are franchised.  But most are in partnerships with local retailers.\nThese investments have a significant impact on our concept\ncommunication, our brand and product messaging, the consumer experience,\nand ultimately our overall profitability.  We\'ve also strengthened our\nrelationships with retail partners, who\'s own business performance has\nbenefited from these investments.\n\nAs all of you know, we\'ve invested heavily in infrastructure, our supply\nchain, facilities and distributions.  All of these areas have been\nintegral in supporting our business model around the world.  Things like\nthe expansion of our European distribution center, warehouse, and\ndistribution facilities in Korea or Japan.  And of course, our IT\ninfrastructure that has taken a large piece of the risk out of\ndesigning, developing, and building a product line, that is recreated\nevery 90 days with over 10,000 new products.\n\nThe investments that were made in the last several years are now serving\nus well.  We will continue to invest in this infrastructure, to increase\nproductivity capabilities in our existing markets, as well as maintain\nour leadership position in new and emerging markets, places like China,\nRussia, Brazil and India.  These markets represent some of our growth\nengines in the future years.\n\nFinally, I\'d like to wrap up with a discussion of our growth portfolio\nof businesses and brands.  As you are all aware in August, we completed\nthe acquisition of Starter brands and formed a new subsidiary the\nExeter Brands Group.  The purpose of this acquisition in addition to\nthe incremental revenue and profit will allow us to expand our\ndistribution in to the value channel, a large and growing market, and\none in which we have not participated.  This addition to our portfolio\nenables us to gain experience in the value segment with an established\nand reputable brand name, and serves as a platform for further\ndevelopment of this space.  Starter is a perfect example of our\ncommitment to build and diversify our portfolio, by adding established\nleading brands in strategic market segments, while preserving the\nintegrity of Nike as a premium brand.\n\nIn fiscal year 2004, Converse, which we acquired just over a year ago,\nCole Haan, Hurley and Bauer, along with Nike Golf contributed $1.4\nbillion to our total Nike, Inc. revenues, and $75 million to our pretax\nincome.  For the first quarter of \'05, these businesses contributed 435\nmillion in revenue, a 64 percent increase from the first quarter of \'04,\nand $40 million in pre tax income.  The point is this group of brands is\ncollectively accounting for a more meaningful portion of our overall\nresults and is showing the potential to contribute significantly to our\nperformance in the coming years.\n\nWe were recently touted in a major U.S. business application as the "new\nNike" with a higher level of discipline.  It was a very positive article\nacknowledging some of our current successes, but I have to say I don\'t\nlike the word discipline, it sounds like punishment.  And maybe\nretrospectively we deserve to be categorized that way.  But I think it\'s\nmore than that.  It\'s a commitment to being a better company, a company\nwho\'s goal is to be considered one of the best managed companies in the\nworld, a company that is committed to its shareholders, it\'s employees,\nand the communities we all live in.  A company that realizes its only\njudge is the consumers who purchase our products.  And finally, a\ncompany that feels it can get better at all of the above.  If that\'s\nwhat you define as discipline so be it.  We like to think of it as the\nway we approach the business.\n\nSo as I conclude, I\'d just like to reiterate about how excited we are\nabout our continued momentum early on in fiscal 2005.  Over the\nremainder of the year, rest assured we will continue to reach consumers\nwith exciting, innovating products, and be part of many of the amazing\nathlete performances that are sure to come.  But most importantly, we\nwill continue to execute our strategies, invest with an eye on the\nfuture, and our profitable growth.  Thanks again for participating\ntoday.  Now we\'ll open it up to questions.\n\nOperator:  If you would like to ask a question, please press the star\nkey followed by the digit one on your touchtone telephone.  If you are\nusing a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off\nto allow your signal to reach our equipment.  Once again if you would\nlike to ask a question, please press star one at this time.  We\'ll pause\nfor just a moment to give everyone an opportunity to signal.\n\nOur first question comes from Virginia Genereux with Merrill Lynch.\n\nVirginia Genereux:  Thank you.  And Pam, are we - is it one or two\ntoday?\n\nPam Catlett:  Two. How about two today.\n\nVirginia Genereux:  All right.  Good.  Thank you.  First, if I may,\nConverse has obviously been just a great business for you guys, a\nstrong grower and very accretive this quarter.  Can you talk on maybe\nhow much bigger you guys think that business can get?  Is international\ndriving a lot of that as we look out a little bit here?\n\nDon Blair:  Well Virginia, you know that we don\'t give predictions on\nthat sort of thing, but your opening comment is absolutely on the money.\nWe\'re delighted with the performance we\'ve seen out of Converse so far.\nA lot of the growth is coming from international, but also a lot\ndomestically.  And as you probably know, most of the business outside of\nthe U.S. is actually a licensed business.  So we don\'t see a lot of the\nrevenue flow through on that.  We definitely see a bottom line flow\nthrough on it.  So we\'re growing both in the U.S. and internationally.\nWe are extremely excited about the prospects for Converse, but I\nwouldn\'t want to put a figure on that at this point.\n\nVirginia Genereux:  Thanks.  And then, secondly, if I may, you guys have\ndone a great job, always with this, but the U.S. business is going so\nwell.  Charlie, you talked a little bit, if maybe you can elaborate on\nhow do you sort of continue to control the distribution and the\ndifferentiation by retailer, to make sure that, I don\'t know, that the\nShox doesn\'t get too hot out there.  How do you guys do that nowadays,\nand how are the systems helping you?\n\nCharlie Denson:  Well I think, a couple of things Virginia, I think, one\nof the things that we\'ve been through over the last couple of years, and\nwe\'ve talked about it extensively is just our overall distribution\nstrategy in the U.S.  And I would say today, that we\'re probably as well\nbalanced across the U.S. in the different channels that we participate\nin as we\'ve been for quite some time.\n\nThe other thing is our inventory management.  And as Don eluded to\nearlier, the U.S. inventories are down year-on-year, even against a\npretty impressive quarterly performance on the revenue line.  So we\'re\njust getting better and more disciplined at managing the marketplace and\ndoing a better job.  I think the idea is not to totally differentiate\nall of the retailers.  I think, what we\'re trying to do is strive for\nthe best retail experience for consumers across the channel landscape.\nAnd continue to support the people that are investing in those things.\n\nVirginia Genereux:  Thanks, and great job.\n\nCharlie Denson:  Thank you.\n\nPam Catlett:  Thanks, Virginia.\n\nOperator:  Our next question comes from Bob Drubl with Lehman Brothers.\n\nBob Drubl:  Hi, good morning.\n\nPam Catlett:  Hi, Bob.\n\nBob Drubl:  Two questions.  The first one, within the U.S. number, can\nyou give us an idea of how foot action played a role within that number,\nand sort of where your business is with Foot Action at this point in\ntime?\n\nDon Blair:  Well between - sorry I\'m on the last question here.  Between\nFoot Locker and Foot Action, Bob, if you look at a year-over-year\ncomparison of the two accounts together, there\'s a couple of points out\nof that 12.  So one of the things, I think, was very encouraging for us\nwas just how broad based the support was in the U.S. from a whole\nvariety of accounts.  So this was not just a Foot Locker, Foot Action\nstory.\n\nBob Drubl:  OK.  And then, within the European comments that you made,\nthat you mentioned the U.K. was a better market for you.  Is it fair to\nsay that that market has turned and, you know, there\'s some improvements\naround the market there?  Or can you maybe elaborate a little bit more\non some of the trends, there?\n\nCharlie Denson:  Yes, Bob, this is Charlie.  The U.K. had a fantastic\nfirst quarter.  We\'re not extrapolating that over the balance of the\nyear.  I\'m reluctant to sit here and say that the U.K. market is\ncompletely turned and headed back in a positive direction.  However I do\nbelieve that it is certainly stabilized.  We\'re continuing to see some\nshake out and consolidation in the marketplace.  And we think that, you\nknow, through using some of the same strategies that we\'ve implemented\nin places like the U.S. that that market will continue to grow and\nexpand on a long-term basis.  And we feel pretty confident, that over\nthe next couple of quarters, we\'ll start to see some indicators that\npoint towards that.  But we\'re not by any means in a position where we\nfeel like things have turned around, and are back on track.\n\nBob Drubl:  Great, thank you.\n\nOperator:  Our next question comes from Margaret Mager with Goldman\nSachs.\n\nMargaret Mager:  Hi, Margaret Mager.  Let\'s see.  A couple of questions\nhere.  First of all, with regard to the gross margin, it\'s been coming\nin way ahead of our expectations for quite some time now.  When you look\nout over the balance of this year, and beyond, could you talk about what\ndo you see as the biggest pieces that can continue to move the gross\nmargins upward?\n\nAnd then, I\'d also like to hear about your forecasting, and how you\'ve\nimprove that, so that you have, you know, better control over your\nbusiness.  So if you could talk about any sort of insight on your\nforecasting methodology and how it relates to your futures orders,\nthanks.\n\nDon Blair:  OK.  To address the question on gross margin first,\nMargaret.  As you know, over the last several years, we\'ve talked about\na lot of the things that have driven the gross margin performance.  One\nof the factors, certainly, has been the improvements we\'ve made in our\nsupply chain, which has resulted in lower supply chain costs, as well as\nan improved position on close outs, which definitely has a positive\nbenefit on gross margin.  And I think in that space, we certainly\nbelieve that we can make continuous improvement in supply chain costs,\nand we still have some room to continue to get better at that, although\nwe\'ve made a lot of progress.\n\nAnd as far as the close out position is concerned, you know, as Charlie\nindicated, our inventories in the U.S. are extremely clean.  We think\nthere\'s still, probably still some opportunities to get to those levels\noutside the U.S.  So we think there\'s some improvement possibilities\nthere.\n\nA second area we\'ve seen a lot of improvement over the last few years\nhas been in the product cost area.  There\'s been a lot of initiatives\nboth in the footwear, apparel, and equipment space, to improve product\ncosts.  And, you know, those efforts are ongoing.  And we think there\'s\ngoing to be continuation and benefit there.\n\nA third area that we\'ve talked about is gross to net management, which\nis making sure that the leakages in the supply chain with respect to the\ncustomers, things like charges, and claims, that we continue to work\nthat beat.  And we\'ve had a lot of success there, and again, we feel\nthat there\'s some more to go.\n\nThe last area I talk about is foreign exchange.  And there are\ndefinitely some benefits we\'ve seen over the last couple of years, as we\nthe euro has strengthened.  With respect to this year, as we said\nearlier, we think the second and third quarters we\'re going to continue\nto get a little bit more benefit out of that, but over the course of the\nyear, that benefit is going to start to narrow as the overlap versus\nlast year\'s exchange rate starts to get closer.\n\nSo, you know, those are really the major items.  And I\'d say on the\noperating side, we\'re continuing to work all of those areas.  And we\nthink there\'s more things to be delivered.\n\nCharlie Denson:  Hey, Margaret I\'ll just add one comment to that.  Which\nas you can tell, I mean I think we\'re fine tuning, and we\'re getting\nmuch better at fine tuning our ability to drive march and performance.\nBut probably the biggest single factor that\'s probably more of an\nintangible is just where the brand is and the demand that we create.\nAnd that certainly drives gross margin expansion as well as all of the\nother fine tuning efforts that we are continuing to get better at.  So\nif you continue to measure the brand strength, you can pretty much track\ngross margin performance against brand strength as well.\n\nMargaret Mager:  OK.  And then, I was asking about forecasting, and if\nthere\'s any insight, you can give to us in terms of how you plan the\nbusiness going forward so that you, you know, maintain good control over\nyour results, your inventory et cetera?\n\nDon Blair:  Well, you know, part of the benefit, Margaret on forecasting\nis that as the supply chain gets tighter, you don\'t have to make as many\nguesses.  You know, and one of the things that we talked about with\nrespect to footwear particularly is that we used to do a lot more blind\nbuying, where we had to actually start production prior to having our\nfutures orders in hand.  And one of the benefits of our new supply chain\nsystem is that it\'s really cut down significantly on the amount of\npurchasing we have to do outside the futures window.\n\nHaving said that, working with our customers, and making sure that we\nhave good estimates for each season, and making sure that we merchandise\nthe line appropriately, and then buy with discipline as Charlie said.  I\nknow he doesn\'t like the word, but making sure that we are maintaining a\npull model in the marketplace and not trying to push product in when\nthe demand is not there, that\'s really one of the things that helps keep\nyour inventories clean, keeps the margins up, and lets you forecast more\nconsistently.\n\nMargaret Mager:  OK. That\'s all very helpful, thanks.  And another great\nquarter and we\'re looking forward to Asia, so thanks to Pam for planning\nthat trip.  And last comment, I love these earnings reports in the\nmorning.\n\nPam Catlett:  Yes.\n\nMargaret Mager:  If you could do that again, that would be great.\nThanks.\n\nPam Catlett:  Don\'t we sound a little sleepy?\n\nMargaret Mager:  No, you sound wonderful.  I\'m sure you\'ve been out for\na five mile run already.\n\nPam Catlett:  That\'s true.  All right, thanks, Margaret.\n\nMargaret Mager:  Bye-bye.\n\nOperator:  Our next question comes from Dennis Rosenberg with Credit\nSuisse First Boston.\n\nDennis Rosenberg:  Good morning, hi, guys.\n\nPam Catlett:  Hi, Dennis.\n\nDon Blair:  Hi, Dennis.\n\nDennis Rosenberg:  On the timing issues in Europe, last year\'s first\nquarter has a real big benefit from a shift out of the second quarter.\nAnd you said you had some benefit this year from a shift from September\nin to August.  Could you give us an idea as to the order or magnitude of\nthe benefit this year versus last year?  And how we should look at the\nsecond quarter because of that shift?\n\nDon Blair:  It was about a couple of points of growth, Dennis.\n\nDennis Rosenberg:  OK and last year was a lot bigger than that, right?\n\nDon Blair:  Yes, that\'s a year-over-year difference.  No, no, it\'s a\nyear-over-year benefit to this year\'s couple of points.\n\nDennis Rosenberg:  So is last year\'s shift a permanent shift?\n\nDon Blair:  No.  I think what you may be thinking about is you may be\nthinking about the year we went live with supply chain which was two\nyears ago.\n\nDennis Rosenberg:  OK.  And the comments on the gross margin, in the\nsecond and third quarter, you said they would be slightly - it would be\na slightly bigger increase in the gross margin, is that relative to the\nfull year, or relative to what you did in the first quarter?\n\nDon Blair:  The year-over-year improvement in the second and third,\nshould be larger than what we saw in the first quarter.\n\nDennis Rosenberg:  OK.  Great.  And I want to second Margaret\'s comments\nabout these morning calls.\n\nPam Catlett:  All right.\n\nDennis Rosenberg:  Thank you.\n\nPam Catlett:  Let\'s pace ourselves here.\n\nOperator:  Our next question comes John Shanley with Susquehanna\nFinancial Group.\n\nJohn Shanley:  Thanks, good morning guys.\n\nDon Blair:  Good morning.\n\nJohn Shanley:  Charlie, we seem very bullish, and probably rightly so on\nthe acquisition of the Starter business.  Can you give us an indication\nof longer term how big this particular operation may be?  And is there\nimplications for the Starter type merchandise going in to markets, other\nthan the United States?\n\nCharlie Denson:  Yes, John, I mean I\'m not - it\'s early in the game to\nmake any even remote projections on what, you know, what the\nopportunities are long-term as far as size.  I\'m not sure we\'d do that\neven if we did have a firm grasp of it.  But I mean we\'re very excited\nabout this, because it gives us an opportunity to, as I said in the\nprepared comments, continue to expand our reach from a distribution\nstandpoint, as one benefit, but certainly the other benefit is it takes\nsome of the pressure off Nike and even Converse to some degree and\nparticipation of some of the different opportunities that we have at\nretail.  So that is very excited for us.  And, you know, again, it\ncontinues to build the overall portfolio against the opportunities in\nthe marketplace.\n\nJohn Shanley:  And is there an opportunity outside the U.S. for that\ntype of product?\n\nCharlie Denson:  We are still too early in the process to say, but we\nwould certainly, you know, we are entertaining that as a possibility.  I\nwouldn\'t be in a position today to tell you that there are those types\nof opportunities.  But we\'re going to look at that as a global brand\nopportunity.\n\nJohn Shanley:  OK.  Fair enough.  Then the other question I had was on\nthe European sales.  It was very helpful to get the comments on the\nindividual countries.  Charlie, can you give us an indication if we\nlooked at it in a bigger geographic area, is the business growing more\nrapidly in Eastern Europe, and the Middle East, than it may be in\nWestern Europe?  I mean is it becoming a much more important component\nof the European sales overall?\n\nCharlie Denson:  Yes, no question, which has been pretty consistent with\nour releases over the last several quarters.  Essentially Europe\ncontinues to be a great marketplace for us as we expand both\ndistribution and market penetration in the central, and now including\nRussia.  So this is the first quarter that we\'ve actually reported\ndirect Russian results.  It\'s another market that we are new in from an\nowned operated standpoint.  And we\'re excited about the future from\nCentral and Eastern Europe.\n\nJohn Shanley:  How about the Middle East?\n\nCharlie Denson:  The Middle East is still hit and miss.  We\'ve got a\ncouple of countries that are doing well, but it\'s still not a\nsignificant portion even of the European business.  OK.\n\nJohn Shanley:  OK.  Fair enough, thanks a lot.  I appreciate it.\n\nDon Blair:  Thanks, John.\n\nOperator:  Our next question comes from Noelle Grainger with JP Morgan.\n\nNoelle Grainger:  Hi, good morning.\n\nPam Catlett:  Good morning.\n\nDon Blair:  Good morning.\n\nNoelle Grainger:  Two questions, the first is, you know, your\ncomparisons get a lot tougher.  Can you talk about the trend over the\nfutures period, given the really strong number you reported?  And then\nthe second question would be back to Europe.  You made a comment, I\nthink, last quarter, about looking to diversify away from football and\ndrive the business more broadly.  And I was hoping that maybe Mark or\nCharlie could elaborate a little bit on, you know, the initiatives\naround that, and kind of where you stand.\n\nDon Blair:  Yes, with respect to the trending, Noelle, there\'s a little\nbit stronger futures in the first half of that window, so that would be\nin our second quarter, but, you know, that doesn\'t necessarily translate\nexactly in to revenues.  As we talk about on every call, you can\'t\nnecessarily match the two up.  But just to layout a couple of the issues\nhere, certainly the U.S. region was posting stronger numbers in the\nsecond half last year, so we\'re going to have to lap over that.\nForeign exchange comparisons get a little tougher as well, you know, as\nwe go in to the second half of the year.  And so those are going to be\nkey elements.\n\nAnd then, we also just talked about Europe, where we had a little bit of\nthe second quarter moving in to the first, so you need to take those\nitems in to account as well.\n\nNoelle Grainger:  OK.  Thank you.\n\nMark Parker:  Yes, and this is Mark.  I\'ll comment on the\ndiversification in Europe beyond football.  I mean obviously, we\'ve\nfocused on football, and I\'ve seen some tremendous success in our\nposition in Europe.  And that focus will continue to be there.\n\nObviously, we have a major sight set on Berlin in \'06, and we\'re going\nto continue our momentum in the football area.  That being said, we also\nrealized, I think, for the strength of our European business overall, we\nreally need to make sure that we can focus on some of the other key\ncategories, such as running, women\'s overall and women\'s\nparticularly in the fitness and training area.  The active business, you\nknow, making sure that between sport and active we\'ve got a good balance\nthere.  We feel really good about our position; at least we\'re trying to\ndevelop right now.  And then, even sports like basketball which are seen\nas being U.S. centric, but really basketball is becoming much more of an\ninternational sport, and some of the European players coming in to the\nU.S.  It\'s really starting to get much more attention over there.\n\nSo we really fully intend to take advantage of that opportunity as well.\nBut we really feel like our long-term success in Europe, and continued\ngrowth is going to be based on diversifying beyond our more singular\nfocus on football.\n\nNoelle Grainger:  OK.  Thanks so much.\n\nPam Catlett:  Thanks, Noelle.\n\nOperator:  Our next question comes from Jeffrey Edelman with UBS.\n\nJeffrey Edelman:  Thank you, good morning.  My first question relates to\nyour retail business.  Could you give us the sense today, how much that\nrepresents of your total sales at this point?  And what were the overall\ncomps for the group?\n\nDon Blair:  Well Jeff, the worldwide our retail sales a little over 10\npercent of our total revenue.  And, you know, the group is obviously\nvery complex.  I mentioned earlier on my prepared remarks, that the\nNiketowns in the U.S. were up nine percent, comp store numbers in the\nfirst quarter.  In the U.S. our factory store results have been somewhat\nless robust.  And frankly, the major issue is lack of inventory.  I mean\nour inventory in the U.S. is so tight that even our factory outlet\nstores don\'t have quite as much product as they\'ve had in previous\nyears, so that\'s a little bit of a good news circumstance for the\noverall business, but a little tough on the factory stores.\n\nYou know, with respect to the other regions, you know, generally retail\nhas been performing pretty well, but it\'s also relative to the markets\nthat we\'re in.  So, you know, Charlie talked about some of the\nchallenges in the U.K. and some of the competition on the high streets\nin Western Europe, we\'ve definitely seen that in Nike retail as well.\nThe strength we\'ve seen in Asia has been reflected in Nike retail, so,\nyou know, it\'s really market specific.\n\nJeffrey Edelman:  OK.  Good.  And secondly, my question has to do with\nthe comments you made about investing in the product value relationship\nin Europe.  It appears as if all of the athletic footwear companies\nselling into Europe have had this big benefit from buying in China and\ncould this be the beginning of some of the passing off ultimately of\nsome of those savings that you\'ve been able to realize?  Because it\nappears to have taken place in a lot of apparel categories throughout\nEurope?\n\nMark Parker:  Well first of all, it\'s not necessarily all about sourcing\nin the sense that we\'ve sourced from Asia for quite a long time, and we\nsource apparel from all over the world, including some of the places in\nEurope and Asia.  I think the foreign exchange situation has definitely\neffected the economics in Europe.  And, you know, with the strengthening\nof the euro, that has meant that, you know, people\'s margins in Europe\nhave definitely expanded.\n\nYou know, our belief as we\'ve said, many times, Jeff is that the value\nequation is not just a function of price; it\'s also a function of the\nvalue of the product or the features in the product that the consumer\ngets.  And so, you know, our approach to investing in the value equation\nis not about rolling back prices across aboard.  What it really is about\nis making sure that there is perceived consumer value at every price\npoint, and with every product category.  And that\'s making sure that you\nhave the right product, with the right features, with the right price\npoint.  And, you know, we\'ve made a definite decision in fiscal \'05, to\nmake sure that we were doing that aggressively to continue to grow the\nEuropean market, because we think there\'s still a lot of growth\npotential left there.  And so we\'re pulling all of those levers.  And\nthe good news is, we\'re continuing to grow our margins even with that\ninvestment.\n\nJeffrey Edelman:  Right.  OK.  Thank you.\n\nPam Catlett:  Thanks, Jeff.\n\nOperator:  Our next question comes from Jim Duffy with Thomas Weisel\nPartners.\n\nJim Duffy:  Yes, good morning.\n\nDon Blair:  Good morning.\n\nPam Catlett:  Hi, Jim.\n\nJim Duffy:  So you now have product in all channels from discount right\nthrough the boutiques.  Can you provide some commentary on what you\'re\nseeing in each of those channels?  And any kind of trends that you think\nmay be sustainable or changes you\'re seeing there?\n\nMark Parker:  Yes, this Mark.  I\'ll start with that.  The back-to-school\nseason here, we\'ve seen probably the most balanced success we\'ve had\nacross distribution - channels of distribution in a long-time.  I think\nit\'s not that we don\'t have some challenges in there.  I think on the\napparel side and the active area, we\'re still seeing some challenges in\nthe bigger department store business.  Overall, though, I think we\'re\nreally focused on our categories in both sport on the active side of our\nbusiness, and managing distribution better.\n\nSo as Charlie said upfront, we\'re starting to see the, you know, success\nin terms of, you know, channel by channel business for back to school.\nSo that\'s - as far as major trends go, I think we\'re going to continue\nto really focus on our business by channel in starting to design, I\nthink, product more effectively up front to make sure that we\'re\nsatisfying the consumers that shop in those channels.  But overall, I\nthink, I\'d just say that the balance we\'ve had for back-to-school has\nbeen the best we\'ve had in a long time.\n\nJim Duffy:  Good.  In the prepared remarks, I couldn\'t help but notice\nthat a lot of your commentary on sporting events, and things that had\ndriven excitement for the brand were kind of respective.  How long do\nyou think, you know, this equity that you have built with that is\nsustainable?  And what are some things you see coming down the pipeline\nthat, you know, can continue to fuel that?\n\nMark Parker:  Well we\'ve - as I\'ve said, we\'ve seen great momentum\ncoming off our Olympic efforts in years past.  This year, I think, it\nwas our best overall from both a business commercial standpoint and a\nbrand standpoint.  And we feel like it\'s given us great momentum moving\nin to fiscal year \'05.\n\nThe buzz off the Olympics, I think, will continue the attention around\nsports.  It will continue not just with the Olympics but the whole, as\nwe said Summer of Sport.  So we have lots of opportunities on the\nproduct front, to take advantage of that buzz.  In footwear, we have\nShox.  We\'re in the middle of, you know, which we\'ll continue to\ndevelop some franchise product in that area, across categories.  We\'re\nin the midst of revamping, re-energizing our whole efforts, so you\'ll\nsee some pretty exciting product coming in this next year along that\nline.\n\nA signature product with Michael Vick, LeBron James, Serena\nWilliams, and others will continue to reenergize those categories.  On\nthe apparel side, both on the active business, our women\'s training and\nfitness product, men\'s performance, team sports, we\'ve worked - we\'re\nworking on a number of technologies that are more accessibly priced to\nmake sure that our mix and product is well balanced.  Soccer will\ncontinue to energize that category.  We have a whole new collection of\nproduct called Tiempo which is, you know, on the heels of Total 90.\nSo we\'ll continue to see that category, see some great product\ninnovation.\n\nSo I think overall, in my time at Nike I\'ve never seen so much great\nproduct coming down the pipeline as I do now, moving in to fiscal year\n\'05, and even in to fiscal year \'06.  So I\'m quite bullish on that\nfront.\n\nCharlie Denson:  Yes, this is Charlie.  I\'ll just add one other comment\nto that too.  I think, you know, we do talk about events a lot and it\ndoes drive a lot of, I think, curiosity and interest from a consumer\nstandpoint, but again, we kind of get out of that mode now, and go back\nin to that mundane, athletic approach to the, you know, the athletes and\nthe contests that go on on an annual basis.  And what that does, and\nMark mentioned it too, is the idea that it gives us a chance now to\nfocus on the athlete again, and start to draw on those athlete\npersonalities.  And those are some of the things that really give\nadditional dimensions and some accessibility to the brand around the\nworld.\n\nJim Duffy:  Do the events drive a fashion cycle, historically, have you\nseen that?\n\nMark Parker:  Yes, I think, so.  I think the Olympic effort we had, you\nknow, it\'s a little early to tell what kind of fashion trend might be\ncoming off the Olympics, for example.  But I think you\'ll see closer\nfitting product.  You know, you\'ve seen that in the fashion world, but\nit\'s definitely in the sport world with some of the Pro Compression, for\nexample, a little more body fitting product.  You\'ll see that trend, I\nthink, continue through this next year.\n\nAnd some of that, I\'m not sure if Serena Williams outfit will translate\ninto broad commercial sales as an outfit, like the one you saw at the\nU.S. Open.  But we have some great product coming for the Australian\nOpen with Maria Sharapova and Serena as well.  We have every intent to\nmake sure that what we do on the court, on the field really translates\nin to commercial success, both in performance and then through the\nactive business as well.\n\nJim Duffy:  Very good.  Thanks for your time.\n\nPam Catlett:  Hey, Jim, I do want to just point out that Charlie was\nbeing tongue in cheek with his comment about mundane athlete\nperformances.  Just for the record.\n\nJim Duffy:  Right.  I understand.\n\nPam Catlett:  OK, Stephanie, we\'ll take one more question.\n\nOperator:  Thank you.  Our last question comes from Robert Toomey with\nRBC Dain Rauscher.\n\nRobert Toomey:  Good morning.  I just want to get a better\nunderstanding, if you could spend a minute or two talking about your\nlong-term strategies for both Converse and Starter.  I know you answered\na question earlier about Starter, but I\'m not totally clear how you\'re\ngoing to leverage that business.  And I wondered if you could just\nexpand a little bit on your strategies for both of those.  And where you\nexpect the growth to come from?  Thank you.\n\nCharlie Denson:  Yes, this is Charlie.  I think we\'re also with Converse\nright now; Converse is having a great performance around the world.  Don\nmentioned a little bit about the fact that most of the international\nbusiness is a licensed business.  And we do not own the Converse\nbusiness in Japan.  So there\'s still a lot of upside there.  It\'s\nprimarily a footwear business.  And I think there\'s some opportunities\nto expand the product range under that product range, and certainly the\ndistribution around the world.  So that\'s something that we think and\ntalk a lot about there.\n\nI think from a Starter standpoint, as I said, we\'re very early in the\nprocess as we evaluate our opportunities and what our priorities are in\ndeveloping there.  It is primarily an apparel brand.  And so, there\nwould be some obvious opportunities that we can pursue in footwear that\nwe\'re looking at as well.\n\nAnd so - and I don\'t want to venture out into an international\nproposition around that, right now.  It\'s very early in the stages of\ndevelopment of the business.  And we will keep you guys abreast of the\ndecisions that we make as we go forward.\n\nMark Parker:  Yes, this is Mark.  I\'ll just add, you know, the fact is\nwe, as Charlie mentioned in his prepared remarks, we have a pretty\nrobust portfolio of Nike, Inc. brands, both footwear and apparel.  So\nwe\'re in a great position to really take advantage of the opportunities\nthose brands represent.\n\nThere\'s a lot of design, and technology that\'s developed within Nike.\nAnd we really feel like we\'re in a position to feed that design and\ntechnology to different brands, being respectful that each of these\nbrands is different as a different position, different distribution.\nBut the fact is that the Nike product machine, design development\nmachine, can really, I think, exploit opportunity more effectively\nacross such a great portfolio of brands.  So we\'re quite bullish\nfrankly.\n\nAnd on the international front, I wouldn\'t as Charlie said, make any\npredictions in the short-term.  But certainly, in the long-term, that\'s\ngoing to be more of a part of the future of our other non-Nike brands.\n\nDon Blair:  And Bob, just to clarify too from a financial standpoint,\nStarter operates largely on a license model as well.  So it is a model\nthat will not necessarily generate large amounts of revenue, but\nobviously has a very high flow through of the profitability.  So just in\nterms of managing your expectations in terms of how that business will\ndevelop in our financial results, you don\'t necessarily see it as much\non the top line as you will on the bottom line.\n\nRobert Toomey:  OK.  So will the Nike brand be marketed through Starter?\nOr would you overlap the brands?  I\'m not clear on that.\n\nMark Parker:  No.  Nike brand and Starter are completely separate brands\nand will not overlap.\n\nRobert Toomey:  OK.  Great.  Thank you.\n\nPam Catlett:  All right.  Thanks everybody for joining us today.  We\nwanted to just remind you that we\'re heading to our annual meeting of\nshareholders here this morning.  So any follow up questions we\'ll do our\nbest to get back to you, but it will probably be later this afternoon.\nOK.  Thanks very much.  Have a great day.\n\nOperator:  This does conclude today\'s teleconference.  Thank you for\nyour participation.  You may now disconnect.\n\n\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n-----END PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE-----\n']
