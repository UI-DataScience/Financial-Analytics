National Technical Systems, Inc.\n(Nasdaq:NTSC) (NTS), a leading provider of quality and conformance testing and\nmanaged services for industries, including aerospace, defense,\ntelecommunications and information technology, today announced results for its\nfiscal 2005 second quarter and six months ended July 31, 2004.\n\n      According to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jack Lin, Ph.D., net\nrevenues for the fiscal 2005 second quarter were $27.1 million, with net income\nof $242,000, or $0.03 per fully diluted share, compared to total net revenues of\n$27.2 million, with net income $341,000, or $0.04 per fully diluted share for\nthe year-earlier period. For the first six months of fiscal 2005, total net\nrevenues were $54.4 million, with net income of $775,000, or $0.09 per basic\nshare and $0.08 per fully diluted share. Net revenues for the first six months\nof fiscal 2004 were $54.0 million with net income of $668,000, or $0.08 per\nbasic share and $0.07 per fully diluted share.\n\n      The income tax rates for the three months and six months of fiscal 2005\nwere lower than the income tax rates for the same periods in fiscal 2004 due to\nthe earnings associated with the Company\'s foreign subsidiary which\nsignificantly increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 and are considered\nto be permanently invested and consequently no provision for U.S. federal or\nstate income taxes are provided for this subsidiary.\n\n      President and Chief Operating Officer William C. McGinnis commented,\n"While we are disappointed that we did not see a continuation of top- and\nbottom-line growth in this fiscal year\'s second quarter, we remain focused on\nincreasing revenues and profits and believe that we are well positioned to\nrecover from this interruption in the momentum we began generating last year. We\nare continuing to concentrate on expanding our service offerings both\ndomestically and internationally, and are pursuing opportunites to cost\neffectively increase our services in existing\n\n\n                                      -1-\n', u'\n\nmarkets in locations close to our customers, as well as to expand our services\ninto new growth markets. We believe that these investments will produce positive\nresults."\n\n      During the first half of this fiscal year, NTS invested in expanding its\nDetroit testing facility by increasing its airbag testing capabilities to\ninclude rollover airbags to meet the demands of automotive manufacturers.\nRollover airbags are the latest innovation in passenger protection and require\nintensive testing to verify performance. Since vehicle safety is an automotive\nindustry focus, NTS expects to see a number of innovations in this area, which\nshould lead to additional testing requirements.\n\n      Another example of NTS\'s commitment to its expansion strategy was its\nrecent acquisition of a small testing laboratory in Calgary, Canada, which\nenhances the Company\'s telecommunication certification and testing services and\naugments its plans for increasing its capabilities in wireless product\ncertification and testing. The acquisition of this lab has also made it possible\nfor NTS to concurrently enter into a testing agreement with a large Canadian\ntelecommunication manufacturer. Strategically, this addition enables NTS to\noffer convenient services to other companies located in Canada and the northern\nUnited States.\n\n      The Company\'s July 31, 2004 balance sheet remained strong, with cash of\n$3.2 million, total assets of $64.9 million, shareholders equity of $29.8\nmillion and a current ratio of 3.1:1. The fully diluted share counts used in\ncalculating earnings per share in the second quarter and first six months of\nthis fiscal year were 9,541,000 and 9,570,000 respectively, and the fully\ndiluted share counts used in the comparable periods of the prior fiscal year\nwere 9,235,000 and 9,105,000, respectively.\n\n      Revenues from the Engineering & Evaluation segment for the fiscal 2005\nsecond quarter and six months were $15.6 million and $31.3 million,\nrespectively, compared to $15.7 million and $29.9 million for the year-earlier\nperiods. Revenues in the segment in both periods were increased by revenues from\nthe acquisition of DTI Holdings, which was effective late in the fiscal 2004\nfourth quarter, increases in the Company\'s space and automotive testing\nbusinesses, and an improvement in the computer testing business in Japan. These\nincreases were offset in the 2005 second quarter and partially offset in the\nfirst six months of 2005 by a decrease in passive fiber optic testing and a\ndecrease in defense related business at the Camden, AK facility, which included\nrevenues in the prior year from a major contract related to the war on\nterrorism. The contract was completed during the second quarter of the prior\nyear.\n\n      Engineering & Evaluation gross profit as a percentage of revenue in the\nsecond quarter and first six months of fiscal 2005 was 25.7 percent and 26.2\npercent, respectively, compared to 28.2 percent and 27.2 percent in the\nrespective periods in the prior fiscal year. The decline in gross profit margin\npercentage in both periods was principally due to the effect of fixed costs and\ncompetitive pricing pressures, combined with decreases in gross profit from the\nCompany\'s passive fiber optic testing business and at the Company\'s Camden\nfacility.\n\n      Engineering & Evaluation operating income for the fiscal 2005 second\nquarter and first six months was $393,000 and $1.2 million, respectively,\ncompared to $992,000 and $1.7 million for the year earlier periods. Operating\nincome in the segment was impacted in both periods by increases in selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses, when compared to the same periods in\n\n\n                                      -2-\n', u"\n\nfiscal 2004. These increases were primarily due to one-time start-up costs\nassociated with the development of new test specifications for emerging wireless\ntechnologies and the development of capabilities to perform testing on new DSL\nservices, and one-time costs incurred by the Company to prepare for Section 404\nof the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that makes reporting on internal controls mandatory\nfor all SEC registrants, sales costs related to efforts to expand the Company\nnationally and internationally and the addition of new sales and customer\nservice representatives. Selling, general and administrative expenses also\nincreased due to costs related to the improvement of the Company's internal IT\ninfrastructure and website.\n\n      Revenues from Technical Solutions for the fiscal 2005 second quarter and\nfirst six months were $11.5 million and $23.1 million, respectively, compared to\n$11.6 million and $24.2 million for the year-earlier periods. Technical\nSolutions revenues declined in both periods due to continued weakness in the IT\nmarket staffing business.\n\n      In the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2005, Technical\nSolutions gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 16.2 percent and 15.7\npercent, respectively, compared to 16.0 percent and 15.8 percent in the prior\nfiscal year's respective periods. The modest year-to-year increase in gross\nprofit margin percentage in the fiscal 2005 second quarter was due to an\nimprovement in contract margins.\n\n      Operating income for Technical Solutions in the fiscal 2005 second quarter\nand six months was $203,000 and $322,000, respectively, when compared to $21,000\nand $163,000 for the year earlier periods. The increase in Technical Solutions\noperating income in both periods was primarily due to reductions in selling\ncosts associated with lower revenues and administrative cost reductions. The\nincrease in operating income in the first six months of fiscal 2005 was\npartially offset by a decrease in gross profit for the segment.\n\n      The Engineering & Evaluation segment is one of the largest independent\nconformity assessment and management system registration organizations in the\nU.S., with facilities throughout the U.S. and in Japan and Germany serving a\nlarge variety of high technology industries, including aerospace, defense,\nautomotive, power products, electronics, computers and telecommunications. In\naddition, this segment performs management registration and certification\nservices to ISO related standards.\n\n      The Technical Solutions segment is a national provider of professional and\nspecialty staffing services including contract services, temporary and full time\nplacements, providing specialty solutions services to its customers specifically\nin the area of IT, information systems, software engineering and construction\nneeds. Technical Solutions supplies professionals in support of customers who\nneed help-desk analysts and managers, relational database administrators and\ndevelopers, application and systems programmers, configuration and project\nmanagers, engineering personnel and multiple levels of system operations\npersonnel.\n\nConference Call\n\n      As previously announced, NTS is conducting a conference call to review the\nfinancial results today at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time (8:30 a.m. Pacific Time).
