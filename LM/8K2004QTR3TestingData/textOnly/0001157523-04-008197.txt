(AMEX:TLL) today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended May\n31, 2004.\n     "Our two-way radio division had record sales in the fourth quarter as state\nand local governments began to upgrade their radio systems as a result of\nincreased funding for Homeland Security," stated J. Kernan Crotty, President of\nTeletouch Communications, Inc. "We anticipate the increased demand for two-way\nradio equipment will continue into fiscal 2005. Additionally, during the\nquarter, Teletouch completed the acquisition of Preferred Networks, Inc. which\nwill allow the Company to provide paging service throughout most of Georgia."\n     "In the fourth quarter, we formed a new subsidiary, Visao Systems, Inc., to\nfocus on telemetry sales. We recorded the first sales of our LifeGuard telemetry\ndevice, a personal monitoring unit, in the fourth quarter to a Fortune 50\ncompany. We have a number of telemetry devices in trial programs with customers\nbut the sales cycle is a lot longer than we had expected and we will be\nmonitoring and assessing the division\'s progress over the next six months,"\nconcluded Mr. Crotty.\n\n     Fourth Quarter 2004 Results\n\n     Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $6.7 million compared with $7.4\nmillion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The decline in revenue since last\nyear was primarily due to fewer pagers in service. Pagers in service declined\n22.8% to 168,000 compared with 217,700 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.\nThe decline in pagers in service was the result of lower demand for one-way\npaging services. Product sales increased to $1,322,000 compared with $923,000 in\nthe fourth quarter of last fiscal year primarily due to higher sales of two-way\nradio equipment, offset by lower sales of paging equipment.\n     Net loss applicable to common stockholders was $135,000 in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal 2004 compared with net income applicable to common\nstockholders of $484,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Net loss per\ndiluted share was $0.03 on 4.5 million weighted average shares outstanding\ncompared with net income per share of $0.01 on 54.6 million weighted average\nshares outstanding in the same period of the prior year.\n\n     Fiscal 2004 Results\n\n     Total revenues for fiscal 2004 were $26.8 million compared with $34.8\nmillion in fiscal 2003. The decline in revenues was due to fewer pagers in\nservice. Pagers in service declined to 168,000 at fiscal year end compared with\n217,700 at fiscal year end 2003.\n     Teletouch reduced total debt in fiscal 2004. At fiscal year-end, short-term\ndebt was $0 compared with $109,000 in fiscal 2003. Long-term debt was reduced to\n$448,000 in fiscal 2004 compared with $760,000 in fiscal 2003.\n     Teletouch\'s operating loss was $166,000 in fiscal 2004 compared with\noperating loss of $1,688,000 million in fiscal 2003. The reduction in operating\nloss, excluding restructuring costs, was primarily due to Teletouch\'s exit of\nits retail distribution channel in fiscal 2003. Costs declined for operations,\nselling, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization by 15.2%\nto $19.6 million in fiscal 2004 compared with $23.2 million in the prior year\nbut increased to 73% of revenues in 2004 compared with 67% of revenues in 2003.\n     The Company recorded a net loss applicable to common stockholders of\n$519,000, or $0.11 per diluted share, in fiscal 2004 compared with net income\navailable to common stockholders of $35.6 million, or $0.39 per diluted share,\nin fiscal 2003. The fiscal 2003 results include a $36.4 million gain on\npreferred stock transaction.\n\n     About Teletouch Communications, Inc.\n\n     Teletouch Communications provides wireless messaging, telemetry services,\ncellular and two-way radio communications services in Alabama, Arkansas,\nGeorgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and\nTennessee.
