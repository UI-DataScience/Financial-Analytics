Net income for the third\nquarter of fiscal 2004 increased to $90,000, after a $30,000 tax benefit, as\ncompared to $13,000 for the same quarter last year.\n\nFor the thirty-nine weeks ended July 31, 2004, Earnings before interest taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization, ("EBITDA") aggregated $1,439,000, as compared to\n$1,479,000 for the forty weeks ended August 2, 2003. (EBITDA for the first nine\nmonths of 2004 was calculated as follows: pre-tax income of $786,000, plus\ninterest of $150,000 and depreciation and amortization of $503,000. EBITDA for\nthe first nine months of fiscal 2003 was calculated as follows: pre-tax income\nof $635,000, plus interest of $263,000 and depreciation and amortization of\n$581,000).\n\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2004, EBITDA aggregated $269,000 as compared to\n$303,000 for the same quarter last year.

As a result, comparable\nstore sales for the thirty-nine weeks ended July 31, 2004 increased\napproximately $991,000 or 3.1% from the same period last year.\n\nMr. Franklin Karp, President of Harvey Electronics stated, "Our third quarter\nand nine month results were stronger than anticipated. Comparable store sales,\nour strong gross profit margin and our pre-tax income for the nine month period\nall increased from the prior year."\n\n"Plasma, LCD and micro-display flat panel televisions, as well as the Company\'s\nprofessional custom installation services continued to drive our business in the\nthird quarter. However, we are also pleased to see increases in our higher\nmargin audio business for the second quarter in a row, as we have better\ndemonstrated and bundled the sale of these products with the video products\ndriving the industry."\n\nMr. Karp continued, "Our overall gross profit margin of over 41% continues to be\nstrong, due to the increase in sales of higher margin accessories, extended\nwarranties, labor, and an 8% increase in our profitable custom installation\nbusiness. Continued improvement of these sales categories continues to be a\nmajor focus for Harvey."\n\nMr. Joseph Calabrese, Chief Financial Officer noted "It is important to note\nthat while the Company recorded an income tax equivalent provision of $260,000\nfor the nine months ended July 31, 2004, this provision will not materially\naffect the Company\'s ultimate tax liability as Harvey is utilizing net operating\nloss carryforwards. As a result, we believe pre-tax income and EBITDA are key\nfinancial measurements of our Company\'s operations and performance."\n\nMr. Calabrese concluded, "Comparable selling, general and administrative\nexpenses for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 have increased 2.6% as\ncompared to the same period last year, demonstrating the Company\'s ability to\ncontrol expenses, despite the rising costs associated with our personnel and\noccupancy. I am also pleased to report a 43% decline in interest expense for the\nfirst nine months of fiscal 2004, due primarily from reduced borrowings and\nlower costs relating to our new credit facility."\n\nMr. Karp concluded, "We plan to continue to hire additional personnel to support\nthe planned expansion of our custom installation initiatives. These services are\nprofitable for Harvey and differentiate us in the market. We are excited about\nthe new service initiatives and additionally by the new Harvey showroom in\nBridgewater, New Jersey, which is expected to open in early 2005. We are\noptimistic about the fourth quarter and the overall results of fiscal 2004."\n\nFrom time to time, information provided by the Company, statements made by its\nemployees or information, included in its filings with the Securities and\nExchange Commission may contain statements, which are so-called "forward-looking\nstatements" and not historical facts.
