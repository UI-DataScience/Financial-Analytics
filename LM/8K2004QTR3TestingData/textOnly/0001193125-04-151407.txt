My name is Gina I\x92ll be your conference coordinator. At this time all lines are in a\nlisten only mode and at the end of the conference call we will be accepting questions. If you ever need operator assistance push 2 star 0. At this time we\x92ll turn the call over to Bill Walljasper. Over to you sir. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper - ', u'Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today on the call to discuss Casey\x92s results for the first quarter of fiscal 2005,\nended July 31. I\x92m Bill Walljasper, Chief Financial Officer, also joining me today is Ron Lamb, CEO, Bob Myers, President and Chief Operating Officer and John Harmon Senior Vice President. I hope all of you had a chance to see the press\nrelease. If you haven\x92t please, let me know and we\x92ll make sure a copy gets forwarded to you. Now before I begin, I will remind you that certain statements may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As discussed in the press release in the 2004 annual report such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially\nfrom future results expressed or implied in those statements. Casey\x92s disclaims any intention or obligation to update or other revise forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. I will take a\nfew minutes to review the highlights of the quarter and then open it for questions. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We had a very solid quarter with earnings rising 14% to 32 cents per share from 28 cents per share a year ago. The main reason for this increase was a higher than normal gasoline margin. After experiencing rising wholesale costs for\ngasoline in the past 2 quarters we finally saw this trend reverse for parts of the first quarter of fiscal 2005. As a result our gas margin was 11.8 cents in the quarter, well above our annual goal of 10.5 cents And this represents approximately 4\ncents per share. Now, we mentioned in the last conference call, and in the annual report that we\x92ve been focusing on our management of gasoline. Now due to our efforts we were able to take advantage of the market conditions in the first\nquarter. The result was a gamble over a half a cent on the first quarter margin due to actively managing the risk of our gasoline inventory. However, with any program of this nature, there are risks and future changes in the gasoline environment may\nnot enable us to see this type of gain going forward. Gross profit in this category was up nearly 22% to $31 million. On a same-store basis, gallons were down 1.5% \x97 excuse me, 1.4% This was due to continued high retail price of gasoline\naffecting demand. The ', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'1 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'average retail price was $1.83 this quarter compared to $1.42 a year ago. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In the grocery and other merchandise category total sales were up 4.4%, to 196.1 million. Same-store sales were up 1.9% with an average\nmargin of 31.3. We are pleased with the gains we are making in this category we\x92re making positive steps towards our annual goal of 2.9% same store sales increase and a margin over 32. As all of you may have seen, same-store sales were up 3.4%,\nin the month of July, and we were optimistic this will continue into the second quarter. Cigarettes are a main component in this category. As many of you know we do not publish the margin for cigarettes; however, the cigarette margin for the quarter\nis nearly back to where it was a year ago when we were receiving substantially higher retail display allowance money. The strategies that we now have in place for managing this item appear to be working and the gains we have made at the retail level\nhave nearly made up for the reduction in RDA monies that we experienced last year. Also, same-store sales for cigarettes in the second and the third quarters of last year, were in the high negative single digits. We believe we that have this item\nheaded in the right direction and we remain optimistic going forward. Prepared food continues to do very well. Sales were up 10% with same-store sales up 5.8% in the quarter. The margin was 58.7. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Now despite being affected by higher prices of cheese, gross profit was up 6.3%, to 30.6\nmillion. Our cost of cheese averaged $1.97 a pound this quarter compared to $1.48 a year ago. That\x92s nearly 1.5 cents on earnings. As a result of some internal communications, in the last conference call I indicated that our average cost of\ncheese in the fourth quarter as $2.02 a pound. That was actually nearly the average of the month of April. The average cost of cheese for the fourth quarter was $1.77 per pound. Currently our total cost of cheese is at $1.72 per pound. At the end of\nthe quarter, we have 603 stores with point of sale and we\x92re confident we\x92ll meet our goal for 900 stores by the end of the fiscal year. We should also have handheld scanners rolled out to approximately 900 stores by the end of the fiscal\nyear. These units will be used by the managers to enhance inventory control measures for products that are delivered directly to our stores. We have been able to use the information gained from point of sale to initiate a store reset to improve\nshelf space allocation and product selection. Now early indications of this reset are positive. Operating expenses for the quarter were up 8%, primarily due to a 27% increase in bank charges from customers using credit cards, to purchase more\nexpensive gasoline. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Inside sales were up 5.5%, now this is below our annual\ngoal; however, total gross profit was in line with operating expenses rising 8%. On the balance sheet at July 31, cash and cash equivalents increased to 55.5 million and shareholders equity rose to 452.3 million, up 12.5 million. We continue to pay\ndown debt, long-term debt net of current maturities was down to 16.5 million to 127.7 million. Cash flow from operations is 46.5 million, compared to 30.5 million at this time last year. We have used 16.7 for capital expenditures compared to 18.3\nmillion a year ago. We anticipate capital expenditures to increase over the upcoming quarters as we begin to close on more acquisitions. Our long-term debt-to-total capital ratio, including the current portion is 26%. This quarter we built 1 new\nstore, closed on 3 acquisitions and have written agreements for 2 more. We also have 13 verbal agreements pending. Since the end of the quarter we have opened 2 more additional stores. Now that completes my review of the quarter we\x92ll now take\nyour questions. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'2 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'QUESTION AND ANSWER ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Operator ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please key star 1 on your\ntouch-tone phone. If you would you like to withdraw your question, please key star 2. Your questions will be taken in the order they are received by. Please hold for your first question. And we\x92ll take a question from Dennis Telzrow of Stevens\nInc.. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Dennis Telzrow ', u'- Stephens Inc. - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Good morning, Bill. Great quarter. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO,\nVP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yes, good to hear from you. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Dennis Telzrow ', u'- Stephens Inc. - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'A couple of questions one is the store reset completely done in all the stores? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill\nWalljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'That\x92s correct. We started the reset back in May and it was completed about the middle of July. So we\x92re \x97 early indications albeit they are very early are positive, and we\x92re hopeful that going into the second quarter\nwe should see even a little bit more gain. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Dennis Telzrow ', u'- Stephens Inc. - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'And I think you mentioned that you gained a half a cent in the gas margin through active management? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yes that\x92s correct. On the gasoline inventory. We can \x97 would you like us to expand on that, Dennis? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Dennis Telzrow ', u'- Stephens Inc. - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yeah, if you could. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'I\x92m going to have Bob Myers expand on it a little bit. ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bob Myers - Casey\x92s General Stores - Pres, COO ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'All right Dennis, good morning. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Dennis Telzrow ', u'- Stephens Inc. - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Good morning. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bob Myers\n', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - Pres, COO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'As you\nknow, we are actively managing our 3 categories of fuels, our retail margins, our inventory, and our fleet diesel usage. With the rising cost of both crude and rack fuel, have provided the opportunity to hedge our inventory. And those hedges prove\nto be very successful resulting in that half a cent increase in the average retail margin. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yes. Dennis, this is something we\x92ve been talking about for a while,\nand I think our hard work is paying off now. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Dennis Telzrow ', u'- Stephens Inc. - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Okay. Yeah, sounds good. And the \x97 do you still feel comfortable with the goals as far as store acquisitions and growth and such?\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yeah, you know, as you know, in the press release, John Harmon was promoted to Senior Vice President, now in charge of store development and\nI will let John field that question, give you a little up-to-the-date our acquisition activity. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'John Harmon ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - Sr. VP, Sec., Director', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yeah hi Dennis? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Dennis Telzrow - Stephens Inc. - Analyst ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Hi, John ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'John Harmon ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - Sr. VP, Sec., Director', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'I know we\x92re still a low slow on the numbers in the first quarter\nbut the pipeline is really starting to fill up. We\x92ve got several singles, I think Bill mentioned 13 verbals. I would say you can easily change that to 14. I know that\x92s not a big deal, but \x97 and ', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'3 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'then another thing, I think we\x92re really focusing on now we\x92re looking at the smaller chains around here. Most of our acquisitions in the past have\nbeen on the ones and twos, but there are a few chains in our area that we\x92re really looking at hard. So hopefully we\x92ll be able to announce something here pretty soon on something like that. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Dennis to add to that, I would say the majority of those 14 that John mentioned should close in the upcoming quarters. We may not open them\ndue to capital expenditures but we should have written agreements. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Dennis Telzrow ', u'- Stephens Inc. - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Okay. Thank you very much. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill\nWalljasper', u' - Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Thanks, Dennis. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Operator ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'And we\x92ll take your next question come from Anthony Hayes of Sidoti & Company. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Anthony Hayes ', u'- Sidoti & Company - Analyst', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Good morning. I apologize I the joined the call late so you may have\nalready addressed this. But looking at the gas margin it was certainly higher than what I was looking for and I just heard you talk about the half cent improvement from better management of the inventory. Can you talk about what you are seeing so\nfar? One month into the second quarter, are you still seeing the same kind of margins now in August? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yeah, and for August, you know, we\x92re going release same-store sales\nSeptember 15. Just to give you a little idea of some preliminary indications, with respect to August, we should see a same-store sale number near our goal of 2%. The margin will be above our historical average of 10.5 cents for the month of August.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Anthony Hayes', u' - Sidoti & Company - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Mm-hmm. Okay. With respect to the prepared food and fountain, you know, the margin, was below last year\x92s levels for the first quarter. Is that all related to the\ncheese costs or are there any other factors affecting that margin? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'No, the majority of that is strictly a cheese issue. As I mentioned in\nthe opening remarks, the \x97 our cost of cheese was $1.97 this quarter compared to $1.48 the previous quarter last year. Now, that is coming down. We\x92re hopeful, because cheese is a very cyclical product, typically some time around the end\nof September, first of October is when cheese cycles downward. And we\x92re hopeful that will continue a downward cycle where we might see an opportunity to jump into an advantageous purchase of cheese. And try to lock in our cheese price as we\ndid about a year ago through the next summer months. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Anthony Hayes ', u'- Sidoti & Company - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Mm-hmm. And with respect for the grocery and other merchandise margin, that was also down from last year. It looks like, you know,\ncigarettes impacted that, right? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Bill Walljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'You know, Anthony, actually, if you look at the \x97 we have a lot of bright spots about the quarter. When I look at the quarter one of\nthe bright spots that I see is that our margin of 31.3 in the grocery and merchandise category was nearly the same as it was last year at 31.5. If we look at cigarettes, our margin is nearly back at the same level as it was last year, and that is\ntaking into consideration that we had significant RDA monies last year that that we do not have this year. So it\x92s a credit to what [Terry Hanley] in operation has going on in that category. So we were down a little bit in the pop category\nwhich probably brought that margin down from 31.5 to 31.3. And again that was primarily driven by RDA monies that we have in the pop category last year that we don\x92t have this year. So I\x92m optimistic about that category. And It seems like\nwe have the cigarette item headed in the right direction. And as I mentioned in my remarks, the same-store sales comparisons heading into Q2 and Q3, obviously become a little bit easier. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Anthony\nHayes ', u'- Sidoti & Company - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Mm-hmm. Got\nyou. Okay, and then lastly, just the housekeeping question. What was the store count for the Company stores and franchise stores at the end of the first quarter? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill\nWalljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'1325 was the total and 34 franchise stores remaining. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Anthony Hayes ', u'- Sidoti & Company - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'4 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Okay, 1325 you said? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General\nStores - CFO, VP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yeah, 1325. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Anthony Hayes ', u'- Sidoti & Company - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Okay. Thanks. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Thank you. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Operator\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We\x92ll take your next question from Jay Levy of Credit Suisse First\nBoston. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Jay Levy', u' - Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Hi, thanks. Congratulations, guys. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO,\nVP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Thanks. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Jay Levy ', u'- Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Just a quick question on the 27% increase of bank charges. How much of that is due to increased credit card usage? And how much is due to an increased fee? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Well, it\x92s going to be a combination \x97 well, it\x92s really going to be a combination of 2 things. One is obviously the higher\nretail price of gas even if credit card utilization stays the same, the bank charges are going to go up in relation to that. But also I believe when you start to get into $1.80 to $1.90 range for gas, people have a tendency to purchase more with\ncredit cards than they would with cash. I don\x92t have an exact breakout for you on, that however. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Jay Levy', u' - Credit Suisse First Boston\x97Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Okay. And on the satellite network, does that help combat some of that, or are you kind of\nexposed right now? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'No, it will eventually help in that regard. The satellite communications now has been completely rolled out. We are continuing to improve\nwhat we call outs and no-fits and basically a no-fit is when a tanker gets to a store and can only drop half a load, then they have to go, either back to the terminal or some other location and drop it. It increases freight charges. So logically as\nwe get better and continue to improve in those 2 categories for that area that should be incremental to help us out on the sale so we\x92re not going to be out of gas. But it also should help us out in the margin because we\x92re not going to\nhave additional freight charges related to the no fits. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Jay Levy', u' - Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Got it. And on the prepared food gross margin, how much of the change in gross margin is due to the price of cheese? I mean, can you isolate\nthat one commodity? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'I don\x92t have a specific number but I can tell you nearly all of it. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Jay Levy\n', u'- Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Okay.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'And I just met yesterday with the gentleman in charge of the prepared food category who who is doing just an outstanding job. He indicates\nthat cheese prices are continuing to decline. He is hopeful that they will run this normal course. And some time at the end of September first of October there may be an opportunity to \x97 for us to lock in and if we lock in, we will feel much\nmore comfortable on that 60 \x97 over 60 margin goal. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Jay Levy - Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Okay. Can you say if prepared food gross margin would have been above the 60 without the cheese? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yes. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Jay Levy ', u'- Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Okay. And one question on traffic count during the quarter with the gas\nsame-store sales down 1.4%, did you see any impact on the traffic then on the inside store? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'5 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We still have positive customer count going forward. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Jay Levy ', u'- Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Okay. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill\nWalljasper', u' - Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'So that\x92s another plus. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Jay Levy ', u'- Credit Suisse First Boston - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Okay. Perfect. Thanks, Bill. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores -\nCFO, VP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Thanks. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Operator ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Again, if you would like to ask a question, please key star 1 on your touch-tone phone. We\x92ll take a question from Fred [Suisse] of [Suisse] First and Capital. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Fred Suisse ', u'- Suisse First and Capital - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yes. In the SG&A, is there insurance costs up? Last quarter you identified that up as an issue. Is that year over year up or down now or? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Insurance costs were up about 5%. Which is pretty much in line with normal increases in that area. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Fred Suisse', u' - Suisse First and Capital - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Okay. And then just philosophically, we talked about this before, but the \x97 you put this number of 443 stores, which I assume is just a guess. You don\x92t have it\nprecise there. It might be 40, it might be 45 but there\x92s no urgency and pressure John to get that done. I hope that the price you pay is more important than getting it done. Can you just address that issue? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yeah, I will comment on that and maybe John might have an elaboration. But I can tell you this Fred; we will not chase a number, just\nbecause a number is out there is not going to mean we\x92re going to chase a number just so we can say we hit 43 acquisitions. We still have a very strong due diligence process and John is enhancing that process, to make sure that we continue to\nbuy effectively. So \x97 ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Fred Suisse ', u'- Suisse First and Capital - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'And the Board\x92s on board with that ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper', u' - Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO,\nVP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x97 that John is not going to be rewarded or punished if\nhe gets 43 plus or minus? Absolutely that discussion \x97 we just had that very recently, Fred. And he\x92s not compensated in any way on hitting the 43 number or not hitting the 43 number. And that\x92s one of the reasons why we implemented\nthe return on invested capital component with respect to the executive compensation structure. Obviously, if we start to purchase in ineffectively, that number will start to erode. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Fred\nSuisse', u' - Suisse First and Capital - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Terrific. Thank you. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'John, is there something you wanted to add to that? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'John\nHarmon ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - Sr. VP, Sec., Director', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yeah, Fred. Believe me when I say there\x92s no pressure to get that number. When we calculated the 43, that amounted to half of our franchise stores and then a goal of 25 outside acquisitions. So that\x92s really all the scientific\nbasis behind the 43. I do think we have a chance of hitting that goal. The new stores, that might be the tough one. We have 15 for that and right now, I don\x92t know if we\x92ll get 15 new stores opened this year. But, again, there\x92s\nreally no pressure at all. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Fred Suisse ', u'- Suisse First and Capital - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Okay. And when you go from buying individual boxes to small chains, does the \x97 is there a generalization of valuations that is different? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'John Harmon ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - Sr. VP, Sec., Director', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'6 ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'That varies so much from chain to chain. A lot of it depends on how well they fit our store model. So really, to give you\na range, you would be such a wide range, I don\x92t think I could. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Fred Suisse ', u'- Suisse First and Capital - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Okay, great. Thank you very much. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Bill Walljasper ', u'- Casey\x92s General Stores - CFO, VP', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Thanks, Fred.
