Announces Fourth Quarter Financial Results\n\n    HUNTINGTON STATION, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 9, 2004--American\nTechnical Ceramics Corp. (AMEX Symbol: AMK), a leading manufacturer of\nhigh-performance electronic components, including capacitors and thin\nfilm circuits for a broad range of commercial and military\napplications, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter\nand the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.\n    Net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 increased 45% to\n$19,009,000 from $13,070,000 in the comparable quarter in fiscal year\n2003. Net income amounted to $3,090,000, or approximately $0.38 per\ncommon share and $0.36 per common share assuming dilution, for the\nquarter ended June 30, 2004, compared with a net loss of $210,000, or\napproximately ($0.03) per common share and common share assuming\ndilution, for the comparable quarter ended June 30, 2003.\n    Net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 increased 25% to\n$61,183,000 from $49,048,000 in fiscal year 2003. Net income amounted\nto $2,176,000, or approximately $0.27 per common share and $0.25 per\ncommon share assuming dilution, for the fiscal year ended June 30,\n2004, compared with a net loss of $501,000, or approximately ($0.06)\nper common share and common share assuming dilution, for the fiscal\nyear ended June 30, 2003.\n    Management stated that the significant improvement in sales was\ndue to both improved business conditions and increased market share\nacross all product lines and in all of the markets the Company serves,\nparticularly the wireless infrastructure and semiconductor equipment\nmarkets. The wireless infrastructure market traditionally has been the\nCompany\'s largest market. Profit improvements were also driven by\ngross profit margin increases which resulted primarily from the\nability to run production at higher more efficient volumes, in part\ndue to the reengineering efforts previously implemented by the\nCompany, and comparatively lower inventory reserve requirements as a\nresult of the significant increase in bookings.\n    Bookings for the fourth quarter increased to $20,336,000, an\nincrease of 9% over the immediately preceding quarter, and an increase\nof 77% over the comparable period in the previous fiscal year.\nBookings for the full year increased 34% over the prior fiscal year.\nImprovement was evident in most of the Company\'s major product lines\nand markets, particularly in the wireless infrastructure and\nsemiconductor equipment markets.\n    Victor Insetta, President and Chief Executive Officer of the\nCompany, stated, "We are very pleased with the results for the quarter\nand the full year. Our program of investments has improved our\ncustomer service and product delivery capabilities. This, in turn, has\nenabled us to meet our customers\' requirements as demand in our core\nmarkets surged."\n    Mr. Insetta added, "Bookings have increased in each of the last\nfour quarters over the sequential quarter. When periods of rapid\ngrowth follow an extended downturn, customers tend to balance their\ninventories and production lines. While we expect that this will\nresult in lower bookings and net sales in the first quarter compared\nto last quarter which, in turn, will diminish our first quarter\'s\nresults, we also expect our first quarter\'s bookings and net sales to\nbe up substantially compared to the comparable quarter in the prior\nfiscal year. We foresee improvements in bookings and sales as the year\nprogresses. In short, we believe fiscal year 2005 will be a good year\nfor ATC."\n    The Company invites you to participate in its upcoming conference\ncall with management.
