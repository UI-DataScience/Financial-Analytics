(ticker symbol:\nLEH) today reported net income of $505 million for the third quarter ended\nAugust 31, 2004, or $1.71 per common share (diluted), versus net income of $480\nmillion, or $1.81 per common share (diluted) for the third quarter of fiscal\n2003. Second quarter 2004 net income was $609 million, or $2.01 per common share\n(diluted).\n\nFor the first nine months of 2004, net income was a record $1.8 billion, or\n$5.94 per common share (diluted), increases of 46% and 28%, respectively, from\n$1.2 billion, or $4.63 per common share (diluted) for the comparable period of\n2003.\n\n                               Business Highlights\n\no        Earned net income in excess of $500 million for third straight quarter\n\no        Achieved record net income and net revenues for the first nine months\n         of 2004; greater than full-year 2003's results\n\no        Ranked No. 1 by Greenwich Associates for overall quality of Fixed\n         Income sales, trading and research for the fourth consecutive year\n\n", u'\n\n\no        Ranked No. 1 in Institutional Investor\'s "2004 All-America Fixed Income\n         Research Team" survey for the fifth year in a row\n\no        Achieved market share gains in calendar 2004 in key investment banking\n         products, including M&A advisory and global equity origination\n\no        Named a qualified foreign institutional investor in China, which will\n         allow the Firm to trade yuan-denominated securities\n\nRichard S. Fuld, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Our\nbusinesses performed well during the third quarter, despite the pressures of a\nmore challenging market environment. With revenues and net income for the first\nnine months of 2004 already ahead of our full-year 2003 results, we are on our\nway to another outstanding year."\n\nNet revenues (total revenues less interest expense) for the third quarter rose\n12% to $2.6 billion, up from $2.3 billion in the third quarter of 2003, and down\n10% from $2.9 billion in the second quarter of 2004. Capital Markets revenues\nrose 2% compared with the third quarter of 2003, reflecting a 16% rise in Fixed\nIncome Capital Markets, partially offset by a 33% decline in Equities Capital\nMarkets.Fixed Income Capital Markets revenues remained resilient, due in part to\nrobust mortgage and asset-backed securitization activity, which helped offset\nreduced activity in investment grade debt and interest rate products. Equities\nCapital Markets revenues were impacted by low trading volumes and volatility, as\nwell as a valuation decline in the global equity markets, which were adversely\naffected by geopolitical concerns, higher oil prices, mixed economic data and\nthe seasonal summer slowdown. Investment Banking revenues rose 16% from the\nthird quarter of 2003, driven by increased equity and debt origination fees and\nenhanced levels of M&A advisory activity. Revenues from Client Services rose 75%\nfrom the same quarter last year, reflecting the positive impact of the\nacquisition of Neuberger Berman.\n\nFor the first nine months of 2004, net revenues increased 37%, to a record $8.7\nbillion, from $6.3 billion for the first nine months of 2003.\n\nNon-interest expenses for the quarter were $1.9 billion, compared to $1.6\nbillion in the 2003 third quarter and $2.0 billion in the trailing quarter of\n2004. Compensation and benefits as a percentage of net revenues was 49.8% during\nthe third quarter of 2004, compared to 50.0% during the third quarter of 2003\nand 49.8% in the second quarter of 2004. Non-personnel expenses in the 2004\nthird quarter were $594 million, compared with $424 million in the\n\n                                       2\n', u'\n\nprevious year\'s third quarter, largely reflecting a number of acquisitions\ncompleted subsequent to the third quarter of 2003. Non-personnel expenses were\n$585 million in the second quarter of 2004.\n\nFor the quarter ended August 31, 2004, the Firm\'s pretax margin was 27.6%,\ncompared to 31.9% in the 2003 third quarter. For the 2004 third quarter, the\nFirm\'s return on average common equity was 15.0%, compared to 20.7% in the 2003\nthird quarter, and return on average tangible common equity was 20.9% for the\nthird quarter of 2004, compared with 21.2% in the third quarter of 2003.\n\nAs of August 31, 2004, Lehman Brothers stockholders\' equity totaled $14.4\nbillion, and total capital (stockholders\' equity and long-term debt) was\napproximately $64.5 billion.

(See the reconciliation on page 10.) For the\n     quarter ended November 30, 2003 average common stockholders\' equity was\n     appropriately weighted for the effect of the equity issued in connection\n     with the Neuberger Berman Inc. acquisition on October 31, 2003. For the\n     quarter ended February 29, 2004 return on average common stockholders\'\n     equity was reduced by 0.4% as a result of the real estate charge.\n(d)  Return on average tangible common stockholders\' equity is computed by\n     dividing annualized net income applicable to common stock for the period by\n     average tangible common stockholders\' equity. Tangible common stockholders\'\n     equity equals total common stockholders\' equity less identifiable\n     intangible assets and goodwill. (See the reconciliation on page 10.) For\n     the quarter ended November 30, 2003 average tangible common stockholders\'\n     equity was appropriately weighted for the effect of the equity issued in\n     connection with the Neuberger Berman Inc. acquisition on October 31, 2003.\n     Management believes average tangible common stockholders\' equity is a\n     meaningful measure because it reflects the common stockholders\' equity\n     deployed in the Company\'s businesses. For the quarter ended February 29,\n     2004 return on average tangible common stockholders\' equity was reduced by\n     0.5% as a result of the real estate charge.\n(e)  Pretax margin for the quarter ended February 29, 2004 was reduced by\n     approximately 0.6% as a result of the real estate charge.\n(f)  The effective tax rate for the quarter ended February 29, 2004 was reduced\n     by approximately 0.2% as a result of the real estate charge.\n(g)  Net assets represents total assets excluding cash and securities segregated\n     and on deposit for regulatory and other purposes, secured financing\n     arrangements, collateral received recognized in inventory pursuant to SFAS\n     140 and identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. (See the\n     reconciliation on page 12.) Net leverage is defined as net assets divided\n     by tangible equity capital. (See the reconciliation on page 12.) The\n     Company believes net assets and net leverage are useful to investors when\n     comparing companies in the securities industry because they exclude certain\n     assets considered to have a low risk profile. The Company believes tangible\n     equity capital to be a more meaningful measure of the Company\'s equity for\n     purposes of calculating net leverage because the Company does not view the\n     amount of equity used to support identifiable intangible assets and\n     goodwill as available to support the Company\'s remaining net assets. Net\n     leverage, as so defined, is used by many of the Company\'s creditors and a\n     leading rating agency. These measures as presented by the Company are not\n     necessarily comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other\n     companies in the securities industry because of different methods of\n     calculation.\n(h)  At August 31, 2004, May 31, 2004 and February 29, 2004, long-term debt\n     includes $1,000 million, $1,385 million and $1,310 million, respectively,\n     of junior subordinated debt issued to trusts that prior to February 29,\n     2004 was classified as preferred securities subject to mandatory\n     redemption. On and after February 29, 2004 these amounts are classified as\n     long-term debt pursuant to the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 46,\n     Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities - an interpretation of ARB No.\n     51 ("FIN 46"). See "Management\'s Discussion and Analysis--New Accounting\n     Developments" and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the\n     Company\'s 2003 Annual Report to Stockholders. The junior subordinated debt\n     issued to trusts at August 31, 2004, May 31, 2004 and February 29, 2004 and\n     the preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption at the prior\n     period ends are collectively referred to hereinafter as junior subordinated\n     debt.\n(i)  On October 31, 2003, the Company acquired Neuberger Berman Inc. for a net\n     purchase price of $2,788 million, including cash consideration and\n     incidental costs of $690 million, equity consideration of $2,374 million\n     and excluding net cash and short-term investments acquired of $276 million.\n(j)  The Company believes total stockholders\' equity plus junior subordinated\n     debt to be a more meaningful measure of the Company\'s equity because the\n     junior subordinated debt is subordinated and has a maturity at issuance of\n     49 years and the Company can defer interest payments for up to 20\n     consecutive quarters if the junior subordinated debt is not in default. In\n     addition, a leading rating agency views these securities as equity capital\n     for purposes of calculating net leverage. (See the reconciliation on page\n     12.)\n(k)  Tangible equity capital is defined as total stockholders\' equity plus\n     junior subordinated debt less identifiable intangible assets and goodwill.\n     (See the reconciliation on page 12.) The Company believes tangible equity\n     capital to be a more meaningful measure of the Company\'s equity for\n     purposes of calculating net leverage because the Company does not view the\n     amount of equity used to support identifiable intangible assets and\n     goodwill as available to support the Company\'s remaining net assets.\n(l)  Total capital includes long-term debt (including junior subordinated debt)\n     and total stockholders\' equity. The Company believes total capital is\n     useful to investors as a measure of the Company\'s financial strength.\n(m)  The book value per common share calculation includes amortized restricted\n     stock units granted under stock award programs, which have been included in\n     total stockholders\' equity.\n(n)  Gross leverage is defined as total assets divided by total stockholders\'\n     equity.\n\n\n                                       6\n', u'\n\n\nLEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME\n(Preliminary and Unaudited)\n(In millions, except per share data)\n\n                                                              Three Months Ended                     % Change from\n                                                 ------------------------------------------     -------------------------\n\n                                                   Aug 31,        May 31,          Aug 31,        May 31,       Aug 31,\n                                                    2004           2004            2003           2004           2003\n                                                 -----------    -----------      ----------     ----------    -----------\n\nRevenues:\n   Principal transactions                            $1,217         $1,479          $1,200  (a)\n   Investment banking                                   526            546             453  (a)\n   Commissions                                          348            407             314\n   Interest and dividends                             2,769          2,609           2,467\n   Asset management and other                           191            187              29  (a)\n                                                 -----------    -----------      ----------\n\n      Total revenues                                  5,051          5,228           4,463\n   Interest expense                                   2,428          2,302           2,116\n\n                                                 -----------    -----------      ----------\n      Net revenues                                    2,623          2,926           2,347          (10)%            12%\n                                                 -----------    -----------      ----------\n\n\nNon-interest expenses:\n   Compensation and benefits                          1,306          1,457           1,174\n   Technology and communications                        195            185             150\n   Brokerage and clearance fees                         114            116              96\n   Occupancy                                            107            104              76\n   Professional fees                                     74             70              35\n   Business development                                  56             55              36\n   Other                                                 48             55              31\n                                                 -----------    -----------      ----------\n\n      Total non-interest expenses                     1,900          2,042           1,598           (7)%            19%\n                                                 -----------    -----------      ----------\n\n   Income before taxes and dividends on trust           723            884             749\n   preferred securities (b)\n   Provision for income taxes                           218            275             250\n   Dividends on trust preferred\n   securities (b)                                         -              -              19\n\n                                                 -----------    -----------      ----------\nNet income                                             $505           $609            $480          (17)%             5%\n                                                 ===========    ===========      ==========\nNet income applicable to common stock                  $487           $592            $469          (18)%             4%\n                                                 ===========    ===========      ==========\n\n\nEarnings per common share:\n   Basic                                              $1.79          $2.14           $1.92          (16)%           (7)%\n\n                                                 ===========    ===========      ==========\n   Diluted                                            $1.71          $2.01           $1.81          (15)%           (6)%\n                                                 ===========    ===========      ==========\n\n\n\n(a)  2003 reclassified to conform to the August 31, 2004 presentation.\n(b)  At February 29, 2004, preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption\n     were reclassified to junior subordinated debt (a component of long-term\n     debt) pursuant to the adoption of FIN 46.
