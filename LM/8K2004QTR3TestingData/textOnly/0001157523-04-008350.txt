In\nthe fourth quarter of 2003, the company did not conduct any\ninternational workshops.\n    Operating expenses for the quarter were $16.0 million compared to\n$9.8 million in 2003. The increase is directly attributable to the\nsignificantly higher sales. As a percent of sales operating expenses\ndecreased 6.9 percent to 64.1 percent of sales compared with 71.0\npercent in the fourth quarter of 2003, reflecting improving operating\nleverage and tight expense controls.\n    Earnings before income taxes (EBT) for the fiscal fourth quarter\nended June 30, 2004 more than tripled to $3.7 million from $1.2\nmillion in the same quarter of 2003. EBT per diluted share also\ntripled to $0.30 for the fourth quarter 2004 from $0.10 for the fourth\nquarter of 2003. Net income for the fiscal fourth quarter increased to\n$2.5 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to net income of\n$1.6 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the comparable quarter\nof the prior fiscal year.\n    Revenue for the year-ended June 30, 2004 grew to $81.0 million\ncompared to $46.5 million for the same period last year, representing\na 74 percent increase. EBT for the year-ended June 30, 2004 rose to\n$9.6 million from $5.0 million in the prior year, an increase of 91\npercent. EBT per diluted share was $0.79 for the year, an 80 percent\nincrease over $0.44 for the prior year. As a result of its strong\nearnings history, during the year iMergent recognized a $12.3 million\nnon-cash income tax benefit based on the reversal of the valuation\nallowance against its deferred tax asset, which consists mainly of net\noperating losses carried forward (NOL) from prior periods and largely\nreduces future tax burdens on cash. At June 30, 2004, the total\ndeferred tax asset was $13.1 million. As a result, net income for the\nyear-ended June 30, 2004 including the income tax benefit increased to\n$21.9 million, or $1.80 per diluted share, compared to $5.0 million,\nor $0.44 per diluted share, in the prior year.\n\n    Highlights\n\n    --  Began trading on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) on August\n        16th under the ticker "IIG," which will be celebrated when\n        iMergent\'s management team opens the stock exchange on\n        September 14th.\n\n    --  Increased the number of StoresOnline(TM) workshops held to 164\n        during the quarter and 544 during the year. The company\n        conducted 37 international workshops during the quarter and 58\n        during the year.\n\n    --  Expanded customer support services to include chat and email\n        24-hours a day, 7-days a week.\n\n    --  Added UPS OnLine(R) Tools to the StoresOnline(TM) platform\n        enabling merchants to reduce operating costs, increase\n        shipping efficiencies and improve customer service - for no\n        additional charge to the merchants. To use UPS OnLine Tools\n        merchants simply need to open a standard UPS shipping account\n        and activate their websites.\n\n    --  Extended international sales by visiting the United Kingdom\n        for the first time and returning to Australia, Canada, and New\n        Zealand.\n\n    --  In August, announced a new two-year, $5 million line of credit\n        with Bank One. The new line of credit replaces its previous\n        credit facility and will provide accessible working capital to\n        support the company\'s growth initiatives. The agreement allows\n        iMergent to borrow up to $5 million at LIBOR plus 2 percent.\n\n    Don Danks, chairman and chief executive officer, stated,\n"iMergent\'s management team is extremely pleased with our record\nfinancial growth, as well as our recent listing on the AMEX. We\nbelieve listing gives us another avenue to reach out globally to\ninstitutional investors who wish to participate in our growth. We look\nforward to utilizing AMEX\'s tremendous resources to help maximize\nshareholder value and increase the visibility of iMergent\'s future\nachievements, as we strive to be the pre-eminent supplier of\ne-commerce solutions to entrepreneurs and small business."\n    Brandon Lewis, president and chief operating officer, said,\n"During fiscal 2004, our record revenue and earnings prove we have\nsuccessfully executed our strategic plan to grow the business and\nincrease operating leverage. We have increased our sales team and its\nreach, while maintaining the same corporate infrastructure.\nConsequently, we were able to launch and then expand our international\nmarketing while raising our overall seminar profitability. In\naddition, we adopted UPS Online Tools and began a marketing\npartnership with MIT Financial. Following on the success of these\nmutually beneficial relationships, we are working to develop\nadditional distribution channels and significant marketing\npartnerships. In addition, we have established a number of new\nprograms to capture even more opportunities in our large and growing\nmarket."\n    Robert Lewis, chief financial officer, added, "We are implementing\nprograms to further raise sales productivity, leverage existing\ninfrastructure, reduce our bad debt expense and increase recurring\nrevenue. In addition to expanding our marketing resources, we continue\nto augment our customer service and add affiliate programs. We expect\nthese initiatives to increase the number of activated merchant\nwebsites, to further raise the value that every merchant brings to our\ncompany and to further improve our financial performance."\n\n    Conference Call\n\n    Management will hold a conference call to discuss these results on\nWednesday, September 8, 2004 at 4:30 p.m. ET; 1:30 p.m. PT.
