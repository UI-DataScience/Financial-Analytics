Williams\nChief Financial Officer\nInn of the Mountain Gods Resort and Casino\nTele:  (505) 464-7705\nEmail:  rwilliams@imgresort.com\n\nMescalero, New Mexico--(BUSINESS WIRE) Sept. 9, 2004--Inn of the Mountain Gods\nResort and Casino ("IMGRC"), a business enterprise of the Mescalero Apache Tribe\n(the "Tribe"), reported today that net revenue for its fiscal quarter ended July\n31, 2004 was $22.1 million, an increase of $4.3 million, or 24.2%, from $17.8\nmillion for the prior year first fiscal quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter\nended July 31, 2004 was $8.6 million, an increase of $1.5 million, or 21.1%,\nfrom $7.1 million for the prior year period.\n\nThe increase in net revenue was primarily attributable to a growth in gaming\nrevenue during the period, which was 12.8% higher than last year\'s first fiscal\nquarter, as well as a continuing increase in revenue from retail operations\nlocated at the Travel Center, which opened in May 2003. For the quarter ended\nJuly 31, 2004, the average gross slot win per unit per day was $157 (on a\nweighted average number of slot machines of 1,181) versus last year\'s first\nquarter of $166 (on a weighted average number of slot machines of 1,000). The\naverage table game win per unit per day for the period was $638 (on a weighted\naverage number of table games of 38) versus last year\'s first quarter of $565\n(on the same weighted average number of table games). The increase in retail\nrevenue reflects year over year increases in the sales from refueling stations\nand smoke shop which offer favorable product pricing relative to other\ncompetitors and to the operation of our convenience store.\n\nMichael French, Chief Operating Officer of IMGRC, in commenting on the\nperformance stated: "We were very pleased with the increases in revenue in the\nfirst quarter especially since we are now on a comparable basis with last year.\nWe are also encouraged by the year over year improvement in operating margins in\nour food and beverage, retail and recreational segments. The momentum that we\nare building is beneficial as we approach the opening of our new resort\nfacilities." Mr. French went onto to say, "Our focus continues to be on the\non-time opening of the new resort and the effective transition of the old casino\noperations."\n\nConstruction of IMGRC\'s new resort and casino is on schedule. Construction costs\nincurred on the new resort\'s fixed price contract through July 31, 2004 were\n$113 million leaving the remaining costs to be incurred of $22 million prior to\nthe opening in April 2005. In addition, there are previously announced scope\nchanges totaling $5 million relating to the build out of additional guest rooms,\nmeeting rooms and a fitness center and indoor swimming pool which will be\ncompleted by the opening in April 2005. IMGRC has been informed that funds\nrelative to an application filed with the federal government for cost\nreimbursement for school construction is expected to be received by the Tribe\ntoday. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the bonds issued by\nIMGRC, $10 million of these funds will be contributed by the Tribe to the\nconstruction reserve account for construction costs for the new resort.\n\nABOUT INN OF THE MOUNTAIN GODS RESORT AND CASINO\n\nIMGRC is a business enterprise of the Tribe, a federally recognized Indian tribe\nwith an approximately 725-square mile reservation situated in the Sacramento\nMountains in south-central New Mexico. IMGRC includes all of the resort\nenterprises of the Tribe including Casino Apache, Casino Apache Travel Center,\nSki Apache and a new resort project, currently under construction which, upon\ncompletion, will include a 273-room hotel, a new 38,000 square foot casino\n(replacing the existing Casino Apache), a fitness center and indoor swimming\npool and a 37,000 square foot convention and special events center, which will\ninclude capacity for 17,000 square feet of divisible meeting room space.\n\n', u'\n\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nIn this press release, IMGRC makes references to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted\nEBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization and further adjusted to exclude (i) pre-opening costs and expenses\nrelated to construction of IMGRC\'s new resort and casino, (ii) revenue sharing\nand regulatory fees in excess of those payable under the Tribe\'s new compact and\n(iii) other income. IMGRC is an instrumentality of a sovereign Indian tribe and\nis not subject to federal or state income tax. IMGRC cautions investors that\namounts presented in accordance with its definition of adjusted EBITDA may not\nbe comparable to similar measures disclosed by other issuers, because not all\nissuers and analysts calculate adjusted EBITDA in the same manner.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA provide an additional way to view IMGRC\'s operations and, when\nviewed with both the GAAP results and reconciliation to net income, IMGRC\nbelieves provides a more complete understanding of its business than could be\nobtained absent this disclosure. Adjusted EBITDA is presented solely as a\nsupplemental disclosure because (i) IMGRC believes it enhances an overall\nunderstanding of IMGRC\'s past and current financial performance; (ii) IMGRC\nbelieves it is a useful tool for investors to assess the operating performance\nof the business in comparison to other operators within the gaming industry\nbecause adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items that may not be indicative of\nIMGRC\'s operating results; (iii) measures that are comparable to adjusted EBITDA\nare often used as an important basis for the valuation of gaming companies; and\n(iv) IMGRC adjusted EBITDA internally to evaluate the performance of its\noperating personnel and also as a benchmark to evaluate its operating\nperformance in comparison to its competitors.\n\nThe use of adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations. Adjusted EBITDA should be\nconsidered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, any GAAP\nfinancial measure including net income (as an indicator of IMGRC\'s performance)\nor cash flows provided by operating activities (as an indicator of IMGRC\'s\nliquidity), nor should it be considered as an indicator of IMGRC\'s overall\nfinancial performance. Adjusted EBITDA eliminate certain substantial recurring\nitems from net income, such as depreciation and amortization and interest\nexpense. Each of these items has been incurred in the past, will continue to be\nincurred in the future and should be considered in the overall evaluation of\nIMGRC\'s results. IMGRC compensates for these limitations by providing the\nrelevant disclosure of depreciation and amortization, interest expense and other\nitems excluded in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA both in its reconciliation\nto the GAAP financial measure of net income and in its consolidated financial\nstatements, all of which should be considered when evaluating its results. IMGRC\nstrongly encourages investors to review its financial information in its\nentirety and not to rely on a single financial measure. A reconciliation of\nadjusted EBITDA to net income is included in the selected financial information\nthat accompanies this press release.\n\nCONFERENCE CALL\n\nIMGRC will discuss its first quarter results during a conference call on\nSeptember 10, 2004, at 11:00 a.m. (EST). The call can be accessed via telephone\nby dialing (913) 981-5559 and providing the confirmation code 953431. Interested\nparties should call at least ten minutes prior to the start of the conference\ncall to register.\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nSome information included in this press release contains forward-looking\nstatements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and\nSection 21E of the Securities Act of 1934.

Pursuant to the settlement\n     agreement, during the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Tribe signed a\n     gaming compact calling for the Tribe to pay the State of New Mexico revenue\n     sharing fees of 8.0% of the "net win" from gaming machines and regulatory\n     fees of $100,000 per year. Adjusted EBITDA adjusts results for the fiscal\n     quarter ending July 31, 2003 to reflect revenue sharing and regulatory fees\n     at the levels in the new compact.\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n\n\n\n                   INN OF THE MOUNTAIN GODS RESORT AND CASINO\n\n          (AN UNINCORPORATED ENTERPRISE OF THE MESCALERO APACHE TRIBE)\n\n                        CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME\n                             (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)\n\n', u'\n', u'\n                                                                 QUARTER ENDED JULY 31,\n                                                     -----------------------------------------------\n\n                                                             2004                      2003\n                                                     ---------------------     ---------------------\n                                                            (UNAUDITED)              (UNAUDITED)\n', u' ', u' ', u'\nRevenues\n  Gaming                                                          $17,646                   $15,600\n  Food and beverage                                                 1,413                     1,237\n  Recreation, retail, & other                                       3,331                     1,242\n                                                     ---------------------     ---------------------\n     Gross revenues                                                22,390                    18,079\n      Less - promotional allowances                                   262                       254\n                                                     ---------------------     ---------------------\n        Net revenue                                                22,128                    17,825\n\n  Operating expenses                                               15,979                    14,338\n                                                     ---------------------     ---------------------\n\nIncome (loss) from operations                                       6,149                     3,487\n                                                     ---------------------     ---------------------\n\nOther income (expense):\n  Interest income                                                     210                        13\n  Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized                    (2,931)                         -\n  Other income                                                        102                        66\n                                                     ---------------------     ---------------------\n     Total other income                                           (2,619)                        79\n                                                     ---------------------     ---------------------\n\n     Net income (loss)                                            $ 3,530                   $ 3,566\n                                                     =====================     =====================\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n-----END PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE-----\n']
