Third quarter revenues were $155.8 million in 2004 compared to $151.6\nmillion in 2003. Net earnings improved to $5.0 million or $.14 per diluted\nshare in the current period compared to net earnings of $3.5 million or $.10\nper diluted share in the third quarter of 2003. For the nine months, revenues\nincreased 5.9% to $434.8 million from $410.4 million in 2003. Net earnings\nimproved to $10.1 million or $.28 per diluted share compared to net earnings of\n$5.6 million or $.16 per diluted share in 2003.\n\n         Homi B. Patel, chairman and chief executive officer of Hartmarx,\ncommented, "We are executing well, achieving sales and earnings increases,\nimproved operating margins and significant debt reduction from efficient\nworking capital management. For the full year, we continue to expect a sales\nincrease in the mid single digits. As a result of anticipating a favorable\nimpact of $.02 to $.03 per diluted share to fourth quarter earnings from the\nMisook acquisition, we are once again increasing our estimate for full year\nearnings from a 50% increase over last year to a 55% - 60% increase. Total debt\nof $132.5 million at August 31 declined $23.6 million or 15.1% from the year\nearlier level, even after reflecting the $32.1 million cash payment related to\nthe Misook acquisition," Mr. Patel concluded.\n\n         Third quarter operating earnings were $9.8 million in 2004 compared to\n$7.9 million in 2003. The Misook business contributed $.01 to third quarter\nearnings per diluted share. For the nine months, operating earnings improved to\n$21.3 million from $15.9 million in 2003. The increase reflected the sales\nimprovement, including approximately $4 million from the Misook business, along\nwith a higher year-to-date gross margin rate of 30.6% compared to 29.5% in\n2003. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $6.5 million on\nthe higher sales, including the Misook business, representing 26.1% of sales\ncompared to 26.0% in 2003.\n\n         Interest expense for the nine months declined to $4.6 million from\n$5.5 million in 2003, principally from lower average borrowing levels.\nYear-to-date results for 2003 also included a $.8 million first quarter pre-tax\nrefinancing charge associated with the January, 2003 early retirement of the\nthen outstanding 12.5% senior unsecured notes, representing the non-cash\nwrite-off of unamortized debt discount and financing fees.\n\n\n                                  - - MORE - -\n\n', u'\n\n         Hartmarx produces and markets business, casual and golf apparel under\nits own brands including Hart Schaffner Marx, Hickey-Freeman, Palm Beach,\nCoppley, Cambridge, Keithmoor, Racquet Club, Naturalife, Pusser\'s of the West\nIndies, Royal, Brannoch, Riserva, Sansabelt, Exclusively Misook, Barrie Pace\nand Hawksley & Wight.
