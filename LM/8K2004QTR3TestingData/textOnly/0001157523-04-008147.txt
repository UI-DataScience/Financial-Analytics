(Nasdaq:CATS), a developer and marketer of\nprogrammable and analog mixed signal products used in\ntelecommunications, networking systems, computation, automotive,\nindustrial and consumer markets, today reported financial results for\nits fiscal first quarter ended July 31, 2004.\n    For the fiscal first quarter ended July 31, 2004, Catalyst had net\nincome of $2.2 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, on revenues of\n$16.7 million. This compares with net income of $920,000, or $0.05 per\ndiluted share, on revenues of $13.8 million in the quarter ended July\n31, 2003. In the quarter ended April 30, 2004, Catalyst reported net\nincome of $5.6 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, on revenues of\n$16.8 million.\n    Revenues from analog/mixed signal products were $766,000, or 4.6%\nof revenues, in the quarter ended July 31, 2004, compared with\n$277,000, or 2.0% of revenues, in the quarter ended July 31, 2003 and\n$490,000, or 2.9% of revenues, in the quarter ended April 30, 2004.\n    Gross margin for the quarter ended July 31, 2004 was 51.9%,\ncompared to 37.2% for the quarter ended July 31, 2003 and 49.0% for\nthe quarter ended April 30, 2004. First quarter sales reflected a\nbetter mix of new products and included increased sales of less\nexpensive inventory purchased in previous quarters.\n    Catalyst recorded tax expense of $1.3 million, or 37% of net\nincome before taxes during the quarter ended July 31, 2004. This\ncompares to an income tax expense of $162,000 in the quarter ended\nJuly 31, 2003 and a tax benefit of $2.2 million in the quarter ended\nApril 30, 2004.\n    Research & Development and Sales, General and Administrative\nexpenses increased 38% and 21%, respectively, from the quarter ended\nJuly 31, 2003. Research & Development and Sales, General and\nAdministrative expenses both increased 7% from the quarter ended April\n30, 2004, reflecting increased efforts to develop and promote emerging\nanalog/mixed signal products.\n    As of July 31, 2004, Catalyst had cash, cash equivalents and\nshort-term investments of $45.8 million, an increase of $12.0 million\ncompared to the previous quarter as $8.0 million of cash was raised in\na secondary common stock offering. Additionally, the company received\n$369,000 from stock option exercises and $3.6 million was generated by\noperations.\n    Catalyst also announced today that its Board of Directors\nauthorized the repurchase in open market transactions from time to\ntime of an additional 1,000,000 shares, or an aggregate of 3,000,000\nshares. To date, Catalyst has repurchased approximately 1.5 million\nshares under this program.\n\n    Management Comments & Outlook\n\n    "Our efforts to target higher margin sales opportunities have\nresulted in a near record quarterly gross margin of 51.9%. Also\ncontributing to this was the lower cost inventories that we had\nacquired earlier and an increase in revenues from our analog/mixed\nsignal products. It is encouraging to see the progress being made in\ngrowing the revenues from our analog/mixed signal products but this\nproduct line is still emerging and is subject to quarterly variations\nin its growth rate," said Gelu Voicu, president and chief executive\nofficer. "Nevertheless, as fab capacities have tightened we expect\ngross margins to be under pressure."\n\n    Investor Conference Call\n\n    Catalyst will conduct a conference call regarding the first fiscal\nquarter results beginning at 2:00 p.m. (Pacific Time) today.
