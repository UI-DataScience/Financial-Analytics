(the "Registrant" or the "company") issued a news\nrelease to announce its financial  results for the first quarter ended August 1,\n2004. The news release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99(a).\n\nAlso on August 26, 2004, the Registrant released a Financial Information Release\ncontaining   additional   financial   information  and  disclosures   about  the\nRegistrant\'s  first  quarter  ended August 1, 2004.  The  Financial  Information\nRelease is attached hereto as Exhibit 99(b).\n\nThe news release and Financial  Information  Release contain  disclosures  about\nproforma  income  statement  information,  which  reconciles the reported income\nstatement  information with proforma  results,  which exclude  restructuring and\nrelated   charges  and  credits.   The  company  has  included   this   proforma\ninformation in order to show  operational  performance  excluding the effects of\nrestructuring  and related  charges and credits  that are not  expected to occur\non  a  regular  basis.   Management  believes  this  presentation  aids  in  the\ncomparison of financial results among comparable financial periods.\n\n\nForward  Looking  Information.  This  Report and the  exhibits  attached  hereto\ncontain  statements that may be deemed  "forward-looking  statements" within the\nmeaning  of the  federal  securities  laws,  including  the  Private  Securities\nLitigation  Reform Act of 1995  (Section 27A of the  Securities  Act of 1933 and\nSection 27A of the  Securities  and Exchange Act of 1934).  Such  statements are\ninherently  subject  to  risks  and  uncertainties.   Further,  forward  looking\nstatements  are  intended  to speak  only as of the date on which they are made.\nForward-looking statements are statements that include projections, expectations\nor beliefs  about future  events or results or otherwise  are not  statements of\nhistorical  fact.  Such  statements  are often but not always  characterized  by\nqualifying words such as "expect,"  "believe,"  "estimate," "plan" and "project"\nand their  derivatives,  and  include but are not  limited to  statements  about\nexpectations for the company\'s  future sales,  gross profit and operating income\nmargins,  SG&A or other expenses and earnings.  Factors that could influence the\nmatters  discussed in such  statements  include the level of housing  starts and\nsales of existing homes,  consumer confidence,  trends in disposable income, and\ngeneral economic conditions. Decreases in these economic indicators could have a\nnegative effect on the company\'s business and prospects.  Likewise, increases in\ninterest rates, particularly home mortgage rates, and increases in consumer debt\nor the  general  rate of  inflation,  could  affect the  company  adversely.  In\naddition,  strengthening of the U. S. dollar against other currencies could make\nthe company\'s products less competitive on the basis of price in markets outside\nthe United States.  Also,  economic and political  instability in  international\nareas could affect the company\'s  operations or sources of goods in those areas,\nas well as demand for the company\'s products in international markets.  Finally,\nunanticipated delays or costs in executing restructuring actions could cause the\ncumulative  effect of  restructuring  actions to fail to meet the objectives set\nforth by  management.  Other factors that could affect the matters  discussed in\nforward looking  statements are included in the company\'s periodic reports filed\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nItem 9.01 (c) -- Exhibits\n\n99(a)  News Release dated August 26, 2004\n\n99(b)  Financial Information Release dated August 26, 2004\n\n\n\n', u'\n\n\n\n\n\n                                   SIGNATURE\n\n\nPursuant  to the  requirements  of the  Securities  Exchange  Act of  1934,  the\nRegistrant  has duly  caused  this  report  to be  signed  on its  behalf by the\nundersigned hereunto duly authorized.\n\n\n                                    CULP, INC.\n                                    (Registrant)\n\n\n                              By:    Franklin  N.

(August 26, 2004) - Culp,  Inc.  (NYSE:  CFI) today  reported\nfinancial  and  operating  results  for the first  quarter of fiscal  2005 ended\nAugust 1, 2004. The highlights include:\n\no     Mattress  fabrics  segment  average  weekly  sales  up 2.7  percent during\n      period of transition to one-sided mattresses.\n\no     Aggressive  expansion  of  offshore  sourcing  capabilities,  resulting in\n      sales of  sourced  upholstery  fabrics  more  than  doubling over the same\n      period last year.\n\no     Long-term   debt-to-capital  ratio  of  33.3  percent compared  with  44.5\n      percent a year ago.\n\no     Earnings  expectation  for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 is net income\n      of $0.13 to $0.17 per diluted share.\n\nOverview\n\nFor the three months ended August 1, 2004, net sales were $67.8 million compared\nwith  $73.7  million a year ago, a 7.9  percent  decline.  The first  quarter of\nfiscal  2005  included 13 weeks  versus 14 weeks for the same  quarter of fiscal\n2004. The company reported a net loss of $1,052,000, or $0.09 per diluted share,\nfor the first quarter of fiscal 2005  compared  with a net loss of $411,000,  or\n$0.04 per  diluted  share,  for the first  quarter  of  fiscal  2004.  Excluding\nrestructuring and related charges and credits of approximately  $42,000,  net of\nincome taxes,  the net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 was $1,094,000,\nor $0.09 per diluted share.\n\n"Considering  one less  week\'s  sales,  our average  weekly  sales for the first\nfiscal  quarter  of 2005 were $5.2  million  compared  with $5.3  million in the\nprior-year  period,  a decrease of less than 1.0 percent,"  commented  Robert G.\nCulp, III,  chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Culp, Inc. "The\nfirst  quarter of our fiscal year is typically  the slowest  period for Culp and\nthe furniture  industry with scheduled  plant vacation  shutdowns.  The seasonal\nslowdown,  combined with the continued weakness in consumer demand for furniture\nthroughout  the  summer,   accounted  for  this  modest  drop.  We  believe  our\ncompetitive position is strong and we are excited about the growth opportunities\nin our mattress ticking business and our offshore sourcing strategy."\n\nMattress Fabrics Segment\n\nMattress  fabric (known as mattress  ticking) sales were $26.0 million  compared\nwith $27.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2004, a 4.7 percent  decline.\nAs noted,  these results  reflect a 13-week  period versus a 14-week period last\nyear.  Average  weekly  sales for the  first  quarter  of fiscal  2005 were $2.0\nmillion compared with $1.9 million in the prior-year  period, an increase of 2.7\npercent.  This  increase is especially  noteworthy  considering  our  customers\'\nrecent transition to one-sided mattresses,  which utilize one-third less fabric.\nOperating  income for this segment was $2.9  million,  or 11.2 percent of sales,\ncompared with $4.1 million, or 15.2 percent of sales, for the prior-year period.\nOperating income was primarily affected by one week\'s less sales for the quarter\nand inventory markdowns related to certain customer programs.  These factors are\nexpected to have  significantly  less  impact on the  segment\'s  second  quarter\nresults.\n\nCulp remarked,  "We are seeing positive trends in our mattress  ticking business\nand  continue  to  make  gains  with  key  customers.  Consumer  trends  and the\nattractiveness  of this product  category for retailers  favor further growth in\nbedding demand, and we believe that Culp is well positioned to benefit from this\ngrowth  as  a  leading  provider  of  mattress  ticking.  Additionally,   unlike\nupholstery  fabrics,  the mattress  fabric  business is not being  threatened by\nAsian  imports  because of the  relatively  low average  price  points and labor\ncontent and the just-in-time  delivery  requirements of this business.  Further,\nAsian imports of finished mattresses have been limited to less than four percent\nof the U.S.  market  because of high  shipping  costs as well as the  customized\nproduct lines and strong brand name recognition associated with mattresses. With\nour  leadership  in product  design,  superior  customer  service  and  delivery\nperformance,  and a globally  competitive  cost  structure,  we expect  that the\nmattress  ticking  business will account for an increasing  percentage of Culp\'s\noverall sales and profitability in fiscal 2005."\n\nUpholstery Fabrics Segment\n\nSales for this segment were $41.9 million,  a 9.8 percent decline  compared with\n$46.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.  Average weekly sales for the\nfirst quarter of fiscal 2005 were $3.2 million compared with $3.3 million in the\nprior year  period,  a decrease  of 2.9  percent.  Sales of  upholstery  fabrics\nreflect soft demand by furniture retailers during the summer months.  Additional\nfactors  affecting the demand for  upholstery  fabrics are the current  consumer\npreference  for  leather  furniture  and  increased  competition  from  imported\nfabrics, including cut and sewn kits, primarily from Asia.\n\n"It has  become  increasingly  evident  that  competitive  forces in the  global\nmarketplace  are  significantly  changing  the  face  of the  furniture  and the\nupholstery fabrics industries," added Culp.  "However,  we believe that Culp has\nmade  significant  progress in adapting our business  model to take advantage of\nthis  transition and position  ourselves more  effectively in this  environment.\nFirst,  we  have   significantly   adjusted  our  cost  structure  and  domestic\nmanufacturing  capacity over the past several years.  Second, we have focused on\ndesign  creativity and product  development to provide breadth and innovation in\nthe fabrics  offered to our  customers to meet  changing  consumer  preferences.\nThird,  we have  implemented a dual strategy to  aggressively  develop  offshore\nsourcing  capabilities  for Culp.  In fiscal 2003 we put in place the  necessary\nresources to begin sourcing from Asia certain  upholstery fabrics that we do not\nmanufacture,  and we  have  continued  to  expand  these  resources.  The  other\ncomponent of Culp\'s offshore sourcing strategy is our China operation,  where we\nare now well underway with our manufacturing operations and our fabric shipments\nto  customers.  Sales  of  upholstery  fabrics  produced  outside  of  our  U.S.\nmanufacturing  plants, which include the popular micro-denier suedes and fabrics\nproduced at our China facility,  accounted for  approximately  $5.5 million,  or\n13.1 percent,  of  upholstery  fabric  sales for the  quarter.  Sourced  fabrics\naccounted for  approximately  $2.1 million,  or 4.5 percent of upholstery fabric\nsales for the same period last year."\n\nOperating  loss for the  upholstery  fabrics  segment was $2.6  million,  or 6.1\npercent of sales, compared with a loss of $1.7 million, or 3.7 percent of sales,\nfor the same period last year. The segment loss in each period was primarily due\nto underutilization of the company\'s U.S.  manufacturing  capacity.  Culp noted,\n"If sales continue to be under pressure in the upholstery  fabrics  segment,  we\nare prepared to take the necessary  actions to further adjust our cost structure\nand U.S. capacity, as we have demonstrated in recent years."\n\nBalance Sheet\n\n"One  of our  key  financial  objectives  for  fiscal  2005  is to  continue  to\ncapitalize on the strength of our balance sheet," added Culp. "At the end of the\nfirst fiscal quarter, our balance sheet reflects  approximately $12.0 million in\ncash and cash  equivalents.  Long-term debt now stands at $51.1 million compared\nwith $76.6 million a year ago. As a result, our long-term  debt-to-capital ratio\nis now 33.3 percent  compared with 44.5 percent a year ago. Our balance sheet is\nsound with  significantly  lower debt,  excellent  liquidity  and the  financial\nflexibility to pursue our strategic initiatives."\n\nOutlook\n\nCommenting  on the business  outlook,  Culp said,  "Mattress  ticking sales have\nalready picked up during the early part of our second  quarter.  For the current\nquarter,  we  expect  sales in this  segment  to be  moderately  ahead of second\nquarter sales last year and expect that operating  income will  approximate last\nyear\'s  level.  With  respect to the  upholstery  fabrics  segment,  the outlook\nremains  uncertain  for  a  sustained  recovery  in  retail  furniture  business\nconditions.  We are optimistic that upholstery fabric sales will also pick up in\nthe fall, as is seasonally  typical in the  furniture  industry.  For the second\nquarter, upholstery fabrics segment sales are expected to decrease less than the\nfirst quarter decline of 9.8 percent. While we do expect to be profitable in the\nupholstery fabrics segment, operating income will be down considerably from last\nyear\'s second quarter. At this time, we expect to report net income in the range\nof $0.13 to $0.17 per share diluted, with the actual results depending primarily\non the level of demand throughout the quarter.  We believe the excellence in our\ndesign creativity, the strength in our mattress ticking business, the aggressive\nexpansion of our offshore  sourcing  capabilities  and our sound  balance  sheet\neffectively position Culp in today\'s marketplace."\n\nCulp,  Inc.  is one of the world\'s  largest  marketers  of mattress  fabrics for\nbedding and  upholstery  fabrics for furniture.  The company\'s  fabrics are used\nprincipally in the production of bedding products and residential and commercial\nupholstered furniture.\n\nThis release contains statements that may be deemed "forward-looking statements"\nwithin  the  meaning of the  federal  securities  laws,  including  the  Private\nSecurities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995 (Section 27A of the Securities Act of\n1933  and  Section  27A of the  Securities  and  Exchange  Act  of  1934).

Other factors that could\naffect the matters discussed in  forward-looking  statements are included in the\ncompany\'s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\n\n                                   CULP, INC.\n                         Condensed Financial Highlights\n                                   (Unaudited)\n\n                                                        Three Months Ended\n                                                     -------------------------\n                                                      August 1,     August 3,\n                                                        2004          2003\n                                                     ------------ ------------\nNet sales                                            $67,849,000  $73,676,000\n                                                     ============ ============\nNet loss                                             $(1,052,000) $  (411,000)\n                                                     ============ ============\nBasic and diluted net loss per share:\n   Basic                                             $     (0.09) $     (0.04)\n   Diluted                                           $     (0.09) $     (0.04)\n                                                     ============ ============\nAverage shares outstanding:\n  Basic                                               11,547,000   11,515,000\n  Diluted                                             11,547,000   11,515,000\n\n\n          Reconciliation of Net Loss as Reported to Pro Forma Net Loss\n                                   (Unaudited)\n\n                                                        Three Months Ended\n                                                     -------------------------\n                                                      August 1,     August 3,\n                                                        2004          2003\n                                                     ------------ ------------\nNet loss, as reported                                $(1,052,000) $  (411,000)\nRestructuring and related charges (credits),\n  net of income taxes                                    (42,000)          -0-\n                                                     ------------ ------------\nPro forma net loss                                   $(1,094,000) $  (411,000)\n                                                     ============ ============\n\n\nReconciliation of Net Loss Per Share as Reported to Pro Forma Net Loss Per Share\n                                   (Unaudited)\n\n                                                        Three Months Ended\n                                                     -------------------------\n                                                      August 1,     August 3,\n                                                        2004          2003\n                                                     ------------ ------------\nNet loss per share, as reported                      $     (0.09)  $    (0.04)\nRestructuring and related charges (credits),\n  net of income taxes                                         -0-          -0-\n                                                     ------------ ------------\nPro forma net loss per share                         $     (0.09)  $    (0.04)\n                                                     ===========  ============\n\n                                   -END-\n\n\n', u'\nExhibit 99(b)\n\n                    CULP, INC.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION RELEASE\n                               FINANCIAL NARRATIVE\n          for the three months ended August 1, 2004 and August 3, 2003\n\n\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nHighlights for the first quarter ended August 1, 2004 , include:\n\no     Mattress  fabrics  segment  average  weekly  sales  up 2.7 percent  during\n      period of transition to one-sided mattresses.\n\no     Aggressive  expansion  of  offshore  sourcing  capabilities,  resulting in\n      sales  of sourced  upholstery fabrics  more than  doubling over  the  same\n      period last year.\n\no     Long-term debt-to-capital ratio of 33.3% compared with 44.5% a year ago.\n\no     Earnings  expectation for the second  quarter of fiscal 2005 is net income\n      of $0.13 to $0.17 per diluted share.\n\n\nGENERAL - The first quarter of the fiscal year is typically  the slowest  period\nfor the company and the  furniture  industry  due to  scheduled  plant  vacation\nshutdowns.  The  seasonal  slowdown,  combined  with the  continued  weakness in\nconsumer demand for furniture  throughout the summer,  accounted for this modest\ndrop. In addition,  the first quarter of fiscal 2005 included 13 weeks versus 14\nweeks for the same period of fiscal 2004.  For the first quarter of fiscal 2005,\nnet sales  decreased 7.9% to $67.8  million.  Average weekly sales for the first\nquarter of fiscal 2005 were $5.2 million compared with $5.3 million in the prior\nyear period,  a decrease of less than 1.0%.  The company  reported a net loss of\n$1,052,000, or $0.09 per share diluted, compared with a net loss of $411,000, or\n$0.04 per  share  diluted,  in the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  2004.  Excluding\nrestructuring and related charges and credits of approximately  $42,000,  net of\nincome taxes, the net loss for the quarter was $1,094,000.  These results are in\nline with the  previously  announced  guidance of an  expected  loss of $0.08 to\n$0.13 per share.\n\n\nSTATEMENT OF OPERATIONS COMMENTS\n\n\n     MATTRESS FABRICS SEGMENT (See page 5 - Sales, Gross Profit and Operating\n     Income (Loss) by Segment)\n\n     Net Sales -- Mattress  fabric  sales  (known as mattress  ticking)  for the\nfirst quarter of fiscal 2005 decreased 4.7% to $26.0 million compared with $27.2\nmillion for the same period a year ago. As noted above,  these results reflect a\n13 week period versus a 14 week period last year.  Average  weekly sales for the\nfirst quarter of fiscal 2005 were $2.0 million compared with $1.9 million in the\nprior year  period,  an increase of 2.7%.  While sales,  on a comparable  basis,\ncontinue  to be  affected  by the  recent  customers'  transition  to  one-sided\nmattresses,  which utilize  one-third less fabric,  the mattress ticking segment\nexperienced higher sales, on an average weekly basis, by expanding business with\ncertain key accounts.  Also,  mattress  manufacturers  are  currently  incurring\nhigher  costs for other  mattress  components,  such as steel,  as well as costs\nassociated  with flame  retardant  requirements.  As a result of these increased\ncosts,  mattress  manufacturers  are  placing  additional  pressure  on mattress\nticking prices,  and in some instances  manufacturers are moving to lower priced\nticking.\n\nMattress  ticking  yards sold during the first  quarter of fiscal 2005 were 10.8\nmillion  compared with 10.5 million yards in the first quarter of last year. The\naverage  selling  price was $2.38 per yard for the first  quarter,  compared  to\n$2.57 per yard in the same quarter last year, a decrease of 7.4%.\n\n     Operating  income -- For the first  quarter of fiscal  2005,  the  mattress\nfabrics segment reported  operating  income of $2.9 million,  or 11.2% of sales,\ncompared  with $4.1  million,  or 15.2% of sales,  for the  prior  year  period.\nOperating  income was  primarily  impacted by fewer  sales  weeks and  inventory\nmarkdowns  related to certain customer  programs.  These factors are expected to\nhave significantly less impact on the segment's second quarter results.\n\n\n\n     UPHOLSTERY FABRICS SEGMENT (See page 5 - Sales, Gross Profit and Operating\n     Income (Loss) by Segment)\n\n     Net Sales --  Upholstery  fabric sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2005\ndecreased  9.8% to $41.9  million when  compared to the first  quarter of fiscal\n2004.  Average  weekly  sales for the  first  quarter  of fiscal  2005 were $3.2\nmillion compared with $3.3 million in the prior year period, a decrease of 2.9%.\nThe lower sales primarily reflect soft demand by furniture retailers, as well as\ncurrent consumer preference for leather furniture and increased competition from\nimported fabrics, including cut and sewn kits, primarily from Asia.\n\nWith the company's offshore sourcing efforts,  including the China platform, the\ncompany is  experiencing  higher sales of upholstery  fabric  products  produced\noutside of the company's U.S.  manufacturing  plants. These sales, which include\nmicrodenier suedes and fabrics produced at the company's China plant,  increased\n162% over the prior year period and accounted for approximately $5.5 million, or\n13.1% of upholstery  fabric sales for the quarter.  Offshore  sourced fabrics of\n$2.1 million accounted for approximately 4.5% of upholstery fabric sales for the\nsame period last year.\n\nUpholstery  fabric yards sold during the first  quarter were 9.3 million  versus\n10.6 million in the first  quarter of fiscal  2004, a decline of 12.3%.  Average\nselling price was $4.25 per yard for the first  quarter  compared with $4.13 per\nyard in the same  quarter  of last  year,  an  increase  of 2.9%,  due to higher\naverage selling prices in both the CDF and CVP divisions.\n\n     Operating  income (loss) -- Operating  loss for the first quarter of fiscal\n2005 was $2.6 million,  or 6.1% of sales,  compared with a loss of $1.7 million,\nor 3.7% of sales, for the same period last year. The segment loss in each period\nwas  primarily  due to  underutilization  of the  company's  U.S.  manufacturing\ncapacity.  If sales  continue  to be under  pressure in the  upholstery  fabrics\nsegment,  management is prepared to take the necessary actions to further adjust\nthe company's cost structure and U.S. capacity,  as the company has demonstrated\nin recent years.\n\n     SG&A  EXPENSES -- SG&A  expenses of $9.3  million for the first  quarter of\nfiscal 2005 decreased  approximately $1.2 million, or 11.8%, from the prior year\namount. As a percent of net sales,  SG&A expenses  decreased to 13.7% from 14.3%\nthe previous year, due mostly to lower professional fees.\n\n     Unallocated Corporate Expenses - The unallocated corporate expense category\nincludes  certain items that have not been  allocated to the company's  segments\n(see Page 5 - Sales and Gross  Profit/Operating  Income (Loss) by Segment).  The\nmajor  components of unallocated  corporate  expenses  include  compensation and\nbenefits for certain executive  officers and all costs related to being a public\ncompany.  For the first quarter of fiscal 2005,  unallocated  corporate expenses\ntotaled  $810,000  compared  with $1.5  million  for the same  period last year,\nreflecting a substantial decrease in professional fees.\n\n     INTEREST  EXPENSE AND  INTEREST  INCOME --  Interest  expense for the first\nquarter  declined to $940,000  from $1.5 million the previous  year due to lower\nborrowings  outstanding.  Interest income decreased to $27,000 from $122,000 the\nprevious year due to lower invested balances in fiscal 2005.\n\n     INCOME TAXES -- The  effective  tax rate (taxes as a  percentage  of pretax\nincome  (loss))  for the first  quarter of fiscal 2005 was 34.0%  compared  with\n37.0% for the same period last year.\n\n\nBALANCE SHEET COMMENTS\n- ----------------------\n\n     CASH AND CASH  EQUIVALENTS - Cash and cash equivalents as of August 1, 2004\ndecreased  to $11.9  million  from  $14.6  million  at the end of  fiscal  2004,\nprimarily  reflecting  cash flow from  operations  of $2.4  million  and capital\nexpenditures  and  payments  on vendor  financed  capital  expenditures  of $5.0\nmillion.\n\n     WORKING CAPITAL -- Accounts  receivable as of August 1, 2004 increased 0.1%\nfrom the year-earlier level. Days sales outstanding totaled 30 days at August 1,\n2004  compared  with 32 days a year ago.  Inventories  at the close of the first\nquarter  increased 5.7% from a year ago.  Inventory  turns for the first quarter\nwere 4.7 versus  5.0 for the  year-earlier  period.  Operating  working  capital\n(comprised of accounts receivable and inventories,  less trade accounts payable)\nwas $61.5 million at August 1, 2004, up from $54.9 million a year ago.\n\n     PROPERTY,  PLANT AND EQUIPMENT -- Capital spending for the first quarter of\nfiscal  2005 was $4.5  million,  including  approximately  $3.9  million for the\npurchase of a building that will serve as the  company's  new corporate  offices\nand as new space for the  company's  showrooms.  The company  expects the annual\noperating costs of the new building to be significantly lower than the lease and\nrelated costs associated with the current facilities. Depreciation for the first\nquarter was $3.4 million,  and is estimated at $13.5 million for the full fiscal\nyear.  For fiscal  2005,  the company  anticipates  capital  expenditures  to be\napproximately $9.0 million, including the $5.7 million budgeted for the building\npurchase and related renovations.\n\n     INTANGIBLE  ASSETS -- As of August 1, 2004, $9.2 million in goodwill is the\ncompany's  only  intangible  asset.  This  goodwill is comprised of $4.1 million\nrelated to the mattress  fabrics  segment,  and $5.1 million related to the Culp\nDecorative Fabrics division within the upholstery fabrics segment.\n\n     LONG-TERM  DEBT  -- The  company's  long-term  debt  of  $51.1  million  is\nunsecured and is comprised of $50.0 million in outstanding  senior notes, with a\nfixed interest rate of 7.76%, and a $1.1 million, non-interest bearing term loan\nwith the  Canadian  government.  Additionally,  the company has a $15.0  million\nrevolving  credit line with a bank, of which no balance is outstanding at August\n1, 2004.  The current bank  agreement,  which  expires in August 2004,  has been\nextended to August  2005.  The first  scheduled  principal  payment on the $50.0\nmillion  senior  notes is due  March  2006 in the  amount of $7.5  million.  The\nCanadian  government  loan is  repaid in annual  installments  of  approximately\n$500,000 per year. The company was in compliance with all financial covenants in\nits loan agreements as of August 1, 2004.\n\nCASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS COMMENTS\n- ----------------------------------\n\n     Cash flow from  operations was $2.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal\n2005,  compared  with $7.9 million for the same period last year.  This decrease\nwas primarily due to higher  inventory  balances and lower cash  generated  from\naccounts  receivable  balances.  For the first quarter of fiscal 2005, cash flow\ngenerated  from  operations,  as well as a portion of existing cash on hand, was\nused for capital  expenditures,  most of which relate to the  building  purchase\ndescribed above.\n\nBUSINESS OUTLOOK\n- ----------------\n\nMattress  ticking  sales have  picked up during the early part of the  company's\nsecond  quarter.  For the  current  quarter,  management  expects  sales in this\nsegment to be  moderately  ahead of second  quarter  sales last year and expects\nthat operating income will  approximate  last year's level.  With respect to the\nupholstery  fabrics  segments,  the outlook  remains  uncertain  for a sustained\nrecovery in retail furniture business conditions.  Management is optimistic that\nupholstery  fabric sales will also pickup in the fall, as is seasonally  typical\nin the furniture  industry.  For the second quarter,  upholstery fabrics segment\nsales are  expected to  decrease  less than the first  quarter  decline of 9.8%.\nWhile  management  expects to be profitable in the upholstery  fabrics  segment,\noperating income will be down considerably  from last year's second quarter.  At\nthis  time,  the  company  expects to report net income in the range of $0.13 to\n$0.17 per share  diluted,  with the actual  results  depending  primarily on the\nlevel of demand throughout the quarter.  Management believes that the excellence\nin design  creativity,  the strength in the company's mattress ticking business,\nthe company's  aggressive  expansion of its' offshore sourcing  capabilities and\nthe  company's  sound  balance  sheet  effectively   position  Culp  in  today's\nmarketplace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", u'\n', u'\n', u'\n-----END PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE-----\n']
