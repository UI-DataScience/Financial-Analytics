CENTRAL DAYLIGHT TIME TODAY\n                                   WWW.TI.COM\n                                   ----------\n\n\nDALLAS (Sept. 8, 2004) - In a scheduled update to its business outlook for the\nthird quarter of 2004, Texas Instruments Incorporated (NYSE:TXN) today revised\nits expected revenue and earnings ranges. This update reflects what TI believes\nare adjustments by customers as they move quickly to reduce inventory levels to\nmore closely match their own end-equipment growth rates. These adjustments are\nmore aggressive in standard products sold through the distribution channel than\nin other areas.\n\nThe company\'s expectations for revenue are:\n\n- -    Total revenue between $3100 million and $3240 million, compared with the\n     prior range of $3200 million to $3440 million;\n\n- -    Semiconductor revenue between $2665 million and $2785 million, compared\n     with the prior range of $2780 million to $2980 million;\n\n- -    Sensors & Controls revenue between $260 million and $270 million, compared\n     with the prior range of $255 million to $275 million; and\n\n- -    Educational & Productivity Solutions revenue between $175 million and $185\n     million, compared with the prior range of $170 million to $190 million.\n\nTI expects earnings per share (EPS) between $0.27 and $0.29, compared with the\nprevious range of $0.26 to $0.29.\n\nThe company\'s revised earnings estimate reflects reduced factory loadings and a\nlower expected accrual for profit sharing. Additionally, the effective annual\ntax rate has been reduced from 29 percent to 26 percent, primarily due to an\nincrease in the estimated tax benefit for export sales. Including catch-up\nadjustments, the third-quarter effective tax rate is estimated to be about 21\npercent.\n\nThe company will hold a conference call at 3:30 p.m. CDT today to discuss this\nupdate. This conference call will be available live at www.ti.com. TI\'s original\nthird-quarter outlook was published in the company\'s second-quarter 2004\nearnings release on July 20, available at www.ti.com. TI\'s third quarter ends on\nSeptember 30.\n\n                                    #   #   #\n\n"Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of\n1995: This release includes forward-looking statements intended to qualify for\nthe safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation\nReform Act of 1995.
