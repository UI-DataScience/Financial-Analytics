(Nasdaq: IMMU) today\nreported revenues of $0.9 million and a net loss of $6.8 million, or $0.14 per\nshare, for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004, which ended June 30, 2004.\nThis compares to revenues of $1.7 million and a net loss of $3.7 million, or\n$0.07 per share, for the same period last year. Revenues declined primarily due\nto the completion of the sale of research and development materials in the first\nquarter of fiscal year 2004, which were part of the Amgen Agreement. These sales\ncontributed approximately $.7 million of revenues in the fourth quarter of\nfiscal year 2003. Expenses were higher this quarter due to increased research\nand development activities and a one-time cost associated with warrants issued\nto Amgen Inc. for the return of all rights and clinical results for epratuzumab\nin April 2004.\n\nFor the fiscal year 2004, the Company reported revenues of $4.3 million and a\nnet loss of $22.4 million, or $0.45 per share. This compares to revenues of\n$13.7 million and a net loss of $7.9 million, or $0.16 per share, for fiscal\nyear 2003. The decline in revenues resulted primarily from the Company\nrecognizing its final portion of the $18.0 million up-front licensing payment\nfrom Amgen Inc. in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003. At June 30, 2004, the\nCompany had $18.6 million in cash and liquid securities, including $5.1 million\nof restricted securities that collateralize the New Jersey Economic Development\nAuthority financing completed in May 2003 for the construction of the Company\'s\nexpanded manufacturing facilities. In August 2004, the Company raised an\nadditional approximately $14 million from the sale of its common stock to a\ngroup of accredited investors.\n\n"The higher expenses incurred in the fourth quarter were the result of a\none-time, non-cash charge for warrants issued to Amgen, and increased research\nand development activities. In particular, with the return of epratuzumab from\nAmgen, we have increased our manufacturing spending in anticipation of new\nclinical trials in lymphoma and autoimmune diseases for our most advanced\npotential product. To bolster our cash reserves, we added approximately $14\nmillion in early August 2004 from the net proceeds of a sale of our common\nstock. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to raise additional capital\nthrough licensing of our products and technologies, the sale of debt and/or\nequity securities, or some combination of the foregoing as they arise,"\ncommented Gerard G. Gorman, the Company\'s Vice President, Finance, and Chief\nFinancial Officer.\n\nThe Company reported the initial clinical results from a European study with\nepratuzumab administered to patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) at\nthe 7th International Congress on SLE in May 2004 (see\nhttp://www.immunomedics.com/7events/Kaufman_SLE_LL2_final.pdf). This pilot study\nestablished the safety, tolerability, lack of immunogenicity and early evidence\nof efficacy in SLE patients. "We are very encouraged with these results, which\nnow need to be confirmed in larger randomized trials," remarked Cynthia L.\nSullivan, the Company\'s President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nOther developments of note during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 were as\nfollows:\n\no  The Company presented six abstracts at the 40th meeting of the American\n   Society of Clinical Oncology communicating clinical and preclinical advances\n   in the therapy of non-Hodgkin\'s lymphoma, multiple myeloma and colorectal\n   cancer.\n\no  The Company and its subsidiary, IBC Pharmaceuticals, Inc., reported nine\n   studies at the 51st Annual Meeting of the Society of Nuclear Medicine on\n   clinical and preclinical progress on therapeutics for non-Hodgkin\'s lymphoma,\n   colorectal and pancreatic cancers using radiolabeled antibodies.\n\n"We remain focused on bringing our potential therapeutic products to the market\nexpeditiously. The approximately $14 million we raised in August allows us to\nmaintain our momentum in the development of epratuzumab for the treatment of\nnon-Hodgkin\'s lymphoma and systemic lupus erythematosus, while we continue\ndiscussions on worldwide licensing of this product. We have also begun our Phase\nI and II clinical studies in certain other indications for other humanized\nantibodies, such as those targeting the CD20 antigen expressed by B-cells in\nvarious diseases, another antigen expressed in pancreatic cancers, and the\nalpha-fetoprotein marker on primary liver cancers," Ms. Sullivan added.\n\nImmunomedics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development,\nmanufacture and commercialization of diagnostic imaging and therapeutic products\nfor the detection and treatment of cancer and other serious diseases. Integral\nto these products are highly specific monoclonal antibodies and antibody\nfragments designed to deliver radioisotopes and chemotherapeutic agents to\ntumors and other sites of disease. Immunomedics has therapeutic product\ncandidates in clinical development and has two marketed diagnostic imaging\nproducts. Our most advanced therapeutic product candidate is epratuzumab, for\nwhich certain Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of non-Hodgkin\'s\nlymphoma have already been completed.\n\nThis release, in addition to historical information, contains forward-looking\nstatements made pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of\n1995.
