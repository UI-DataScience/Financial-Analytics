(NYSE: SFP) announced today its fiscal 2004\nresults for the fourth quarter and full year ended July 3, 2004. The Company\nreported net sales of $249.7 million for the fourth quarter, versus $189.2\nmillion for the fiscal 2003 fourth quarter. Salton reported a loss of $50.2\nmillion, or $(4.42) per share, versus a loss of $8.8 million or $(0.79) per\nshare for the same period of 2003. Net sales increased due to the inclusion of\nan additional $42.5 million in sales from Amalgamated Appliances Holdings\nLimited ("AMAP") as a result of growth and the inclusion of a full fourth\nquarter of sales. The Company had $9.4 million in favorable currency effects and\n$5.8 million of growth in other international operations. Domestic sales grew by\n$2.8 million, the first increase in the U.S. since the 2002 fiscal year. The\nGeorge Foreman product line posted a global increase in sales of 7.1% for the\nfourth quarter.\n\nThe loss in the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter included a $23.6 million pre-tax\ncharge associated with the U.S. restructuring plans. The restructuring charge\nconsists of $20.2 million related to the write-down of certain inventory\nidentified for liquidation as part of the Company\'s decision to rationalize\nwarehouse and distribution facilities; $1.7 million for the discontinuation of\nseveral marketing programs; $1.2 million of consulting and legal costs directly\nassociated with the development and implementation of the restructuring plans\nand $0.5 million in severance.\n\nThe fourth quarter also reflects pre-tax charges taken related to the\nrestructuring efforts and subsequent valuation reviews in light of those\ndecisions, which include a $6.5 million intangible asset impairment charge and a\n$3.8 million fixed asset charge primarily related to tooling.\n\nOther items impacting the 2004 fourth quarter results include a $6.9 million\ncharge for the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain foreign\nincome tax credits and a $5.0 million pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment\nof debt.\n\nExcluding these restructuring charges and other items, the Company would have\nreported a fourth quarter net loss of $19.2 million, versus a net loss of $8.8\nmillion in the fiscal 2003 fourth quarter. A reconciliation of the amounts is\nincluded in the supplemental schedule contained in this press release. These\nnon-GAAP measurements are provided to help investors understand the Company\'s\nfinancial results given the significant impact of the U.S. operation\'s\nrestructuring activities. Future restructuring charges related to the closure of\nfacilities and other items are expected to be less than $2.0 million.\n\nFor the full-year, the Company reported net sales of $1.1 billion versus $894.9\nmillion in the fiscal 2003 period. Net sales increased due to the inclusion of\nan additional $206.4 million in sales for a full year of AMAP. The Company had\n$29.2 million in favorable currency effects and $12.6 million of growth in other\ninternational operations. These increases were offset by a $66.5 million decline\nin the domestic market primarily due to a decrease in George Foreman product\nsales in the first part of the year. For the full-year, Salton reported a net\nloss of $95.2 million, or $(8.45) per share, versus net income of $8.0 million,\nor $0.53 per diluted share in the fiscal 2003 period. Excluding the\naforementioned charges for the fourth quarter and a non-cash intangible asset\nwrite-off of $34.3 million in the third quarter, Salton would have reported a\nloss of $38.2 million for the 2004 fiscal year, versus net income of $8.5\nmillion for the 2003 fiscal year. A\n\n\n', u'\n\n\nreconciliation of the amounts is included in a supplemental schedule that is\ncontained in this press release.\n\nOn May 11, 2004, Salton announced a decision to restructure its U.S. operations\nunder a plan to reduce annual domestic operating expenses by a minimum of $40.0\nmillion through a 25% reduction in U.S. personnel, the closure of several\nfacilities, a reduction in advertising, infomercial and cooperative advertising\nexpenses, and other consolidation and cost reduction initiatives. During the\nmonth of July, the Company\'s SG&A and distribution cost reductions exceeded\nbudgeted expectations. The Company expects that the reduction in annual domestic\noperating expenses resulting from its U.S. restructuring plan will exceed $40.0\nmillion.\n\n"Since we announced plans to restructure our U.S. operations, we have\naggressively pursued initiatives to realign our domestic cost structure with our\ncurrent level of domestic revenue," said Leonhard Dreimann, Salton\'s Chief\nExecutive Officer. "These actions have lowered our operating costs in the U.S.,\nallowing us to significantly improve our operating results going forward. Our\nfourth quarter sales results, which included our first quarter of revenue growth\nin the U.S. in two years, suggest domestic sales are stabilizing. Recently, we\nentered into an amended revolving credit agreement, which has increased our\nfinancial flexibility and will allow us to meet our working capital needs during\nthe holiday season. Our international operations continue to generate strong\ngrowth, as results from South Africa, Europe and Australia continue to underpin\nour business."\n\nBusiness Outlook:\n\n"Although we have been highly focused on reducing costs domestically, Salton is\nrecognized as an innovator in product development, and introduced over 40 new\nproducts at the Housewares Show last Spring," continued Mr. Dreimann. "We have\nalready seen strong interest from retailers for the George Foreman The Next\nGrilleration(TM), which has removable grilling plates, making cleaning easier.\nWe are confident that the added convenience provided by this new grill will\ntrigger a replacement cycle among our existing customers. In addition to the\nForeman line of grills, we introduced many new products at the Housewares Show\nwhich were well received."\n\nThe Company\'s executives will hold a conference call today that will take place\nat 9:00 a.m. ET.

Details of the items are presented in the tables within this\ndocument.

Also, reconciliations from GAAP reported\nresults to non-GAAP measurements that may be discussed on this morning's\nearnings conference call can be found on Salton's Web site at\nwww.saltoninc.com.\n\nSalton, Inc. has provided these non-GAAP measurements as a way to help investors\nbetter understand earnings and enhance comparisons of our earnings from period\nto period. Among other things, our management uses the earnings results,\nexcluding items affecting comparability, to evaluate the performance of its\nbusinesses. There are inherent limitations in the use of earnings, excluding\nitems affecting comparability, because actual results do include the impact of\nthese items. The non-GAAP measures are intended only as a supplement to the\ncomparable GAAP measures and we compensate for the limitations inherent in the\nuse of non-GAAP measures by using GAAP measures in conjunction with the non-GAAP\nmeasures. As a result, investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in\naddition to, and not in substitution for, or as superior to, measures of\nfinancial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nAbout Salton, Inc.\n\nSalton, Inc. is a leading designer, marketer and distributor of branded, high\nquality small appliances, home decor and personal care products. Our product mix\nincludes a broad range of small kitchen and home appliances, electronics,\ntabletop products, time products, lighting products, picture frames and personal\ncare and wellness products.

proceedings; cancellation or reduction of orders; the timely development,\nintroduction and customer acceptance of Salton's products; dependence on foreign\nsuppliers and supply and manufacturing constraints; competitive products and\npricing; economic conditions and the retail environment; the availability and\nsuccess of future acquisitions; international business activities; the
