("NCC"). Under\nthe terms of the agreement, the Registrant will receive an initial payment of up\nto $100,000, and will receive 50% of the revenue related to the transferred\ncorrespondent accounts over the next five years, up to a maximum total payment\nof $2.5 million. It is expected that the transaction will close in the third\nquarter of 2004.\n\n      Once the sale of the correspondent accounts of NCC and the pending sale of\nthe on-line brokerage accounts of the Registrant\'s other wholly-owned subsidiary\nJB Oxford & Company ("JBOC") are consummated, the Registrant\'s primary source of\nincome will be earnings on the proceeds from those two transactions. The\nRegistrant has not yet made any determination about future business plans once\nthe transactions are completed, and management anticipates that it will take at\nleast one year from the closings to wind up the brokerage operations of the two\nsubsidiaries and the liabilities associated with each of them. During the next\n12 to 18 months, the Registrant will evaluate available business opportunities,\nand has no current plan to liquidate the Company. Management anticipates that\nthe proceeds from these transactions, together with earnings on such proceeds,\nwill provide the Registrant with sufficient liquidity to maintain its offices\nand a minimal staff until such time as a new business venture is decided upon.\n\nITEM 2.03       CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION.\n\n         On August 20, 2004, NCC settled two pending arbitrations involving\nclaims of approximately 60 former customers of correspondent firms that\npreviously cleared through NCC. The settlement contemplates a lump sum payment\nby the Registrant of $1.25 million on or before October 18, 2004. While the\nCompany has not specifically recorded an accrual for this settlement, it does\nmaintain a general litigation reserve of which a portion may be used to offset\nthe charge for this settlement. The Company will evaluate the adequacy of its\ngeneral litigation reserve at the end of the third quarter. As a result of this\nsettlement, the Company expects to record a charge of $750,000.\n\nITEM 2.02       RESULTS OF OPERATION AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\n\n      On August 16, 2004, the Registrant issued the press release attached\nhereto as Exhibit 99.1 announcing financial results for the second quarter of\n2004.\n\n\n\nSIGNATURE\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,\nthe Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the\nundersigned thereunto duly authorized.\n\nJB OXFORD HOLDINGS, INC.\n\nBy: /s/ Michael J.

(Nasdaq:  JBOH), which\nthrough  its JB Oxford & Company  subsidiary  is a leading  provider of discount\nbrokerage services to clients nationwide,  and National Clearing Corp subsidiary\nprovider of  correspondent  clearing  services,  reports  results for the second\nquarter ended June 30, 2004.\n\n      On June 4, 2004,  the  Company  signed an asset  purchase  agreement  with\nAmeritrade,  Inc., a subsidiary of Ameritrade Holding  Corporation,  to sell the\nonline  retail  accounts of JB Oxford & Company  ("JBOC"),  a  subsidiary  of JB\nOxford  Holdings,  Inc.  for up to $26  million  in  cash,  subject  to  certain\nadjustments and an escrow. In addition,  the Company is actively seeking a buyer\nfor its correspondent clearing operation. The sale of both these asset groups is\nexpected to take place prior to the end of the year.  These asset groups are the\nbrokerage  operations  (both  clearing  and retail  brokerage  segments)  of the\nCompany and provide  substantially  all of its operating  revenues.  These asset\ngroups  have also met the  criteria  defined by SFAS No. 144 to be  reported  as\ndiscontinued operations.\n\n      The brokerage assets and related  liabilities  have been  reclassified and\nreported as assets and  liabilities  held for sale.  No  impairment of value has\nbeen recognized,  as management  currently believes the carrying value, less any\ncosts to sell,  of these assets will be fully  recoverable  from the proceeds of\nthe sale.  Additionally,  the Company has no plan of  liquidation  nor is it the\ncurrent intention of management to liquidate the Company.  The Company will have\ncash to address its various  legal and ongoing  business  matters  following the\nsale.\n\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\n\n      Brokerage  Revenues  totaled  $8.1  million  in this  year\'s  first  half,\ncompared  with $9.9 million a year ago.  Commission  revenue was $4.0 million in\nthe first half  versus  $4.1  million in the  year-ago  first  half.  First half\ninterest  revenue was $2.6 million,  compared with $2.8 million in 2003,  due to\nlower customer margin  balances.  Trading revenue was $211,000 in the first half\n2004 versus $1.3 million a year ago.  Revenue from  clearing and  execution  was\n$1.2 million in the first half 2004 versus $1.4 in the year-ago period.\n\n      Brokerage expenses were $10.7 million in the first half 2004, versus $12.4\nmillion a year ago. First half losses from  discontinued  operations  (excluding\ntaxes)  totaled  $2.6 million or ($1.42) per share in 2004 versus a loss of $2.0\nmillion  or ($1.30)  per share in 2003.  The first  half net loss  totaled  $4.0\nmillion  or  ($2.18)  per  share in 2004  versus a net loss of $2.5  million  or\n($1.64) per share in 2003.  Common stock  equivalents  have been  excluded  from\nfully diluted  earnings per share  computations,  as inclusion would reduce loss\nper share or be antidilutive.\n\n', u"\n\nABOUT JB OXFORD HOLDINGS, INC.\n\n      JB Oxford  Holdings,  Inc.  through its JB Oxford & Company  and  National\nClearing Corp subsidiaries  provides discount and online brokerage  services all\nin  one  friendly  place,  as  well  as  clearing  and  execution  services  for\ncorrespondent  brokerage firms.
