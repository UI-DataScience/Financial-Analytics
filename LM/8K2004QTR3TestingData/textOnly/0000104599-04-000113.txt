Circuit City expects to\ninclude  international  segment  sales in  consolidated  comparable  store sales\nbeginning with the second quarter of next fiscal year.\n\n\nFor the second quarter ended August 31, 2004,  total sales increased 8.9 percent\nto  $2.35  billion  from  $2.16  billion  in the same  period  last  year,  with\ncomparable store merchandise  sales increasing 2.9 percent.  For the six months,\ntotal sales  increased  7.9 percent to $4.41  billion from $4.09  billion in the\nfirst  half of  last  fiscal  year,  with  comparable  store  merchandise  sales\nincreasing 4.5 percent.\n\n"We believe  that the second  quarter  sales  results  reflect  improvements  in\nstore-level  execution and  congratulate our store operations team for its focus\non improving the shopping  experience for Circuit City  customers," said W. Alan\nMcCollough,  Circuit City\'s chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We\nalso continue to generate strong growth in Web-originated sales. We believe that\nsofter  sales in  August,  compared  with the first two  months of the  quarter,\nreflect a generally  softer retail  climate in that month and the shift of Labor\nDay weekend into September, or our third quarter, from August of last year." The\ncompany  estimates  that the Labor Day  weekend  shift  reduced  second  quarter\ncomparable store sales by slightly more than one percentage point.\n\nSales by Merchandise  Category.  The percent of merchandise sales represented by\neach major product category for the quarters and six-month  periods ended August\n31, 2004 and 2003,  are shown below.  InterTAN sales have been included in sales\nby merchandise  category since  completion of the acquisition in May, but had no\nmaterial impact on the percentages for the second quarter or six months.\n\n', u'\n', u'\n\n                                                     Three Months Ended             Six Months Ended\n                                                          August 31                     August 31\n                                                    2004            2003          2004          2003\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------       --------------------\nVideo........................................       40%             39%           41%            39%\nAudio........................................       13              14            13             14\nInformation technology.......................       37              36            35             35\nEntertainment................................       10              11            11             12\n                                                  -----------------------       ---------------------\nTotal........................................      100%            100%          100%           100%\n                                                  =======================       ====================\n', u'\n\nIn the video  category,  Circuit City produced a single-digit  comparable  store\nsales increase,  led by sales of new technology  televisions and digital imaging\nproducts.  Video sales  reflect  triple-digit  comparable  store sales growth in\nplasma  and  LCD  televisions  and  double-digit  growth  in  sales  of  digital\ntelevisions  and  digital  imaging  products.   Double-digit  declines  in  tube\ntelevision  and DVD player sales and a single-digit  decline in camcorder  sales\npartly offset the growth in other products.\n\nComparable  store  sales  in  the  audio  category  were  relatively  unchanged.\nDouble-digit comparable store sales growth in portable audio products, driven by\ndigital audio products such as MP3 players,  and  single-digit  growth in mobile\naudio  products,   driven  by  satellite  radio,  were  offset  by  double-digit\ncomparable store sales declines in home audio products.\n\nA single-digit  comparable  store sales increase in the  information  technology\ncategory  reflects  single-digit  comparable store sales growth in both personal\ncomputer hardware and accessories.  In personal computer hardware,  double-digit\ncomparable  store sales growth in notebooks  was partly  offset by  double-digit\ndeclines in desktop  computers and  single-digit  declines in printers.  Monitor\nsales were relatively unchanged from the prior year.\n\nComparable store sales in the entertainment  category were relatively  unchanged\nreflecting a double-digit  decline in video game products offset by single-digit\ncomparable store sales growth in music software. Comparable store sales of video\nsoftware were relatively unchanged.\n\nDomestic Segment\nFor the second  quarter,  total sales for the  domestic  segment  increased  3.4\npercent to $2.23 billion from $2.16  billion in the same period last year,  with\ncomparable store  merchandise  sales  increasing 2.9 percent.  For the first six\nmonths,  total sales for the  domestic  segment  increased  4.5 percent to $4.27\nbillion from $4.09 billion in the same period last year, with  comparable  store\nmerchandise sales increasing 4.5 percent.\n\nCredit Revenues.  The domestic segment generates credit revenues from an ongoing\narrangement under which Chase Card Services offers  private-label and co-branded\ncredit cards to Circuit City customers.  The domestic  segment\'s credit revenues\nfrom that arrangement amounted to $6.6 million in this year\'s second quarter and\nare included in total sales. Prior to this year\'s second quarter,  private-label\nand co-branded  credit cards were made available  through  Circuit City\'s wholly\nowned  subsidiary,   First  North  American  National  Bank.  Private-label  and\nco-branded  finance  income was reported as finance  income on the  consolidated\nstatements of operations  in all prior  periods and,  thus,  was not included in\ntotal sales.\n\n"We are pleased  with the early  results  from our  arrangement  with Chase Card\nServices," said McCollough.  "The second quarter credit revenues were consistent\nwith our expectations for annual revenues under this relationship."\n\nStore  Revitalization.  During the quarter,  the domestic segment  continued its\nstore  revitalization  program as it opened its sixth Circuit City Superstore in\nthe Richmond,  Va.,  market and its twelfth  Superstore  in the Houston,  Texas,\nmarket and relocated a total of nine  Superstores.  The company  expects to open\nanother 18 Superstores,  relocate an additional 12 Superstores and fully remodel\none Superstore in the third quarter.\n\nInternational Segment\nCircuit City\'s total sales for the second quarter include  international segment\nsales of $118.0  million;  total sales for the six months include  international\nsegment  sales of $139.7  million.  The  international  segment  consists of the\noperations  of  InterTAN,  Inc.,  which  Circuit  City  acquired  in  May  2004.\nInternational  segment  sales will not be included in the  company\'s  comparable\nstore sales until the second  quarter of next fiscal year. For the quarter ended\nAugust 31, 2004,  InterTAN sales increased 17.1 percent,  from $100.7 million in\nthe same  period  last year and  InterTAN  comparable  store  merchandise  sales\nincreased 10.0 percent. For the six months ended August 31, 2004, InterTAN sales\nincreased  15.7  percent  from  $189.2  million in the same period last year and\nInterTAN comparable store merchandise sales increased 7.0 percent. The effect of\nfluctuations  in foreign  currency  exchange rates  accounted for  approximately\nthree  percentage  points of InterTAN\'s  second quarter total sales increase and\napproximately five percentage points of the six-month increase. Comparable store\nsales  declined 4.7 percent for the quarter ended August 31, 2003,  and declined\n6.0 percent for the six months ended August 31, 2003.\n\nStock Buyback\nDuring the second quarter,  Circuit City  repurchased  stock in the open market,\nconsistent with the board\'s $400 million authorization. Through August 31, 2004,\nthe company had repurchased and retired  approximately 20.3 million shares under\nthis authorization at a cost of $225.0 million.  Of this total,  repurchases and\nretirements  during the second quarter totaled  approximately 5.3 million shares\nat a cost of $69.6 million.\n\nEarnings Release and Conference Call Information\nCircuit City plans to release second quarter  results before the market opens on\nSeptember  17.
