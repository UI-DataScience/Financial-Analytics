This manufacturing inefficiency is associated with time requirements for the implementation of its new Enterprise Resource Planning (\x93ERP\x94) system and the conversion to lean manufacturing.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x93While it is not The Rowe Company\x92s policy to give\nspecific guidance, I am making an exception in the interest of good financial communication\x94, said Gerald Birnbach, Chairman and President. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Net shipments are expected to be approximately $76.5 million, or an increase of approximately 9% over the same quarter last year. The Company, however,\nexpects to report net earnings for the quarter below analyst estimates. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x93We continue to be pleased with Storehouse retail demand and Rowe Furniture manufacturing orders\x94, Mr. Birnbach continued. \x93Operations management in the Rowe Furniture division has been intensely focused on the implementation\nof our new ERP system and conversion to lean manufacturing, significantly reducing the time available for day-to-day management activities. During this period manufacturing productivity has declined below our expected levels. While it is anticipated\nthat the line management time requirement for conversion to the new system should diminish in the near future at which time our line managers will return to their normal responsibilities, we will not make the conversion until we are satisfied that\nthe system will operate as planned\x94. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x93Our new ERP\nsystem will give us substantial new capabilities in critical areas such as merchandising, and gives us the scale for growth. While we are disappointed that our earnings aren\x92t higher, we know that this kind of a disruption is temporary and not\nuncommon when undertaking complex technology initiatives\x94 Mr. Birnbach continued. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'The Rowe Companies anticipates releasing earnings for the third quarter on September 22nd followed by a\nconference call. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The Rowe Companies operates two subsidiaries\nin the home furnishings industry: Rowe Furniture, Inc., a major manufacturer of quality upholstered furniture serving the middle and upper middle market throughout the U.S.; and Storehouse, Inc., a multi-channel, lifestyle home furnishings business\nincluding 60 retail home furnishings stores. Storehouse makes good design accessible by selling an edited assortment of casual, contemporary home furnishings through its stores located in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic markets, its\ncatalog and over the internet.
