Net income for fiscal year 2004\nwas  $1,191,000  or  $0.16  per  share  compared  to  a  loss  of\n$1,008,000, $0.14 per share or approximately a $2.2 million or  a\n$.40  per  share  improvement over last year.   Operating  income\nincreased in fiscal year 2004 by $1,015,000 over the prior fiscal\nyear  on gross revenue of $60,454,000, a 6% increase compared  to\ngross  revenue for the prior fiscal year.  The improved financial\nresults are the result of last year\'s restructuring program along\nwith rebuilding the Company for future growth.\n\nVersar finished the year with a funded backlog of $46 million,  a\n44%  increase  over that reported at the end of the prior  fiscal\nyear.   In addition, total contract backlog (backlog the  Company\nexpects  to  book  with  existing unfunded multi-year  contracts)\nincreased to an all time high of $370 million.  This was  due  to\nthe  award of several new large, multi-year contracts as well  as\nwinning  all  of  its contracts that were up  for  re-compete  in\nfiscal year 2004.\n\nVersar\'s  balance sheet was strengthened so that as of  June  30,\n2004,  the Company completely repaid its line of credit and  held\napproximately $817,000 in cash.  Versar now has approximately  $6\nmillion  of  working  capital for future  business  growth.   The\nCompany\'s  equity has now exceeded $10 million  and  the  balance\nsheet ratios exceed industry averages.\n\nGross  revenue  for  the fourth quarter was  $17,431,000,  a  21%\nincrease  over the same quarter of fiscal year 2003.  Net  income\nfor  the  fourth quarter was $461,000 or $0.06 per share compared\nto  $519,000  or  $0.07  per share for  the  fourth  quarter  the\nprevious  year.  The slight drop in profitability in  the  fourth\nquarter  2004  was  due to unplanned costs as  a  result  of  new\nregulatory  requirements in the Company\'s chemical and biological\nlaboratories.\n\nDr. Ted Prociv, President and CEO of Versar said "The operational\nand  financial  results  for fiscal year  2004  create  a  strong\nfoundation  for future success.  The results of our restructuring\nand  focus on the federal marketplace have led to a new, directed\norganization  which  will  allow us  to  take  advantage  of  the\ntremendous  business  opportunities  in  the  infrastructure  and\nnational  security  marketplaces.  Five  profitable  quarters,  a\ngrowing  backlog  and  strengthened balance  sheet,  now  enables\nVersar to focus on growth; both on the top and bottom line."\n\nVersar,  Inc.,  headquartered in Springfield, VA, is  a  publicly\nheld   professional  services  firm  supporting  government   and\nindustry   in   national   defense/homeland   defense   programs,\nenvironmental    health    and    safety    and    infrastructure\nrevitalization.
