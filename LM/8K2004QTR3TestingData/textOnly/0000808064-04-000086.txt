(NYSE: CHP), a leading\nNorth American  producer and marketer of electrical power storage and conversion\nproducts used in telecommunications and industrial applications, today announced\nfinancial results for its second quarter ended July 31, 2004. Net income for the\nquarter  was $3.2  million,  or 13 cents per  diluted  share,  compared  to $3.6\nmillion or 14 cents per diluted  share in the prior year\'s second  quarter.  Net\nsales for the quarter were $94.4 million, a 16.0% increase from the prior year\'s\nsecond quarter sales of $81.4 million.\n\nFor the six months ended July 31, 2004, net income was $5.2 million, or 20 cents\nper diluted share,  compared to $6.4 million,  or 25 cents per diluted share, in\nthe  prior  year\'s  comparable  period.  Net sales for the  period  were  $180.2\nmillion,  a 13.5%  increase  from the prior  year\'s  comparable  period sales of\n$158.7 million.\n\nThe  acquisitions of Datel,  Inc. and Celab,  Ltd.,  completed during the second\nquarter,  added $7.4  million of sales to the second  quarter  and  year-to-date\nresults.\n\nWade H.  Roberts,  Jr.,  president and chief  executive  officer of the company,\nsaid,  "C&D  Technologies  continued  to gain sales  momentum  during the second\nquarter,  with all three of its  operating  divisions  growing  organically.  In\naddition,  we are pleased with the initial  financial  performance  of Datel and\nCelab,  with each  acquisition  contributing  to  earnings  during the  quarter.\nHowever, the price of lead continued to negatively affect financial  performance\nin the Motive  Power and Standby  Power  divisions,  and we  estimate  that lead\npricing reduced  earnings per share by approximately 16 cents during the quarter\ncompared to last year\'s second quarter."\n\nC&D Technologies\'  second quarter operating results by reporting segment were as\nfollows:\n\nStandby Power - Sales increased 3.6% in the quarter, to $61.5 million from $59.4\nmillion in the prior year\'s second quarter. The increase was driven by increased\nsales to the UPS market.  Operating  income was $5.8  million,  compared to $8.3\nmillion in the  year-ago  quarter.  The  Standby  Power  Division  continued  to\nexperience  high  raw  material  costs  (principally  lead),  as well  as  plant\ntransition expenses during the second quarter,  the latter,  associated with the\nstart-up of production at the Reynosa,  Mexico plant  acquired last year.  These\ncombined costs negatively  impacted the current quarter\'s  operating income by a\ntotal of approximately $5.9 million.\n\nPower  Electronics - Sales  increased 89.7% during the quarter to $19.0 million,\n\n\n\n ', u'\n\n\n\nfrom $10.0  million in the prior year\'s  second  quarter.  The revenue  increase\nreflected $7.4 million from acquisitions  closed during the quarter,  as well as\nimproved  demand for DC to DC products.  Operating  income in the second quarter\nwas $2.9  million,  compared  to an  operating  loss of  $391,000  in the second\nquarter of fiscal 2004.  Excluding the  acquisition-related  revenues  mentioned\nabove,  Power Electronics  Division revenues for the quarter were $11.7 million,\nan increase of 16.2% from the second quarter of fiscal 2004.\n\nMotive Power - Sales  increased  16.1% in the second  quarter to $13.9  million,\nfrom $12.0  million in the prior  year\'s  second  quarter,  as both  battery and\ncharger sales improved. The division\'s operating loss was $2.0 million, compared\nto an operating loss of $1.6 million in the prior year\'s quarter. Motive Power\'s\noperating loss was also negatively  affected by increased raw material costs and\nthe plant  transition  expenses,  previously  referred to, which  increased  the\ndivision\'s current quarter operating loss by approximately $1.8 million.\n\nIn commenting on the outlook for the third quarter,  Mr. Roberts  stated,  "Thus\nfar in fiscal 2005,  sales growth has been solid.  We continue to be hit hard by\nraw material  pricing as well as the anticipated  plant startup costs.  However,\noverall,  financial  results improved from the previous  quarter,  and we expect\nthis trend to continue into the next  quarter,  as the  transition  costs to our\nReynosa,  Mexico  facility wind down.  Accordingly,  we are  projecting  diluted\nearnings per share in the range of 13 to17 cents for the third  quarter based on\nthe assumption that lead pricing does not worsen."\n\nC&D Technologies will hold a conference call on Friday,  August 27, 2004 at 9:00\nAM Eastern  Daylight Time to discuss these  results in detail.
