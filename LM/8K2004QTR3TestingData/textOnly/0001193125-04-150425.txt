The strong performance in live production and pork was moderated by lower earnings in the beef segment. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Earnings in the company\x92s hog production segment rose more than 70 percent, reflecting\nthe impact of a 29 percent increase in live hog prices compared with the first quarter of last year. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Commodity futures contracts for live hogs reduced hog production earnings by $47 million for the quarter. These contracts were the result of the company\x92s decision, earlier in the calendar year, to lock in\nprofits in hog production before the unexpected increase in live hog market prices experienced during the first quarter. During the same period, hog production results benefited by $28 million from favorable grain purchasing arrangements, also\nentered into earlier in the year. These arrangements resulted in raising costs of $43 per hundredweight, up four percent from the prior year, but eight percent lower than raising costs would have been, absent these advance grain purchasing\nagreements. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Joseph W. Luter, III, chairman and chief executive officer, noted\nthat these contracts were entered into at a time when hog supplies were projected to increase, which they did, and grain prices were soaring- ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'two important negative factors for Smithfield\x92s hog raising operations. \x93We saw an opportunity to lock in\nsubstantial profits in our hog operations, and we did. Clearly, this did not turn out to be the best decision, but earlier this year the situation was different. If I had to do it over again, given the same facts, I would likely make the same\ndecision,\x94 said Mr. Luter. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The company\x92s pork segment reported\nsubstantial operating profits in the current year versus a loss last year. The improved results reflected the benefit of continued strong earnings from Farmland Foods, a more favorable fresh pork environment and strong export demand. The company\nnoted that the fiscal first quarter is generally the weakest quarter of the year for pork, as demand is usually soft in the summer months. This was not the case this year, as consumer demand remained strong for all proteins, including pork.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Although processed meats margins weakened from last year\x92s levels due to\nhigher raw material costs, the company\x92s overall processed meats business continued strong. Processed meats volume grew 30 percent, including Farmland, with meaningful growth in several categories, including hams, luncheon meats, smoked sausage\nand pre-cooked entrees. The company is continuing to advance its bacon strategy and installed three new bacon lines during the quarter to meet sales and production needs as they develop. This strategy should increase the company\x92s bacon sales\nby more than 20 percent over time. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Beef results were sharply lower as export\nmarkets remained closed to U.S. beef due to the discovery of a single case of BSE in the state of Washington in December 2003. Additionally, lower cattle supplies kept live cattle prices high, pressured margins and created plant operating\ninefficiencies due to lack of cattle to process. The company\x92s beef segment includes almost $3 million of operating losses related to Showcase Foods, Inc. Smithfield previously announced that it intended to cease operations at this\nPhiladelphia-based case ready meats facility and that it expected to record additional charges of $6 to $8 million in the first half of fiscal 2005 in connection with closing the facility. The closing of the facility and the related charges are\nexpected to occur in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Led by improved\nresults in its turkey and international operations, the other segment reported a profit for the current quarter versus a loss in the same quarter last year. The company noted that it continues to be optimistic about the opportunities outside the\nU.S. The recent acquisition of Jean Caby in France and increased ownership in Campofrio in Spain, combined with existing operations in France and Poland, provide the company with a significant platform to grow in both Western and Eastern Europe.\nSmithfield said that it will continue to pursue opportunities in Europe and expects to further expand its operations there in the near future. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x93I am pleased with the first quarter,\x94 said Mr. Luter. \x93This was a strong quarter, as both pork and hog production improved at the same time; this is\nusually not the case, certainly not in the summer months. Our beef results were disappointing, but were something we simply could not control. Once the export markets and the Canadian border reopen, these results will likely return to more normal\nlevels. In the meantime, we are continuing to concentrate on running our operations very efficiently, which, we believe, are competitive with any in the industry,\x94 he said. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x93Looking forward, I am optimistic,\x94 said Mr. Luter. \x93The upcoming second quarter will include the adverse impact of\napproximately $35 million in live hog futures contracts, although hog production operations will continue to be solidly profitable. This will be offset by $12-$15 million favorable benefit of purchasing arrangements for grain, which will hold\nraising costs near $43 per hundredweight.\x94 The company noted that it has no live hog futures contracts in place beyond its current fiscal second quarter. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x93We also are entering the fall season where processing margins improve considerably. Given what I see today, in terms of live production profits, processed meats\nmargins and the continuing improvements in our international operations, and despite the unpredictability of future earnings, I believe that fiscal 2005 should be a record year for Smithfield Foods,\x94 said Mr. Luter. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'With annualized sales of $10 billion, Smithfield Foods is the leading processor and marketer of fresh pork and processed\nmeats in the United States, as well as the largest producer of hogs.
