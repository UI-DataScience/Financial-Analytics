(NYSE: TDI), today announced\nimproved financial results for the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter and full year\nended June 30, 2004.  The fiscal 2004 quarter was the sixth-consecutive\nperiod earnings improved year-over-year, and the sales level was the\nhighest in over 20 years.\n\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 increased 7.6 percent to\n$57,146,000 from $53,100,000 for the same period last year. Sales were\npositively impacted by net favorable currency exhcange rates, primarily\nthe Euro and Australian Dollar in relation to the U.S. Dollar, of\napproximately $1.7 million compared with the same quarter last year. The\nCompany's joint venture agreement governing it's subsidiary in Japan was\namended effective in the fiscal 2004 first quarter. The effect of this\nchange had no impact on net earnings during this quarter. Last year's\nfiscal fourth-quarter results, however, included $3.6 million in sales\nfor certain territories that are no longer recognized by the joint\nventure. If these were excluded, sales in the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter\nwould have been 15.4 percent highter than the same period last year.\n\nProfitability in the quarter continued to improve from the implementation\nof cost reduction programs, a restructuring program undertaken last year,\na better product mix and the absence of manufacturing inefficiencies which\nabsorbed higher steel, energy and shipping costs. The gross margin in the\nfiscal 2004 fiscal 2004 quarter improved 385 basis points over the same\nperiod  last year. For the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter, net income was\n$2,788,000, or $0.97 per diluted share, compared with last year's net income\nof $1,941,000, or $0.70 per diluted share.\n\nNet sales for the 2004 full year were up 3.6 percent to $1,86,089,000\ncompared with last year's $179,591,000. Included in the 2004 sales were net\nfavorable currency exchange rate benefits of approximately $10.0 milllion\ncompared with the same period last year. The prior year included $13.0\nmillion in sales from the Japenese distribution subsidiary that are no\nlonger recognized in accordance with the amended agreement discussed\npreviously. This change had no impact on net earnings. The sequence of\nthe manufacturing effcienciesthat began in the prior fiscal year\ncontributed strongly to the 610 basis point improvement in the gross margin\nfor fiscal 2004 compared with last year. Net income for 2004 was $5,243,000,\nor $1.84 per diluted share compared with last year's net loss of $2,368,000,\nor $0.84 per share.\n\n", u' 2\nMichael E. Batten, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We were very\npleased that the sales and earnings improvements that began in fiscal 2003\ngained momentum throughout this year. Our people were consistently challenged\nin fiscal 2004 especially during the second half, to maintain manufacturing\nquality at high production rates. Our shipments were up, on a sequential\nbasis, nearly 18.0 percent in the fourth quarter and 15.0 percent in the third\nquarter.\n\n"In the fourth quarter we acquired a wonderful company, Rolla SP Propellers.\nBased in Switzerland, Rolla is a leading international designer and\nmanufacturer of high-performance propulsion products. The acquisition will\nhave no impact on this year\'s operating results because it closed on June 30,\n2004, but will be accretive to fiscal 2005\'s financial results. Our Arneson\noperation has worked closely with Rolla over the years and having its\nhydrodynamic technology in house will further enhance its quality and service.\n\n"In addition, our balance sheet stregthened at year end because of our strong\nasset management and the financial imporvements. Shareholders\' equity\nincreased nearly 21.0 percent to $60.7 million, or $21.37 per share, while\nlong-term debt was up modestly, and the accrued retirement liability declined\nby almost 13.0 percent.\n\n"Our backlog of orders may have a greater variance over comparable periods\nbecause our selling cycle is narrowing. Orders to be shipped over the next\nsix months were $49,400,000 which was an increase of more than 60.0 percent\nfrom the start of the fiscal year, but down modestly from the prior quarter\'s\n$52,300,000. Our marketing activity and production schedules are higher\nthan normal for this time of year, seasonally a softer period, which bodes\nwell for our fiscal 2005 outlook"\n\nTwin Disc, Inc., designs, manufactures and internationally distributes\nheavy-duty off-highway power transmission equipment for the construction,\nindustrial, government, marine, agricultural, and energy and natural resources\nmarkets.\n\nThis press release may contain statements that are forward-looking as defined by\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases.\nThe Company intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe\nharbors created thereby.
