Reported net income was $5.3 million, or $0.20\nper diluted share. Net income for the prior-year quarter was $262,000, or $0.01\nper diluted share. All per share amounts have been adjusted for the recent\n3-for-2 stock split completed in August 2004.\n\nNet sales for the quarter ended August 29, 2004, increased to $59.7 million,\ncompared with $22.3 million a year earlier. Sales and earnings for the\nprior-year first quarter were affected by a planned reduction in deliveries of\nmagnet systems to accommodate a strategic enhancement to the company\'s exclusive\nsupply agreement with its major customer, an integrator of magnetic resonance\nimaging systems.\n\n"We are extremely pleased with our first-quarter performance--across the\nboard--in terms of the entire P&L, the balance sheet and the overall success of\nour newly broadened base of businesses," said Glenn H. Epstein, chairman and\nchief executive officer. "Our revenue is right on target for the conclusion of\nthe slower summer sales season even when taking into account the later than\nanticipated closing of our acquisition of MRI Devices (MRID).\n\n"Our newly acquired businesses--Invivo and MRID--have been performing well, as\nhave our historical businesses," Epstein said. "The Instrumentation segment was\nespecially strong, with a nearly 42 percent increase in sales and more than four\ntimes the operating profit of a year earlier."\n\nSMOOTH INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES\n\nEpstein said that the integration of Invivo, a maker of MRI-related patient\nmonitoring systems and other devices acquired early in 2004, has been\nessentially completed and that the integration of MRID is proceeding on plan.\nInvivo contributed $18.6 million in\n\n                                     -More-\n\n\n', u'\n\n\n\n\nrevenue, an improvement of more than 15 percent from a year earlier. MRID, a\nmaker of specialized Radio Frequency (RF) coils and sub-systems for MRI\nequipment, contributed about $5 million in revenue during its first six weeks as\npart of Intermagnetics.\n\n"We are highly confident that these integrations will continue to progress\nsmoothly and that both the key management and overall employee base will\ncontribute to the long-term growth of our company," Epstein said.\n\nEpstein noted that this is the last quarter where stand-alone revenue figures\nwill be available for MRID due to its physical merger into one operating\ndivision with the pre-existing RF coil business of Medical Advances, Inc. (MAI).\nExpectations remain that combined revenues this fiscal year will still\ndemonstrate growth over the prior year despite some product rationalization\nactivities currently underway.\n\nSTRONG RESULTS FROM ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\n"The operating units we had in place prior to the acquisitions all turned in\nstrong performances during the first quarter," Epstein said. "Magnet Systems &\nComponents sales (exclusive of MRID) were consistent with seasonal expectations,\nand the RF coil product lines continued to benefit from the efforts of the\nInvivo sales team. The direct sales potential of MRID\'s RF coils are also\nexpected to benefit from the combined global sales effort in the coming quarter.\nAll businesses within the segment contributed to producing a $7.6 million\noperating profit, compared with $297,000 in last year\'s first quarter.\n\n"Invivo\'s $18.6 million in sales resulted in a $1.5 million operating profit for\nthe new Medical Devices segment," Epstein added. "The Instrumentation segment,\nconsisting of Polycold Systems, Inc., had an exceptional quarter, with sales\nclimbing 42 percent to $8.2 million and operating profit increasing to $2.5\nmillion, from slightly less than $0.6 million last year. Polycold continues to\nsee increases in demand for vacuum-related products across a broad range of\nnon-semiconductor related customers in Europe, the U.S. and the Pacific Rim."\n\nThe Energy Technology segment achieved significant technical and prototype\ndevice milestones on revenue of $1.5 million and an overall investment of $2.1\nmillion, both of which were in line with anticipated levels of activity for this\nemerging business area.\n\nBALANCE SHEET REMAINS STRONG\n\nThe company reported a strong balance sheet with operating cash flow of nearly\n$5.9 million during the quarter, resulting in a cash position of $10.8 million\nat quarter-end net of $11.1 million of repayment of debt, $10 million of which\nwas in excess of scheduled requirements. Total long-term debt now stands at\n$94.3 million. Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation (EBITDA) reached\n$10.7 million. Epstein said the company\'s strengthening cash flow continues to\nprovide the flexibility to aggressively pay down debt while maintaining the\nability to invest in ongoing growth opportunities throughout the operating\nbusinesses.\n\n\n                                     -More-\n\n\n', u'\n\n\nPERFORMANCE AGAINST GOALS\n\nEpstein noted that Intermagnetics\' first-quarter gross margin of 45 percent\nsubstantially exceeded the company\'s recently enhanced target of 42 percent due\nto favorable product mix and continued cost reduction efforts, with particular\ncontributions from accelerating efficiencies at Polycold. He commented that\nwhile it remains premature to revise consolidated gross margin targets upward,\nthe overall financial model will be re-examined once MRID has been included in\nresults for a full quarter of operations. Operating income as a percent of sales\nwas 16 percent, which exceeded the ongoing target of 15 percent. Return on\nassets, at 49 percent, was consistent with the long-term goal of 50 percent.\nReturn on equity was very strong--19 percent--versus the recently raised goal of\n15 percent.\n\n"Our overall efficiency in utilizing working capital was not to our historical\nstandard--21 percent versus our goal of requiring less than 15 percent of\nsales--largely because of the effects of the acquired companies\' current\ninventories and accounts receivable," Epstein said. "These metrics are in the\nprocess of being prioritized, and we expect to demonstrate improvement in the\ncoming quarters."\n\nACQUISITION-RELATED, NON-CASH ITEMS DETAILED\n\nAmong the items excluded in comparisons and operating EPS projections is about\n$0.12 in non-cash performance-based stock compensation expense, expected to be\nsplit evenly over the four quarters. Another $0.03 in final charges related to\nthe Invivo acquisition are expected to consist of about $0.01 in each of the\nfirst three quarters, and $0.07 to $0.10 in MRID acquisition charges are\nexpected to be spread out through the year, with $0.01 in the first quarter,\n$0.02 to $0.04 in the second quarter and the balance in the second half of the\nyear. Epstein noted that guidance has been adjusted for the recent stock split\nyet remains consistent with earlier projections on an overall basis, but\nadjusted slightly for estimated timing on the charges to be actually incurred.\n\nEpstein also explained that a non-cash gain of $0.03 ($1.1 million) was\nrecognized in the first quarter as an adjustment to an environmental reserve\nestablished with the divestiture of IGC-Advanced Superconductors (a business\nfocused on traditional, low- temperature superconductors) in 2001.\n\nFORECAST FOR FISCAL YEAR REMAINS STRONG, Q2 OUTLOOK PROVIDED\n\n"Based on the strength of our traditional and acquired businesses and the growth\nwe see ahead in our core market segments, we remain highly confident that we\nwill meet our earlier projections of revenue for fiscal 2005 of about $300\nmillion and earnings per share on a normalized basis--excluding\nacquisition-related and non-cash performance-based stock compensation and other\ncharges or benefits--to be in the $1.03 to $1.10 range," Epstein said. "While\nour first-quarter SG&A (selling, general and administrative expense) was up in\ntotal dollars, it was in line with our evolving operating model, and we believe\nwe are now well positioned to receive incrementally accelerating benefits from\nrevenue gains in the long term from a relatively fixed base of facilities,\nengineering and manufacturing costs.\n\n"Our current outlook for the `new Intermagnetics\' second quarter is for record\nrevenue and profit, with growth in the range of 25 percent to what we just\nachieved during the first quarter."\n                                     -More-\n\n', u'\n\n\nCONFERENCE CALL TODAY\n\nThe company will discuss its first-quarter results as well as other developments\nduring a conference call today beginning at 11 a.m. EDT.
