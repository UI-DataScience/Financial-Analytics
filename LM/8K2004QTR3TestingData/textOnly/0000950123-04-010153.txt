Total chain-wide net sales (which include aggregate net\nsales for the collective group of Company-owned and franchise stores) increased\n6.3% to $244.6\xa0million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, up from $230.2\nmillion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Same-store net sales for\nCompany-owned stores decreased 4.7% (on a comparative 14-week basis', u'1', u'), compared\nwith an increase of 5.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.

The increase in net income was primarily due to increased net\nsales at Company-owned stores, higher merchandise margin, and lower store\noperating and selling expenses in the fourth quarter of 2004, as well as the\npreviously mentioned charges incurred last year. These improvements were\npartially offset by higher general and administrative expenses.\n\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 32.1% for the\nfourth quarter of fiscal 2004 from 30.3% in the same period last year primarily\ndue to a 2.8% increase in gross merchandise margin, partially offset by a 1.0%\nincrease in occupancy costs as a percent of sales. The increase in gross\nmerchandise margin resulted from a reduction in promotional pricing. The\nincrease in occupancy costs as a percent of sales is due to normal expense\nincreases in a period where sales growth was more limited. Store operating and\nselling expenses as a percent of sales decreased to 21.9% for the fourth\nquarter of fiscal 2004 from 23.4% in the same period last year, primarily due\nto an increase in sales, a decrease in third party labor costs associated with\nthe store physical inventories, and flat payroll and advertising expense\ncompared with last year.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0General and administrative expenses increased 19.1% to $11.4\xa0million (9.4%\nof net sales) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 from $9.5\xa0million (8.3% of\nnet sales) in the same period last year, primarily due to increased corporate\npayroll to support Party City\x92s strategic initiatives, professional fees and\ntraining related to the implementation of the new information system, and\nprofessional fees for the Company\x92s logistics and information systems\ninitiatives.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Franchise profit contribution was $2.7\xa0million, remaining relatively flat\nwith last year, with an increase in franchise royalties resulting from an\nincreased franchise store base offset by increased expenses allocated to the\nfranchise segment during the quarter.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Net interest expense was $80,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004\ncompared with $73,000 in the same period last year.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\n', u'\n', u' PAGEBREAK ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'Full Year Results', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Net sales for Company-owned stores increased 6.9% to $496.1\xa0million for\nfiscal 2004, up from $464.3\xa0million for fiscal 2003.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2004 was 33.0%,\nrelatively flat with last year, with a 0.4% increase in gross merchandise\nmargin offset by an equal increase in occupancy costs as a percent of sales.\nMerchandise clearance and inventory reduction initiatives throughout fiscal\n2004 led to a 15.4% decrease in average inventory per store compared with the\nsame period last year. Store operating and selling expense as a percentage of\nnet sales for fiscal 2004 decreased to 22.8% from 23.3% for the same period\nlast year, primarily due to lower payroll expense. General and administrative\nexpense as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2004 was 8.0% as compared with\n7.0% for the same period last year primarily due to the $4.1\xa0million litigation\ncharge recorded in the third quarter of Fiscal 2004, relating to the tentative\nsettlement of a California class action litigation regarding overtime wage and\nhour laws.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Franchise profit contribution increased 9.5% to $12.9\xa0million for fiscal\n2004 as compared with $11.8\xa0million for the same period last year.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Net interest expense decreased to $471,000 for fiscal 2004 from $4.0\nmillion for the same period last year, primarily due to the repurchase of\noutstanding senior notes during the second quarter of fiscal 2003 as well as\nlower average borrowings during fiscal 2004.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Store Growth and Chain Update', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0During fiscal 2004, the Company opened nine stores and closed two stores,\ncompared with 35 openings (including an acquisition of 11 stores from a third\nparty and two stores from a franchisee) and two store closings during the same\nperiod last year.

Thank you for joining us today to discuss Party City\x92s\nresults for the fourth quarter and for fiscal year 2004. I am generally pleased\nwith our financial accomplishments and very pleased with our strategic\naccomplishments for \x9104.\n\n', u'We reached $1\xa0billion in total chain-wide sales. We reported earnings of 2.1\nmillion or 11 cents per diluted share for 2004 fourth quarter, and earnings of\n13.9\xa0million or 71 cents per diluted share for the fiscal year. That\x92s a 15\npercent year-over-year increase.\n\n\n', u'Linda will discuss the reason behind our earnings growth shortly. But major\nfactors are increased overall sales, better merchandising margins and lower\nstore operating and selling expenses.\n\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' Begin Table Head ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u' End Table Head ', u'\n', u' Begin Table Body ', u'\n', u'\n', u'Thomson StreetEvents', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'streetevents@thomson.com\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'617.603.7900\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'www.streetevents.com', u'\n', u'\n', u' End Table Body ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa9 2004 Thomson Financial.

We began to make\nsignificant transitions in products, brand image, people, customer service and\nbusiness processes that we believe will drive growth, profitability and\nshareholder value over the long term. However, much of our work is not yet\nvisible in our stores.\n\n\n', u'Beginning with Halloween, the impact of packaging graphics and coordinated\nassortments will become more evident. Today, I will talk about some of the\ninitiatives that were successfully implemented in fiscal \x9104 and share with you\nsome of our key objectives for fiscal \x9105.\n\n\n', u'First, however, I want to comment on the announcement that our Chief Financial\nOfficer, Linda Siluk, will be leaving Party City next month to pursue other\nopportunities. We respect Linda\x92s decision, although we do regret that she is\nleaving. Linda has committed to staying through mid-September.\n\n\n', u'We are fortunate to have an extremely accomplished successor who will join us\nin September, as well as a very solid financial management team. I will be able\nto tell you more about our new CFO as soon as he has transitioned his\nresponsibilities from his current employer.\n\n\n', u'Now, let me ask Linda to review our financial performances. And then we will\ntalk further about our 2004 accomplishments and future initiatives. Linda?\n\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Linda Siluk ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Financial Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you Nancy. Let\x92s now discuss our results for the quarter and the\nfiscal year ended July 3. I just want to point out to you that the financial\nresults presented in this conference call for the fourth quarter and the year\nended July\xa03, 2004 are based on a 14-week and a 53-week period, while the\nfinancial results for the comparable period last year are based on a 13-week\nand a 52-week period respectively.\n\n', u'For the quarter, our Company-owned net sales increased 4.2\xa0percent. This\nincrease is due to a 21.8\xa0percent increase in sales volumes due to the new\nstores joining the Company this past year, partially offset by the negative\nsame-store sales of 4.7\xa0percent.\n\n\n', u'Same-store net sales decreased on a regional basis 2\xa0percent in the West, 3.7\nin the East and 7.5\xa0percent in Central. The Company opened one new store and\nclosed 1 store during the fourth quarter, and opened 2 new stores and closed 1\nnew store in the same period last year.\n\n\n', u'Our cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses increased 1.5\xa0percent. This is\ndue to increased sales volumes. Our gross profit dollars increased 10.5\npercent. This is due to overall increases in gross merchandise margins and\nreduced markdown activity, partially offset by increased occupancy costs. Our\nstore operating expenses decreased 2.7\xa0percent for the quarter, to 26.4\xa0million\nfrom 27.1\xa0million.\n\n\n', u'Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 21.9\xa0percent from 23.4\npercent last year as a result of increased sales, a decrease in store physical\ninventory accounting costs due to the inventory level being reduced, and\nefficiencies in payroll and advertising spending.\n\n\n', u'Store contribution increased to 12.3\xa0million from 7.9\xa0million last year. Mature\nstores played an important role in the increase, rising 3.3\xa0million or 74\npercent of the total increase, while new stores in their first or second\nHalloween season produced a $600,000 increase compared to last year. The 12\nstores in the Seattle market that were acquired in 2002 rose $250,000 in store\ncontributions, or 5.7\xa0percent of the increase compared to last year.\n\n\n', u'Our general and administrative expenses increased 19.1\xa0percent to 11\xa0million \x97\n$11.4\xa0million from 9.5\xa0million last year. G&A expenses increased as a\npercentage of sales to 9.4\xa0percent from 8.3 last year. This increase is\nprimarily due to increased corporate staffing and professional fees and\ntraining related to the implementation of our new information systems, as well\nas the development of our logistics and other systems.\n\n\n', u'Our franchise revenue increased 9\xa0percent for the quarter. This is due to\nroyalty growth from 18 stores opening in fiscal 2004. Expenses related to our\nfranchise segment increased 23.1\xa0percent. As a percentage of franchise revenue,\nfranchise expenses were 41.9\xa0percent for the quarter as compared with 37.1 for\nthe same period last year.\n\n\n', u'Franchise profit (ph)\xa0contribution dollars remained flat with last year at 2.7\nmillion. The increase in royalty revenue was offset by an increase in the\nexpenses allocated to franchise segment during the quarter.\n\n\n', u'Our interest expense increased approximately 9.6\xa0percent from 73,000 to 80,000.\nWe had no borrowings at the end of fiscal 2004. Our tax rate for the quarter\nand for the year is 40.5\xa0percent compared to 40\xa0percent last year. This change\nin the tax rate is primarily due to an increase in overall state taxes.\n\n\n', u'Our net income for the quarter was 2.1\xa0million compared to 586,000 last year.\nThe fiscal year 2003 fourth quarter results included charges of approximately\n2.5\xa0million after tax related to initiatives and markdowns.\n\n\n', u'On a per-share basis, our diluted earnings per share for the quarter were 11\ncents this year compared to 3 cents for the comparable quarter last year.\n\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' Begin Table Head ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u' End Table Head ', u'\n', u' Begin Table Body ', u'\n', u'\n', u'Thomson StreetEvents', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'streetevents@thomson.com\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'617.603.7900\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'www.streetevents.com', u'\n', u'\n', u' End Table Body ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa9 2004 Thomson Financial.

For the 12\nmonths ending July\xa03, our Company-owned net sales increased 6.9\xa0percent. This\nis due to the 6.3\xa0percent increase from new stores and same-store sales\nincrease of just over flat of 0.6\xa0percent.\n\n\n', u'Same-store sales increased 1.9\xa0percent in the West region, 1.4 in the East\nregion, and decreased 1.1\xa0percent in the Central region. The Company opened 9\nnew stores and close 2 stores during the 12\xa0months ended July\xa03, 2004.\n\n\n', u'Our cost of goods sold and occupancy expenses increased 6.8\xa0percent during\nfiscal 2004. This is due to increased sales volume and an increase in the\nnumber of stores over last year. Our gross profit dollars increased 7\xa0percent.\nThe gross margin percent remained constant at 33\xa0percent compared to last year.\nThis is due mainly to an increase in gross merchandise margin offset by an\nincrease in occupancy costs.\n\n\n', u'Our store operating expenses increased 4.6\xa0percent for the year due to the\nincrease in sales volume and the increase in the number of stores.\n\n\n', u'Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 22.8\xa0percent from 23.3\npercent last year. This is primarily due to efficiencies in payroll expenses,\nbut also due to a decrease in store opening expenses and grand opening\nadvertising. This year, we incurred about $500,000 in new opening and grand\nopening advertising expenses, and last year incurred $1.6\xa0million.\n\n\n', u'Store contributions increased to 50.5\xa0million from 44.8\xa0million last year. New\nstores produced a $4.6\xa0million increase or 54\xa0percent this increase. Mature\nstores reported an increase of 1.2\xa0million or 21\xa0percent of the increase. The\n12 stores in the Seattle market acquired in 2002 produced 936,000 more in store\ncontribution this year compared to last year.\n\n\n', u'Our G&A expenses increased 22.1\xa0percent. G&A expenses increased as a percentage\nof sales to 8\xa0percent from 7\xa0percent last year. The increase is primarily due\nto increased corporate payroll, information systems, logistics and compliance\ninitiatives.\n\n\n', u'In addition, we reported a charge of $4.1\xa0million in the third quarter related\nto the tentative settlement of a lawsuit related to California overtime wage\nand hour laws.\n\n\n', u'Our interest expense decreased to 471,000 from $4\xa0million in the previous year.\nAs you will recall, we made a payment of our senior notes in the second quarter\nof fiscal 2003. On an overall basis, our borrowings in fiscal 2004 were lower\nas well.\n\n\n', u'Our net income for fiscal 2004 was 13.9\xa0million, compared to 12.1\xa0million in\nfiscal 2003. On a per-share basis, our diluted earnings per share for fiscal\n2004 were 71 cents compared to diluted earnings per share of 62 cents in fiscal\n2003.\n\n\n', u'Now going to our balance sheet, we ended the year with 27.8\xa0million in cash.\nOur inventories have decreased to $57.4\xa0million. This is about a 15.4\xa0percent\ndecrease in average store inventories over the prior year.\n\n\n', u'We have been identifying and clearing out discontinued merchandise on an\naccelerated basis. Our inventory turns this year have improved to just under\nthree times, compared to about 2.5 times last year.\n\n\n', u'Our capital budget for fiscal 2005 is targeted at approximately $20\xa0million,\ncompared to our spending this past year of about 16. Our accounts payable have\ndecreased slightly in contrast with the decrease in inventory. This is really\ndue to the disposal of the old discontinued merchandise with much fresher\nmerchandise on hand.\n\n\n', u'Our fixed assets have decreased from 52.8\xa0million to $48.8\xa0million, generally\ndue to the continued depreciation of assets, an increase of 9 new stores and\nassets acquired for new systems. Nancy, that summarizes the financial results\nfor the quarter and 12\xa0months ended July\xa03, 2004.\n\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Nancy Pedot ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Executive Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thanks Linda. I would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank you\nfor your contributions to Party City and your commitment to stay with us during\nthe transition to your successor. I know that we all wish you all the best in\nyour new opportunity.\n\n', u'Now I would like to talk about our progress in 2004 and our ongoing transition,\nespecially in the areas of product, brand revitalization, people, customer\nservice and our business processes.\n\n\n', u'In the product area, we continue to focus on developing new coordinated\nassortments based on a combination of exclusive products and stronger\nmerchandising presentation. The goal is to give our customer the different and\nexciting choices and ideas, while providing consistently better value and with\nultimately producing better margins.\n\n\n', u'The first area that we were able to impact was our summer assortments,\nresulting comps in the high teens and a considerable increase in gross margin\ndollars. The combination of new exclusive designs, coordinated products,\nspecific consistent pricing, cleaner merchandising presentation, we are better\nable to maximize the business in this area.\n\n\n', u'We will be implementing the same assortment concepts in in-store execution for\nboth Halloween and Christmas, with the additional graphic and store signage\npackage correspondingly.\n\n\n', u'The next area that we will see the impact of our product strategy will be\nHalloween. Our entire Halloween party presentation is new\n\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' Begin Table Head ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u' End Table Head ', u'\n', u' Begin Table Body ', u'\n', u'\n', u'Thomson StreetEvents', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'streetevents@thomson.com\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'617.603.7900\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'www.streetevents.com', u'\n', u'\n', u' End Table Body ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa9 2004 Thomson Financial.

And roughly 60\xa0percent of the party products will be\nParty City exclusive.\n\n\n', u'The full Halloween line will be back in the stores in early September. And to\nmake the most of our new Halloween products, we have added a number of\ninitiatives and innovative marketing and promotional programs. Softness in our\ncomps in fiscal year 2004 was mostly in our everyday or our non-seasonal\nbusinesses, where we have not yet implemented the new product assortment.\n\n\n', u'For that reason, with our new merchandising team our top priority for fiscal\nyear \x9105 will be to re-merchandise the core assortments in our store. New\neveryday programs will build on the approach that worked well for us recently\n\x97 well coordinated assortments, some with exclusive designs; price points that\nconsistently offer value to our customers; and a stronger overall merchandise\npresentation.\n\n\n', u'You\x92ll see a new sports program that is in the process of being set up this\nnext week, as well as a new gift for a gift-wrap presentation and exclusive\ndesigns in our fall tableware, which will be in our stores by early September.\n\n\n', u'In November, we will launch our new catering and table (ph)\xa0presentations. And\nin December, we will introduce new fashion tableware \x97 again, exclusive\ndesigns that will transition into the spring and summer season.\n\n\n', u'We will be setting around 30 additional new planograms between January and\nMarch, at which point will be on track to deliver an ongoing schedule of new\nplanograms and fresh merchandise to Party City.\n\n\n', u'The merchandise initiatives are key to our previously stated goal of achieving\nmid single digit growth in the comparable store sales in the second half of\nfiscal year \x9105.\n\n\n', u'Brand revitalization, which was another key initiative and another area where\nwe\x92re making a major transition \x97 we believe that the key to being a great\nbrand is to be the source of products ideas and great service for every\noccasion. Our creative director, Susan Hockbaum (ph), has designed new\npackaging for many of our Party City stores and our in-store graphic signage we\nthink make it easier to shop.\n\n\n', u'We also have begun to upgrade the presentation in our stores. To date, we have\naisle cut-throughs. As you know, in many of our stores we have extremely long\naisles. And we have completed aisle cut-throughs in 112 of our stores, so our\ncustomers can navigate the stores more easily.\n\n\n', u'They also help us to merchandise differently, showing more merchandise on end\ncap. Additional storage has been identified for the cut-throughs. And all the\nwork should be completed by the end of fiscal 2005, with the exception of\nCalifornia were we have earthquake standards and the fixtures are bolted down.\n\n\n', u'We\x92ve also worked on a designed for a new prototype store that will be the\nformat for our stores opening in fiscal 2005. We have tried to open about 5 to\n7 new stores, and this will position us for our largest scale rollout in fiscal\n\x9106.\n\n\n', u'Additionally, we commissioned a marketing research study to better identify\ngrowth opportunity, market segments, and competitive intelligence. This will be\nused as an overall roadmap for corporate growth to add strategies in the\nfuture.\n\n\n', u'As you know, we filled a number of positions that were essential for our\nstrategic transition, such as \x97 our Chief Operating Officer, Rick Griner, who\njoined us in February; Lisa Laube, our Chief Merchandising Officer. And we also\nbegan to establish an in-house creative department, starting with our Creative\nDirector, Susan Hockbaum.\n\n\n', u'We added, also, many people to sort our merchandising and strategic initiatives\nthroughout the organization. To date, in merchandising, we\x92ve added 7 new\npeople; 12 in planning an allocation; and 4 in logistics.\n\n\n', u'Filling the Vice President of Marketing position is also an objective for 2005.\nHowever, we currently have a consultant, Susan Weiner (ph), who has a senior\nmarketing executive experience in companies such as Linens \x91n Things, Pearle\nVision and Garden Ridge, where she was Chief Marketing Officer.\n\n\n', u'Our initiatives in customer service will require long-term cultural shift. But\nwe took some exciting first steps this year. We hired a full-time Director of\nLearning. And we launched a Sales and Service training program and took it on\nthe road into our stores in every region, as well as our franchise stores.\n\n\n', u'I would like to now talk about the changes that we\x92ve made in our business\nprocesses.\n\n\n', u'Starting first with the many accomplishments in our IT division headed by Steve\nShiva \x97 and I would say that all of the initiatives in IT were a very strong\ntotal Company effort, with every division spending a tremendous amount of time\nin the execution of these initiatives.\n\n\n', u'Focus (ph)\xa0Phase 1, which was implemented in November \x9102, was the latest\nrelease of the JDA (ph)\xa0retail system PMN (ph). We also put together all the\ngroundwork for Focus Phase II. And that is currently in process and will be\nimplemented. It\x92s planned to be complete, on time, and on budgets in September.\nAnd it has an\nadditional PMM (ph)\xa0module, including stock ledger, invoice matching, cycle\ncounting, EDI and additional batch reports.\n\n\n', u'Another very long collaborative effort \x97 and congratulations both to our store\noperation as well as our IT team with the implementation of the Traverse City\ncorporate store POS system.\n\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' Begin Table Head ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u' End Table Head ', u'\n', u' Begin Table Body ', u'\n', u'\n', u'Thomson StreetEvents', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'streetevents@thomson.com\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'617.603.7900\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'www.streetevents.com', u'\n', u'\n', u' End Table Body ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa9 2004 Thomson Financial.

Additionally, our RF performance improved from on average of 30\nseconds to 3.\n\n\n', u'We also have Supply Chain Phase I, which is set for implementation this\nSeptember. It\x92s planned to complete and on time. The Supply Chain Phase I is a\nsystem implementation of activities to support our logistics initiatives in our\n2 distribution centers.\n\n\n', u'And also, the Oracle Financial System upgrade was completed on time and on\nbudget. Congratulations to those teams.\n\n\n', u'Additionally, Rick Griner, Miles Tetter (ph), our logistics and planning and\nallocation teams have done a tremendous job on our logistics systems\ninitiative. We expect significant supply chain cost reductions in fiscal year\n\x9105 and even more dramatic savings going forward.\n\n\n', u'We are now our receiving merchandise in 2 DCs, or distribution centers, one on\neach coast. This is followed \x97 this was followed by an intensive effort to\nevaluate and select the vendors, negotiate on operating services agreements,\nand implement a warehousing transportation management system.\n\n\n', u'We also initiated a preferred carrier process earlier this year and achieved\nlower negotiated transportation rates, better visibility on deliveries, and\nhigher service levels.\n\n\n', u'We previously said that the logistics and related merchandising initiatives\nshould produce a 100 basis point increase in gross margin for fiscal 2005. And\nwe continue to believe that this is realistic.\n\n\n', u'To wrap up this overview, we made solid progress in 2004. And we have a clear\nvision of what we need to do to complete our transition. Here are some of our\nmajor initiatives for fiscal \x9105 that will move this transition forward.\n\n\n', u'We will expand the product transformation to everyday merchandise, as I\nmentioned earlier, which will be a huge project for us. Having fresh, unique\neveryday product is crucial to our profitability during many times of the year.\nAnd our goal is to complete the product transition by this spring, with\nappropriate planogram changes is to support the new line.\n\n\n', u'We will also begin to relay all stores beginning in the third quarter of fiscal\nyear \x9105 with the new planograms, better adjacencies, new merchandising\ntechniques and cleaner store graphics that will promote our new products.\n\n\n', u'We also expect to open a minimum of 5 and perhaps as many as 7 new prototype\nstores beginning in spring \x9105. We commissioned a real estate study to help\ntarget the most promising markets and help guide our store expansion efforts.\nThis will result in a comprehensive store expansion plan for fiscal \x9106.\n\n\n', u'We will complete Phase I of the logistics initiative in the first quarter of\n\x9105. This will support weekly scheduling and store deliveries. We do\nstore-related (ph)\xa0requirements and improved inventory turnover. We also are\nworking on Phase II of the logistics plan which will provide for REPAC\ncapability.\n\n\n', u'With the advent of the POS system and logistics initiatives, we are working to\ndevelop more effective reports and forecasting tools to provide our merchants\nwith information to support our better business decision.\n\n\n', u'We will also be creating a product lifecycle model to help us determine when to\ndiscontinue and mark down products and further improve our inventory management\nsell through and margin.\n\n\n', u'Product procurement is another major opportunity to improve margins while\noffering our customers a better quality value. There are a number of merchants\nthat recently visited Asia \x97 our merchants \x97 and we\x92re beginning the\nformation of a product sourcing and development team to make the most of our\nopportunity.\n\n\n', u'Our capital budget for fiscal \x9104 is targeted at 20\xa0million and includes\nsupporting the initiatives that we\x92ve outlined above. Clearly, we\x92re still in\nthe midst of transition. We are confident that the progress made so far will\nstrengthen our operations, our competitive position, and ultimately our\nfinancial performance.\n\n\n', u'We continue to believe that the benefits of our initiatives will be more\nvisible in the second half of fiscal year \x9105. At that time, the shift in the\nproduct assortments and the store relay should be reflected in our customer\nshopping experience. And we should begin to experience gains from our logistics\ninitiative.\n\n\n', u'Now, we will be pleased to respond to your questions.\n\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' Begin Table Head ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u' End Table Head ', u'\n', u' Begin Table Body ', u'\n', u'\n', u'Thomson StreetEvents', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'streetevents@thomson.com\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'617.603.7900\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'www.streetevents.com', u'\n', u'\n', u' End Table Body ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa9 2004 Thomson Financial.

King & Associates \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Looks like you came in with nice gross margins, despite the transition to\nEDLPs. Is that going to be sustainable?

King & Associates \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I mean, did you take certain steps to protect margin, even though it can\nhave a \x97 sometimes produce a negative impact? I mean it\x92s very impressive, but\nyou had strong margins. Hopefully it continues. But is there something you\x92re\ndoing to make it work better than it usually does?\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Nancy Pedot ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Executive Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As you know Gary, we re-priced lots of product in April in our stores.

The sports program is megaphones and party sports products.\n(laughter)\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Gary Giblen ', u'- C. L.

King & Associates \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay, and then buying better was an opportunity identified at the investor\nmeeting. And it could\x92ve been 100 basis points or a good deal more than that.\nSo how\x92s that developing?\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Nancy Pedot ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Executive Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We\x92re working fast and furiously on our new assortment for spring \x9105 as I\nmentioned in the earlier comments. We are developing product that is exclusive\nto Party City as well as coordinating it with products that are available from\nour suppliers.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Gary Giblen ', u'- C. L. King & Associates \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. And still a couple more \x97 the corporate SG&A line was pretty a\nmajor increase sequentially. So are there some nonrecurring parts of that? And\ncan you roughly quantify any non-recurrings?\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Nancy Pedot ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Executive Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We did have some legal and professional fee spots \x97 you want to speak to\nthat?\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Rick Griner ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Operating Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Gary, in the legal and professional fees side, we\x92ve made some investments\nin store prototypes that while they may be continuing\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' Begin Table Head ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u' End Table Head ', u'\n', u' Begin Table Body ', u'\n', u'\n', u'Thomson StreetEvents', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'streetevents@thomson.com\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'617.603.7900\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'www.streetevents.com', u'\n', u'\n', u' End Table Body ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa9 2004 Thomson Financial.

L. King & Associates \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay, so it\x92s not going to be \x97 so this amount of dollars will not\nnecessarily \x97 in other words, 11.4\xa0million is not a run rate for the quarterly\ncorporate SG&A? I mean it\x92s probably higher than \x97? (multiple speakers)\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Rick Griner ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Operating Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think we will see some investment going into \x9105, some continued\ninvestment in trying to finalize the \x97 both the corporate headcount, if you\nwill, as we complete the transitioning process and get all the final people\npieces in place in order to fully implement the merchandising and logistics\ninitiatives.\n\n', u'So there will be some continued investment on the headcount side and some\ncontinued investment in \x9105 on the professional and technology side. We believe\nthat will level off at the second half of \x9105.\n\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Gary Giblen ', u'- C. L. King & Associates \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay great. Then final question \x97 I mean somebody has to ask it, so\nsomebody \x97 so I will be \x97 can you give us a flavor for comps? We have 7\xa0weeks\nsince the end of the fourth quarter, so you know, a pretty meaningful period.\nSo, how\x92s biz?\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Nancy Pedot ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Executive Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0At this point, Gary, we\x92re not commenting on the quarter \x97 the current\nquarter.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Gary Giblen ', u'- C. L. King & Associates \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. Even \x97 can you even give us some subjective thing \x97 good, bad,\nindifferent?\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Nancy Pedot ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Executive Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think that we\x92re \x97 this is still a transition. We\x92re in the process \x97\nas I mentioned earlier, we have everyday product that is not new in our stores.\nWe are setting up Halloween. And things seem to be moving forward on time that\n\x97 we\x92re anxious to get that set up and to begin to see the results of our new\nmerchandising presentation.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0So Halloween, holiday, our seasonal products for the next two quarters will be\nthe new way of merchandising. And we will transition pockets of the core\nassortments \x97 the ones that I mentioned earlier \x97 the new sports line that\x92s\ncoming in, the fall tableware line that we will be receiving and candleware,\nand the catering \x97 new catering setup.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Gary Giblen ', u'- C. L. King & Associates \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. Thank you. Very helpful.\n\n\n', u'Operator', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Dennis Telzrow, Stephens Inc.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Dennis Telzrow ', u'- Stephens Inc \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Nancy, you went through a lot of stuff there. I appreciate it. A couple of\nquick questions. On the Phase I logistics, I didn\x92t catch when that is going\nin. And could you elaborate exactly what Phase I is? How many products are\ngoing to be delivered to the store through the logistics center on the initial\nPhase I?\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Nancy Pedot ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Executive Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes. Actually, I didn\x92t mention the people in the room with us today, but\nRick Griner is here with us as our Chief Operating Officer. And our Vice\nPresident of Finance, Bob Almarini (ph), as well as Linda Siluk and our Chief\nMerchandising Officer, Lisa Laube. So, I would like Rick to address the\nlogistics. He is our logistics (technical difficulty)\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Rick Griner ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Operating Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Good morning Dennis. Phase I actually began with receipt of product right\non schedule in July 6 in our first distribution center, which is located in\nMechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. Two weeks later, we began receiving product into\nour Fontana, California distribution center. We will begin shipping next week.\n\n', u'We have been working down the stock assortment that was in our prior\ndistributor to an acceptable level. We wanted to continue to ship that to our\nstores as long as possible before switching over to our own DCs.\n\n\n', u'Phase I begins with approximately \x97 let\x92s say 1000 to 1200 SKUs. And\nthroughout the year, we will be converting more and more SKUs. And these are\nSKUs that are single item, single carton\n\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' Begin Table Head ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u' End Table Head ', u'\n', u' Begin Table Body ', u'\n', u'\n', u'Thomson StreetEvents', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'streetevents@thomson.com\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'617.603.7900\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'www.streetevents.com', u'\n', u'\n', u' End Table Body ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa9 2004 2002 Thomson Financial.

That will continue throughout \x9105 and perhaps into early\n\x9106 as we move into the Phase II distribution program.\n\n\n', u'Also concurrent with Phase I will be the development of a cross docking\nprogram. As you know, we now have a lot of merchandise that is repacked in\nvarious vendor facilities and then direct shipped to stores. This repacked\nmerchandise from some of these vendors shortly, Amscan being the first, will\nconvert in mid-September to going through our 2 DCs, and will be coupled with\nthe single SKU, single carton merchandise.\n\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Dennis Telzrow ', u'- Stephens Inc \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you. One other question \x97 2 other questions. One on advertising \x97\nare you doing any sort of tweaking in the sense that you have weaned yourself\noff of being more promotional? Or are you sort of massaging that a little bit,\ngiven the sort of trends in same-store sales?\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Nancy Pedot ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Executive Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We are always watching our transition. Yes, we are also very focused on\nour advertising and watching our circulars and our message to our customers.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Dennis Telzrow ', u'- Stephens Inc \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Last question. I thought your store in Watauga was very nice. Is that\nclose to your new prototype \x97 Watauga, Texas?\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Nancy Pedot ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Executive Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, yes. It is really a \x97 we didn\x92t want to open our own store\nprototype. So we put that together in about a month. It has some things that\nwould be reflected in our new store. But it would kind of our transition,\nworking with what we did have available and what we could use to change some\nthings.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0So you saw higher ceilings, better lighting, kind of a more neutral store so\nthat the product would stand out. But it is not indicative, necessarily, of our\nnew prototype. The in-store graphics are, and the logo is.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Dennis Telzrow ', u'- Stephens Inc \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Well, I thought the balloon station was particularly attractive.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Nancy Pedot ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Executive Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Well, good.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Dennis Telzrow ', u'- Stephens Inc \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thanks a lot.\n\n\n', u'Operator', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Reid Walker, Walker Smith Capital.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Reid Walker ', u'- Walker Smith Capital \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thanks a lot for all the detail. And great work on getting the\npoint-of-sale executed along with the first step of the excel (ph)\nimplementation on the distribution side. I have got a question. It\x92s nice to\nsee the gross margin pick up 32\xa0percent. And I just want to follow-up on the\n100 basis point improvement in gross margin from the better distribution with\nexcel. Those are two separate segments, correct? And most of that is\ncontractual, just on the saving and shipping from doing less FedEx and UPS to\nthe storefront, correct?\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Rick Griner ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Operating Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The 100 points that we referenced is a combination of not only the\ndistribution issues (technical difficulty) but other merchandising initiatives.\nSo I want to make that clear. But yes, primarily what we\x92re seeing at this\nstage of the game in Phase I are direct freight savings.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Reid Walker ', u'- Walker Smith Capital \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Will we have any of the direct freight savings in the gross margin\nimprovement for this quarter that we just reported, correct?\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Rick Griner ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Operating Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0No.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Linda Siluk ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Financial Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0No (laughter)\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Reid Walker ', u'- Walker Smith Capital \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0What was the answer, I\x92m sorry?\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Nancy Pedot ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Executive Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The answer was (laughter).\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' Begin Table Head ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u' End Table Head ', u'\n', u' Begin Table Body ', u'\n', u'\n', u'Thomson StreetEvents', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'streetevents@thomson.com\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'617.603.7900\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'www.streetevents.com', u'\n', u'\n', u' End Table Body ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa9 2004 2002 Thomson Financial.

Then, I have a wide variety of things\nthat are available to me that \x97 when I have something to announce and I\x92m able\nto announce it, I\x92m sure you\x92ll find out.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Laura Richardson ', u'- BB&T Capital Markets \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0And do you know with the new CFO, is there going to be any likelihood of\nchanging some of the communication strategies, like maybe guidance, for\nexample?\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Linda Siluk ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Financial Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think when we have our new financial executive on board, we will be able\nto talk some more about that as we progress. But I think that our change in\nInvestor Relations is not as much focused on a change of financial executive as\nit is really the Company evolving.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Laura Richardson ', u'- BB&T Capital Markets \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay, is this person is a CFO already in a public company?\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Linda Siluk ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Financial Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We really can\x92t comment any more than that.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Laura Richardson ', u'- BB&T Capital Markets \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay, okay. I thought you might be able to say that.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Linda Siluk ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Financial Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We\x92re excited to have him join us. And he\x92s a very experienced financial\nexecutive.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Laura Richardson ', u'- BB&T Capital Markets \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay, good. Just a couple of follow-ups to questions Gary was trying to\nask. I wasn\x92t clear. When he was asking about, basically, comps right now, and\nI know you don\x92t want to say that. But Nancy, I\x92m thought you might have been\ntrying to say, from a merchandise perspective, this quarter that we\x92re in right\nnow is more of an everyday quarter like the fourth quarter was. And the real\nbig newness in product is coming in December quarter. Is that fair to assume?\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Nancy Pedot ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Executive Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes, we will begin to transition our everyday product really in third and\nfourth quarter of fiscal year \x9105.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Laura Richardson ', u'- BB&T Capital Markets \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Right. So, at this time of year there is no major season driving the\nbusiness?\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Nancy Pedot ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Executive Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Right. We\x92re still in transition.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Laura Richardson ', u'- BB&T Capital Markets \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' Begin Table Head ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u' End Table Head ', u'\n', u' Begin Table Body ', u'\n', u'\n', u'Thomson StreetEvents', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'streetevents@thomson.com\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'617.603.7900\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'www.streetevents.com', u'\n', u'\n', u' End Table Body ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa9 2004 2002 Thomson Financial.

And then, in terms of the G&A, I wasn\x92t quite sure what your\nresponse was to that, either. It sounded like maybe the 11\xa0million is a\nreasonable run rate, at least for the next couple of quarters, and that you\x92re\nstill adding to the headquarters staff. And then there maybe some of these\nprofessional fees (multiple speakers)\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Nancy Pedot ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Executive Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Associated with our initiatives?\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Laura Richardson ', u'- BB&T Capital Markets \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Right.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Nancy Pedot ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Executive Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Laura Richardson ', u'- BB&T Capital Markets \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Any idea how long we\x92re going to see that type of G&A expense?\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Nancy Pedot ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Executive Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We\x92re going to continue \x97 Linda, you can maybe address this. But we\x92re\ngoing to continue to fill in the organization as planned. You won\x92t certainly\nin \x9106 see the kind of acceleration that you see with regard to the people that\nwe\x92re hiring. We should start to level off into a more normal growth rate in\n\x9106. But we still have some positions to fill in \x9105.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Linda Siluk ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Financial Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Just to make sure we repeat that, because we all look at the same kinds of\nthings \x97 is that \x9106 versus \x9105 won\x92t have the year-over-year increase that\nyou\x92ll see \x9105 versus \x9104, or \x9104 versus \x9103. But there is a maintenance level\nthat we need to get to. And we will get there by the continued increase to our\ncorporate staff to execute these initiatives.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Linda Siluk ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Financial Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0We said the kind of the \x97 maintain (multiple speakers) through \x9105 as\nwell. But it will be an increase over \x9104, because \x9104 was low in the\nbeginning. (multiple speakers) So the year-over-year increased \x9105 versus \x9104\nwill be noted. But the run rate will be similar to what we talked about. \x9106\nversus \x9105 will not be as dramatic as we have seen \x9105 to \x9104 or \x9104 to \x9103.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Laura Richardson ', u'- BB&T Capital Markets \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. That makes sense. So, it sounds like really more of the expenses\nyou\x92re seeing from all the people you are adding and the infrastructure and the\nstudies you\x92re doing are in G&A, not in selling expense or gross margin,\nobviously, where you\x92re getting a lot of improvements.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Nancy Pedot ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Executive Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That\x92s true.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Rick Griner ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Operating Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Laura Richardson ', u'- BB&T Capital Markets \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0And then I was not also clear on the answer to that question about the\nfreight and the gross margin improvement. It sounded like you were saying the\nsame magnitude that we saw in the fourth quarter is not going to happen\nnecessarily to that degree in the first quarter. Is that what you were trying\nto say?\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Nancy Pedot ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Executive Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0No, I think that the question was whether the improvement \x97 the logistics\ninitiatives \x97 the improvement in freight that we spoke about earlier is\nreflected in these results, and not to the degree that we will see it in the\nlatter half of the year.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Laura Richardson ', u'- BB&T Capital Markets \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Okay. So things will get better in the latter half of the year is what you\nare saying.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Nancy Pedot ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Executive Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Yes.\n\n\n', u'Operator', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Bill Dezellem, Davidson Investment Advisers.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Bill Dezellem ', u'- Davidson Investment Advisers \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As you look out over the course of the next year, what do you anticipate\nto be the one or two most costly initiatives that you will be implementing?\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' Begin Table Head ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u' End Table Head ', u'\n', u' Begin Table Body ', u'\n', u'\n', u'Thomson StreetEvents', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'streetevents@thomson.com\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'617.603.7900\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'www.streetevents.com', u'\n', u'\n', u' End Table Body ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa9 2004 2002 Thomson Financial.

Costly initiatives \x97 certainly our\nlogistics initiative is \x97 I wouldn\x92t say that it is costly. But it\x92s where we\nhave a large area of investment \x97would be in our supply chain initiatives and\nin the support of those. We\x92re also \x97 store maintenance and renovations \x97\ninvesting currently. We think that\x92s important. And I think that pretty much\nsummarizes the in terms of our expenses.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Bill Dezellem ', u'- Davidson Investment Advisers \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0And if we understand correctly the logistics initiatives, although you may\nbe spending a fair amount of money on those, you are getting a return on those\ndollars in the sense that there are cost savings that are offsetting the\nexpenses to make the transition. Is that a fair perspective? Or do you\ninitially start out with costs higher than those savings?\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Linda Siluk ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Financial Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0No, this is Linda. I think there is a modest amount of startup in getting\nin. But it is pretty much as you described.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Bill Dezellem ', u'- Davidson Investment Advisers \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Thank you.\n\n\n', u'Operator', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Dan Gilmurray (ph), UBS.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Dan Gilmurray ', u'- UBS \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0In terms of \x97 I just wanted to spend a minute in terms of the\naccomplishments in the POS implementation or installation and the distribution\neffort. Nancy, when we get to Phase II on this \x97 or Rick if you are there, are\nwe going to accomplish the goal of having electronic interface, so that\nmerchandise is being pushed in the distribution center and will be freeing up\nthe store managers from having to spend time ordering merchandise? Is this\ngoing to automate the delivery process from the store manager perspective?\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Rick Griner ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Operating Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Dan, this is Rick. Yes, that is exactly true. That will begin in Phase I.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Dan Gilmurray ', u'- UBS \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0So, a certain number of your everyday merchandise (technical difficulty)\nsomewhat non-seasonal merchandise is going to turn to a push system, so store\nmanagers will no longer have to order those goods. That will free them up to\nget on the store floor and do a better job running the stores in conjunction\nwith the fact that you\x92ll \x97 at corporate, you\x92ll get better data on everyday\nPOS and everyday sales from the stores?\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Rick Griner ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Operating Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That is correct. That, as I was saying, begins in Phase I and will\ncontinue to increase with each new vendor that we convert to the Phase I in\ndistribution program. Then, once Phase II is up and operational, almost all\nitems \x97 and we\x92re talking in the very high 99\xa0percent area \x97 will be pushed.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Dan Gilmurray ', u'- UBS \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Got it. And this should also (multiple speakers) I\x92m sorry go ahead.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Nancy Pedot ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Executive Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I think we should talk about the timing of this, because it will be a\nphased in process. And it is not something that will happen in fiscal year \x9105\nin totality. There will continue to be relief, so to speak, at the store level\nwith regard to monitoring inventory. But the total transition will happen at\nthe end of Phase II.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Rick Griner ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Operating Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0That is correct. And I need to repeat my phrase of \x97 the moon and the\nstars all have to align for us to be into Phase II by the end of next summer.\nMost likely, Phase II will not come on for 18 to 24\xa0months.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Dan Gilmurray ', u'- UBS \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0I got it. In Phase I, will we be actually shipping some merchandise from\nour own distribution centers in terms of Halloween goods? Or are the Halloween\ngoods going to come in the old-fashioned way until we get further down the road\nhere?\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Rick Griner ', u'- Party City \x97 Chief Operating Officer', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This year, Halloween continues to be distributed in the old-fashioned way.\nNext year, a very, very high percentage of Halloween will be going through the\ndistribution centers.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'Dan Gilmurray ', u'- UBS \x97 Analyst', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' Begin Table Head ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u' End Table Head ', u'\n', u' Begin Table Body ', u'\n', u'\n', u'Thomson StreetEvents', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'streetevents@thomson.com\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'617.603.7900\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'www.streetevents.com', u'\n', u'\n', u' End Table Body ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa9 2004 2002 Thomson Financial.
