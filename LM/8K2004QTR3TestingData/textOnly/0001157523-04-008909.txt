PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 30, 2004--Lawson Software,\nInc. (Nasdaq:LWSN) today reported total revenues of $82.7 million for\nits fiscal 2005 first quarter ended Aug. 31, 2004, compared with\nrevenues of $88.0 million for its fiscal 2004 first quarter. License\nfee revenues were $13.3 million in the fiscal 2005 first quarter,\ncompared with $22.7 million in the fiscal 2004 first quarter. Services\nrevenues were $69.4 million in the fiscal 2005 first quarter, compared\nwith $65.3 million in the fiscal 2004 first quarter.\n    On a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, the\ncompany recorded a net loss of $417,000, or $0.00 per diluted share,\nin the fiscal 2005 first quarter, compared with net income of $3.2\nmillion, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the fiscal 2004 first quarter.\n    Based on non-GAAP financial measures, the company reported\nnon-GAAP net income of $916,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the\nfiscal 2005 first quarter, compared with non-GAAP net income of $4.0\nmillion in the fiscal 2004 first quarter, or $0.04 per diluted share.\nFiscal 2005 first quarter non-GAAP operating results exclude $2.1\nmillion of items consisting of software and intangible amortization\nrelated to acquisitions and acquired maintenance contracts, non-cash\nstock-based compensation and a restructuring charge adjustment.\n    For the details on the company\'s GAAP reported results and the\nreconciliation of GAAP operating results to non-GAAP financial\nmeasures of net income, see the financial table accompanying this news\nrelease - "SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - RECONCILIATION OF GAAP OPERATING\n(LOSS) INCOME TO NON-GAAP NET INCOME."\n    The company signed 122 deals in the quarter. Of total contracting\nactivity in the fiscal 2005 first quarter, 65 percent came from\nexisting customers and 35 percent from new customers. During the\nquarter, the company signed 12 new customers at an average selling\nprice of $428,000, compared with 19 new customers at an average\nselling price of $730,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.\n    The company\'s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\nwere $184.5 million at Aug. 31, 2004, compared with $209.0 million at\nMay 31, 2004.\n    Days sales outstanding were 61, compared with 59 in the fiscal\n2004 fourth quarter.\n    Deferred revenue and client deposits decreased $18.2 million from\nthe prior quarter, primarily because of a decrease in cash received on\nsupport billings as a result of a change in client billing cycles and\nother delayed collections. The change resulted in initially smaller\nclient invoices due to pro-rated billings in an effort to get\nindividual multiple client support billings to a common renewal date.\nDeferred revenue levels impacted by this change are expected to be\nrestored in subsequent periods during this fiscal year as billing\ncycles become synchronized and cash is collected.\n    The company also announced a plan designed to enhance operating\neffectiveness and profitability. Under the plan, the company will\ncentralize structure, consolidate leadership and reduce long-term\ncosts to realign projected expenses with anticipated revenue levels.\nThe plan includes a reduction of approximately 100 employees in the\nUnited States and the United Kingdom, which will result in a charge of\napproximately $2.5 million in the second quarter ending Nov. 30, 2004.\nThe reduction includes employees who work in operations, marketing,\nsales, research and development, support and services. All\nterminations and related payments are expected to be completed during\nfiscal 2005. The company is continuing to evaluate other cost\nreduction opportunities that may result in additional charges in the\nsecond quarter ending Nov. 30, 2004, and during the remainder of\nfiscal 2005. Because management has not completed its evaluation and\nplan, the nature, amount and timing of any additional charges are not\ncurrently determinable.\n    "Despite our disappointment in the level of license fees in our\nfirst quarter, we are pleased that we were able to minimize the impact\non our earnings per share," said Jay Coughlan, Lawson president and\nchief executive officer. "There is a strong opportunity for Lawson as\na key enterprise application software provider in today\'s environment.\nWe remain committed to our vertical strategy and will focus on the\ncontinued verticalization of our products to deliver greater value to\nour clients. We also continue to make the appropriate investments in\nour growth, even as we improve our efficiencies by managing our costs\nand expenses."\n\n    Conference Call and Webcast\n\n    Lawson will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter\nresults and future outlook at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (3:30 p.m.\nCentral Time) Sept. 30, 2004.\n    Interested parties may listen to the call by dialing 888-603-9617\n(passcode Lawson 930) and international callers 1-517-308-9002.

These non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses and\nnon-cash charges such as software and intangible amortization related\nto acquisitions and acquired maintenance contracts, non-cash\nstock-based compensation and restructuring. Lawson believes that this\npresentation facilitates comparison by investors, analysts, and others\nof our operating results with other companies in our peer group as\nwell as to Lawson\'s historical results. Management uses non-GAAP\noperating results to evaluate short-term and long-term operating\ntrends in Lawson\'s core software operations. Non-GAAP operating\nresults are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be\nconsidered a substitute for or an alternative to operating results\ndetermined in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by\nother companies.
