Despite flat net sales in the second\nquarter, the Corporation exceeded its prior year earnings per share results\ndue primarily to increased licensing income, reduced supply chain costs and\nlower interest expense.  The Corporation\'s Board of Directors authorized the\ninitiation of a quarterly cash dividend of 6 cents per share.\n\n    Second Quarter\n    As a result of the letter of agreement announced on July 30th to sell the\nMagnivision subsidiary, the Corporation has classified its Magnivision\nsubsidiary as a discontinued operation.   The Corporation has provided\nfinancial results on continuing operations as well as net results of\ndiscontinued operations (the assets held for sale). The Corporation reported\nnet income from continuing operations of $5.9 million, or 9 cents per share,\non net sales of $391.9 million, for the fiscal 2005 second quarter ended\nAugust 31, 2004 (all per-share amounts assume dilution). This compares to a\nreported net loss from continuing operations of $10.6 million, or 16 cents per\nshare, on net sales of $390.9 million, for the year earlier period.\nDiscontinued operations contributed approximately $1 million of net income or\n1 cent per share to both the second quarter of fiscal 2005 as well as the\nsecond quarter of fiscal 2004.\n    Net sales were flat compared to the prior period as incremental revenue\nfrom acquisitions in the AG Interactive segment and favorable foreign exchange\nmovements were offset by lower revenues in both the retail segment and the\nfixtures business.  Pretax income increased $27.2 million from a loss of\n$17.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 to $9.6 million of income\nin the second quarter of fiscal 2005.\n\n    Management Comments\n    Zev Weiss, Chief Executive Officer said, "In the second quarter, we were\nable to generate much improved performance over last year for both earnings\nand cash flow.  The earnings improvement was due primarily to increased income\nfrom licensing, reduced implementation costs related to our ongoing supply\nchain transformation and lower interest expense because of our prepayment of\ndebt.  We were also very pleased by our cash flow results which were driven by\nincreased earnings and a continued focus on improving our balance sheet."\n\n    Third Quarter and Full Year Estimates\n    "For the third fiscal quarter, we are projecting our earnings per share to\nbe between 67 cents and 72 cents," Weiss said. Last year, the Corporation\nreported earnings per share of 60 cents for the third quarter.\n    "Our initial fiscal year 2005 earnings estimate of $1.63 to $1.68 per\nshare was adjusted last quarter to earnings of $1.46 to $1.51 per share to\ntake into account the costs and benefits from our tender offer," Weiss\ncontinued. "We are not changing the adjusted EPS estimate. However, because\nour cash flow was so strong in our first half, we are raising the estimate for\nfiscal 2005 cash flow from operating and investing activities by 25% from\n$200 million to $250 million."\n\n    Dividend Initiated\n    The Corporation\'s Board of Directors has authorized the initiation of a\nquarterly cash dividend of 6 cents per share for shareholders of record at the\nclose of business on October 19, 2004, payable on October 29, 2004. Weiss\nsaid, "We previously stated that we would announce our plans on ways to\nenhance shareholder value in the second fiscal half.  Now, we have taken the\nfirst step in returning capital to shareholders by initiating a dividend."\n\n    Conference call on the Web\n    American Greetings will broadcast its conference call live on the Internet\nat 9:30 a.m. Eastern time today.
