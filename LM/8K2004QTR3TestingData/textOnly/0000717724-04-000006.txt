REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-END FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\nSUFFERN,  NY - SEPTEMBER 22, 2004 - The Dress Barn, Inc. (NASDAQ - DBRN), one of\nthe nation\'s  leading women\'s  specialty  retailers  offering quality career and\ncasual fashion  apparel at value prices,  today reported  earnings and sales for\nits fiscal fourth quarter and year ended July 31, 2004.\n\nNet  earnings  for the fiscal  fourth  quarter  ended  July 31,  2004 were $13.5\nmillion or $0.44 per share. This compares to a net loss of $8.0 million or $0.27\nloss per share last year.  Last  year\'s  fourth  quarter  loss  resulted  from a\npre-tax litigation charge of $32 million that impacted earnings.  Fourth quarter\nearnings,  excluding the effect of this charge, would have been $12.5 million or\n$0.42 per share.  The Company  continues  to strongly  believe  that there is no\nmerit  for the jury  award and has  appealed  it.  This  year\'s  fourth  quarter\nearnings were favorably  impacted by the extra reporting week as a result of the\nCompany\'s fiscal year ended July 31, 2004, which included a fifty-third week.\n\nAs  previously  reported,  net sales for the thirteen week period ended July 24,\n2004  increased  4% to $196.3  million  compared to $188.1  million for the same\ncomparable period last year.  Same-store sales increased 1%. Total sales for the\nfourteen week period ended July 31, 2004 were $208.0 million.\n\nNet earnings for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004 were $30.1 million or $1.00\nper share. This compares to $8.0 million or $0.25 per share last year, which was\nimpacted by the litigation charge. Excluding the effect of this charge, earnings\nwould have been $28.5 million or $0.89 per share.\n\nNet sales for the  fifty-two  week period  ended July 24, 2004  increased  5% to\n$743.2 million  compared to $707.1 million for the same  comparable  period last\nyear.  Same-store  sales  increased  2% for this  period.  Total  sales  for the\nfifty-three week period ended July 31, 2004 were $754.9 million.\n\nElliot S. Jaffe, Chairman of the Board, commented: "Our fourth quarter reflected\nmixed sales  results.  Like much of the  industry,  we  experienced  weak demand\ntowards the back half of the quarter.  We believe this  slowdown was caused by a\nnumber of external  factors  including high energy  prices,  weather and ongoing\ngeopolitical uncertainties. These factors could further impact consumer spending\ngoing  forward.  Nevertheless,  we were  generally  pleased  with  the  level of\nearnings achieved, which was primarily driven by improved gross profit."\n\n"We  continue to operate our  business  cautiously,  maintaining  our  inventory\ndiscipline,  while keeping our assortments fresh. Overall,  inventory levels are\ncurrent and in good shape heading into the new fall season."\n\n', u'\n\nAs of July 31, 2004,  the Company  operated 776 stores (178 Dress Barn, 53 Dress\nBarn Woman and 545 Combination Stores) in 45 states.\n\nAs previously announced,  the Company will host a conference call this afternoon\nat 3:00 p.m.  Eastern Time to review its fourth  quarter and year-end  financial\nresults.\n\nThe  conference  call will be webcast by CCBN and can be  accessed  at The Dress\nBarn,  Inc.\'s  web  site at  www.dressbarn.com.
