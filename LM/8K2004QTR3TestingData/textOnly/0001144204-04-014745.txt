(TED) LAWSON,\nPRESIDENT & CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF 21ST CENTURY HOLDING COMPANY (NASDAQ:\nTCHC), comments about Federated National Insurance Company, a subsidiary of 21st\nCentury, "First and foremost we would like to assure all of our policyholders\nthat were effected by Hurricane Frances that our adjusters are in the stricken\narea and working hard to help take care of them. Our claim lines are open 24\nhours a day, 7 days a week. Our offices are staffed and we are responding to our\npolicyholders needs."\n\n         Mr. Lawson continued, "Even though we\'ve had damage from Hurricane\nIvan, because of our limited exposure in the panhandle our modeling now suggests\nit will be manageable. At this time we are not changing our 2004 earnings per\nshare guidance of $0.50 to $1.50 per share or our 2005 guidance of approximately\n$4.00 per share. Now after 3 major hurricanes, one of them, Frances, so large it\naffected the entire state, and the other two, catastrophic category 4 storms,\nwe\'re still going to be strong and profitable. Even though the results are\ntentative at this time, I personally think that\'s pretty impressive. Again, this\nyear\'s story is about hurricanes, but next year will be about growth and\nprofitability.
