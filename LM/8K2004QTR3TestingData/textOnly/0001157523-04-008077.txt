Reports Fiscal 2005 First Quarter Operating Results\n\n    MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 24, 2004--Benihana Inc. ("the\nCompany") (NASDAQ:BNHNA and BNHN), operator of one of the nation\'s\nlargest chains of Asian restaurants, today reported operating results\nfor the first fiscal quarter (four periods) ended July 18, 2004.\n    Total revenues for the first fiscal quarter amounted to $65.4\nmillion, compared with $61.1 million, in the corresponding year ago\nperiod, an increase of 7.0%. Net income totaled $1.9 million, or $0.20\nper fully diluted share, based on approximately 9.8 million average\ndiluted shares outstanding, compared with $3.0 million, or $0.33 per\nfully diluted share, based on 9.0 million average diluted shares\noutstanding, in the corresponding year-ago period. Net income in the\nfiscal 2005 first quarter was affected by higher food costs and\nexpenses for architectural services related to future construction and\nrenovations. The quarter\'s earnings were also unfavorably affected by\nincreases in workers\' compensation expenses, particularly in\nCalifornia, and by certain non-recurring items.\n    Fiscal first quarter restaurant sales increased to $64.9 million,\ncompared with $60.5 million. Approximately $4.1 million of the\nincrease was derived from new restaurants and $1.6 million from\nincreases in comparable sales. As reported previously, total\ncomparable sales for all concepts in the fiscal first quarter\nincreased 2.7%, including gains of 1.7% at the teppanyaki restaurants,\n5.8% at Haru and 9.9% at RA Sushi.\n    Guest counts continued to rise to 2.6 million from 2.5 million a\nyear ago. Average guest checks company-wide amounted to $23.41 per\nperson. To offset higher food and other costs at the Benihana\nteppanyaki restaurants, prices were increased in mid-July by an\naverage 2-3%, and indications thus far are that traffic growth has not\nslowed as a result.\n    Fiscal first quarter restaurant gross profits amounted to $47.7\nmillion, compared with $45.0 million a year ago. Gross profit margin\nequaled 73.4%, against 74.3% in the corresponding period last year,\nwith restaurant operating profits amounting to $9.4 million, compared\nwith $9.5 million. The decrease in gross profit margin was largely a\nresult of increased beef prices. Beef represents approximately 40% of\nteppanyaki food costs.\n    A charge of $550,000 was made to expense the costs for\narchitectural services in connection with the previously announced\nplanning and design program for the construction and renovation of the\nteppanyaki restaurant chain. The design program was initiated to\nproduce an exciting, fresh look for existing restaurants, and provide\na template for efficient use of space, lower operating costs and\nconstruction cost savings. The design program is virtually complete\nand future expenses associated with the design program are not\nexpected to be material.\n    Other significant charges made during the quarter including the\nwrite-off of certain property in connection with a renovation and\naccelerating depreciation and amortization for two other restaurants\nfor which lease renewal options are unlikely to be made. The Company\nalso incurred legal costs associated with litigation brought about by\nthe trust that owns a substantial portion of the Company\'s Common\nStock (the "Aoki suit"). The Company expects that future costs of the\nlitigation will be significant but cannot yet estimate the total\namount. The litigation seeks to reverse a transaction that provides\nfor up to $20 million in cash necessary to achieve the Company\'s\ngrowth objectives and restaurant renovation program.\n    Benihana has begun a trial program in Florida with a national\nrestaurant supply firm to more effectively deal with fluctuating\ncommodity and other expenses. The purchasing program is expected to be\nin place by the beginning of the fourth quarter. Additionally, an\nagreement on a national supply contract recently entered into with\nPepsi for soft drink beverages is similarly expected to benefit food\nand beverage costs.\n    "Our Company has moved aggressively to deal with the issues that\nimpacted the first quarter, while also moving forward to continue to\ngrow Benihana," said Joel A. Schwartz, President and CEO. "We have put\nin place a preferred financing that will enable us to assure the\nnecessary capital for our expansion and remodeling program. The\nconcepts, Haru and RA Sushi, that we have acquired in recent years,\nand the highly renowned Benihana teppanyaki chain, all hold\nsignificant promise, and we remain enthused, excited and confident\nabout Benihana\'s outlook and its ability to continue to enhance\nshareholder value."\n\n    Fiscal 2005 Second Quarter Outlook\n\n    Comparable sales in the first four-weeks of the second quarter\nwere strong with comparable sales gains of 7.4 %. The recent menu\nprice increase is expected to benefit margins at the Teppanyaki\nrestaurants and, thus far, the increase has not negatively affected\ntraffic. The Aoki suit litigation costs are likely to be significant\nin the second quarter and could extend through the remainder of the\nyear. Allowing for estimated litigation costs, earnings per diluted\nshare for the second quarter are estimated to be from $0.13 to $0.15\nper share.\n\n    About Benihana\n\n    Benihana, now in its 40th year and one of the nation\'s largest\nchains of Asian restaurants, currently operates 70 restaurants\nnationwide, including 57 Benihana teppanyaki restaurants, five Haru\nsushi restaurants, seven RA Sushi Bar Restaurants and one Doraku\nrestaurant. Under development at present are five restaurants - one\nBenihana, two Haru and two RA Sushi. In addition, a total of 23\nfranchised Benihana teppanyaki restaurants are now open or under\ndevelopment in the U.S. and Latin America.\n\n    Statements in this press release concerning the Company\'s business\noutlook or future economic performance, anticipated profitability,\nrevenues, expenses or other financial items, together with other\nstatements that are not historical facts, are "forward-looking\nstatements" as that term is defined under Federal Securities Laws.\n"Forward-looking statements" are subject to risks, uncertainties and\nother factors which could cause actual results to differ materially\nfrom those stated in such statements.
