The increase in revenues was primarily the result of increased\ninfrastructure sales activity in the Government marketplace.\n\nNet income for the Company's fiscal 2004 fourth quarter was $0.4 million, or\n$0.03 per diluted share. This compares to a net loss of $5.5 million, or $0.44\nper diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The turnaround in the\nCompany's net loss to a net profit was primarily driven by an increase in\nrevenues and an improvement in the overall gross margin of the Company, coupled\nwith benefits achieved by the Company's cost cutting initiatives. The net loss\nfor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 included non-recurring charges of $4.5\nmillion relating to contracts with a major customer, offset by a $1.0 million\nnon-recurring cash recovery in connection with the previously announced\ntermination of services by a major customer in the Middle East.\n\n\nFISCAL 2004 TWELVE-MONTH RESULTS\n- --------------------------------\n\nRevenues for the Company's fiscal year 2004 ended June 30, 2004 increased 61.5%\nto $87.2 million, compared to $54.0 million in fiscal year 2003. The increase in\nrevenues was primarily the result of increased infrastructure sales in the\nGovernment marketplace, coupled with a general overall improvement in the\ntelecommunications industry segments that the Company serves.\n\nNet loss for the Company's fiscal year 2004 decreased 93.2% to $1.3 million, or\n$0.10 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $19.6 million, or $1.56 per\ndiluted share, in fiscal year 2003. The decrease in the net loss was primarily\nattributed to an increase in revenues and an improvement in the overall gross\nmargin of the Company. The net loss was further reduced by a reduction of\nsatellite bandwidth costs\n\n", u'\n\nbased on agreements reached with certain Company vendors and benefits achieved\nby the Company\'s cost cutting initiatives. The net loss for fiscal 2003 included\nnon-recurring charges of $4.5 million relating to contracts with a major\ncustomer.\n\n\nMANAGEMENT\'S REVIEW OF RESULTS\n- ------------------------------\n\nCommenting on the fourth quarter and twelve-month financial results, David\nHershberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Globecomm said, "Fiscal 2004\nwas a turnaround year for Globecomm as we increased revenues by 62%, decreased\nour net loss by 93% and capped off the year with profitability in the fourth\nquarter. I am proud of the management team and employees who endured difficult\nyears as we restructured the Company in an effort to return to growth and\nprofitability. Our vision throughout that period had been to invest in the\nCompany and emerge with better products, enhanced capabilities and new service\nofferings. The ability to integrate multiple technologies required in modern\nlarge-scale complex communication networks positions Globecomm to win contracts\nfor these types of opportunities as evidenced by two recently announced\ncontracts to reconstruct communications in Afghanistan totaling $28.9 million."\n\nMr. Hershberg continued, "The Company is now well positioned in the Government\nmarketplace where we see new requirements for our products and services. We\nexpect this will lead Globecomm to increased revenues and profitability for the\nfiscal year ending June 30, 2005. I look forward to discussing our progress on\nthis front over the next few quarters."\n\n\nMANAGEMENT\'S CURRENT EXPECTATIONS FOR THE FULL YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 2005\n- ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGlobecomm expects consolidated revenues for the full year ending June 30, 2005\nto be in excess of $105 million. The Company anticipates achieving full year\nprofitability at this revenue level, excluding a non-recurring gain of $1.9\nmillion pursuant to a previously announced settlement agreement with a major\ncustomer, which will be reflected in the Company\'s fiscal first quarter ending\nSeptember 30, 2004. The Company further anticipates quarterly income statement\nfluctuations resulting from the nature of the business and the size of certain\ncontracts in backlog.\n\nThese expectations reflect management\'s current view of the next twelve months.\nActual results for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2005 will remain susceptible\nto factors beyond our control in certain areas of the world. This may include,\nbut is not limited to, major disruptions in the marketplaces we operate due to\npolitical unrest, local violence, global economic recession and changes in\nUnited States Government foreign policy. Results will also remain susceptible to\npossible cost overruns on projects.\n\nThe Company ended fiscal year 2004 with $28.3 million in cash and cash\nequivalents, which is an increase of approximately $6.2 million from fiscal year\n2003, primarily resulting from the $6.2 million in net proceeds received from\nconsummation of a private placement of the Company\'s securities during fiscal\n2004. During fiscal 2005, Globecomm currently anticipates a significant\nquarter-to-quarter fluctuation in cash and cash equivalents based on working\ncapital requirements to support the projected revenue growth.\n\n\nGlobecomm Systems Inc. is an end-to-end satellite-based communications solutions\nprovider.
