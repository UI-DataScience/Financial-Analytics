Sales for the year jumped 22 percent to a new company high of $20.6\nmillion, compared to $16.9 million in fiscal 2003. Net income for the year ended\nJune 30, 2004 also reached an all-time record of $970,272 ($.11 per share),\ncompared to $24,799 ($.00 per share) in fiscal 2003.\n\n         Sales for the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2004, increased 29 percent\nto $5.0 million, compared to $3.9 million for the same period in 2003. Net\nincome for the quarter rose to $245,213 ($.03 per share), compared to a net\nfourth quarter loss in 2003 of $156,226 ($.02 per share).\n\n         "Fiscal 2004 was a banner year for Dynatronics," stated Kelvyn H.\nCullimore Jr., company president. "The strong results reflect the popularity of\nour new Solaris products that use advanced technology light therapy to relieve\npain."\n\n         In June 2004, Dynatronics introduced a fifth unit to the Solaris family\n- - the Solaris 701 - which combines ultrasound therapy with light therapy in a\nsingle device. The company now provides one of the most complete lines of light\ntherapy products in the United States.\n\n         "Light therapy is a proven winner," remarked Larry K. Beardall,\nDynatronics\' executive vice president of marketing and sales. "With hundreds of\nclinical research studies supporting its efficacy, light therapy is becoming an\nimportant tool for medical practitioners. Thousands of people around the country\nare already benefiting from this technology."\n\n         Another important development was the June 2004 FDA clearance of\nDynatronics\' newest light probe: the Dynatron 890. This probe, which began\nshipping to customers last week, uses a laser diode that produces greater output\nthan the superluminous diodes in the current Dynatron 880.\n\n         The success of this fiscal year is attributable to strategic research\nand development initiatives begun over two years ago. Those initiatives continue\nto be a cornerstone of Dynatronics\' growth strategy, with several new products,\nincluding additional light probes, slated for development and introduction in\nfiscal 2005. These new product introductions are expected to spur organic growth\nand help the company maintain its position as an innovative leader in the\nindustry.\n\n         "With the success of this past year, we plan to continue our strategic\nresearch and development focus in order to bring new products to the market in\ncoming years. It is this cycle of new product introductions that will provide\nboth top and bottom line growth in the future," added Cullimore.\n\n         Dynatronics has scheduled a conference call for investors today at 1\np.m. EDT (11 a.m. MDT).
