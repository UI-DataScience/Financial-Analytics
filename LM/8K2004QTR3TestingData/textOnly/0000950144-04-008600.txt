These two hotels were subsequently sold in the third\nquarter of this year. The effects of these sixteen hotels are reflected in\ndiscontinued operations.\n\n         Total operating revenues for the 28 weeks ended July 11, 2004 were\n$20.7 million compared with $14.5 million in the same period of 2003.

"We now have more hotels operating\nunder one nationally-recognized name that cater to both business and leisure\ntravelers."\n\n         During the second quarter of 2004, the Company converted its 31st\nShoney\'s Inn to the GuestHouse brand. Three former independent hotels were also\nconverted to the GuestHouse brand in the most recent quarter. The conversions\nbrought the total number of GuestHouse locations nationally to 72.\n\n         Moore said that ShoLodge also continued to increase the number of\nhotels and resort properties served by InnLink, the Company\'s proprietary\nreservation center. As of the end of the second quarter of 2004, InnLink served\na total of 961 lodging facilities as compared with 819 lodging facilities a year\nearlier. Moore added that in addition to the Company\'s increased franchising\nefforts and continued expansion of our reservation services, it intends to\ncontinue to utilize its construction and development expertise as opportunities\narise.\n\n         This press release contains forward-looking statements relating to\ncertain matters, which reflect management\'s best judgment, based on factors\ncurrently known and involve risks and uncertainties.
