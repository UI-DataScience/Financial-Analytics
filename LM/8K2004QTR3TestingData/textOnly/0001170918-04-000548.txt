Gross profit for the second  quarter ended June 30,\n2004 was  $163,469,  compared with gross profit of $22,447 for the first quarter\nended March 31, 2004, an increase of over 700%.\n\nThe increase was  attributable  to the  introduction of a series of new products\nand the Company\'s  expanded  sales and marketing  efforts in China.  On June 29,\n2004 the Company  announced  the addition of 17 new  customers  and a government\npartnership in Shandong Province.\n\n"We are very pleased with the efforts of our sales and marketing staff in China.\nWe continue to see increased  commitments from customers who are re-ordering the\nproduct in greater  quantities,"  commented Wei Li, Chairman and CEO of KIWA. Li\nadded, "Our net sales increased  substantially over the previous quarter, and we\nincreased  our  gross  profit   significantly  on  a  percentage  basis,   which\ndemonstrates our efforts to manage our growth."\n\nNet loss  decreased  $893,291 to $756,955 for the second  quarter ended June 30,\n2004, as compared to $1,650,246  for the first quarter ended March 31, 2004, but\nincreased  $681,671  from $75,284 for the three months ended June 30, 2003.  The\ndecrease from the first quarter is attributable to  significantly  lower reverse\nmerger related expenses in the second quarter. The increase from the same period\nof last year is  primarily  the result of  charges  related  to  consulting  and\nprofessional  fees,  convertible  notes,  and start of  operations in the United\nStates in April 2004. Included in the net loss for the second quarter ended June\n30, 2004 are  approximately  $323,000 of non-cash charges related to convertible\nloans and professional services.\n\nLi further stated,  "We have invested heavily in the launch of our United States\noperations,  an important  component to our future growth,  and have formed some\nimportant US based  strategic  relationships  that will allow us to enter the US\nmarket  more  quickly.  Our US  operation  will give us the right to market  and\ndistribute products manufactured by US companies into the Chinese market. We are\nconfident  that  KIWA  will  meet  its  objectives  and  continue  to grow  both\norganically and through partnerships and acquisitions."\n\n\n', u'\n', u'\n            Kiwa Bio-Tech Products Group Corporation and Subsidiaries\n                          (A Development Stage Company)\n           Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (Unaudited)\n\n\n', u'\n                                                                                                       June 5, 2002\n                                     Three Months Ended June 30,        Six Months Ended June 30,     (Inception) to\n                                   ------------------------------     ----------------------------     June 30, 2004\n                                       2004             2003              2004            2003         (Cumulative)\n                                   ------------      ------------     ------------    ------------     ------------\n', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u"\nNet sales ......................   $    239,759      $       --      $    293,217     $       --       $    333,248\nCost of sales ..................         76,290              --           107,301             --            137,595\n                                   ------------      ------------    ------------     ------------     ------------\nGross profit ...................        163,469              --           185,916             --            195,653\n                                   ------------      ------------    ------------     ------------     ------------\n\nOperating expenses:\n  Consulting and professional\n    fees .......................         69,573              --            99,460             --            667,063\n  Directors' compensation ......         11,599            13,931          20,298           17,555          368,314\n  General and administrative ...        201,444            42,705         275,988           86,422          644,924\n  Research and development .....         14,210            17,184          26,751           26,904           96,350\n  Depreciation and amortization.          8,397             1,761          17,535            3,661           36,425\n  Reverse merger costs .........         19,453              --         1,417,434             --          1,467,770\n                                   ------------      ------------    ------------     ------------     ------------\n  Total costs and expenses .....        324,676            75,581       1,857,466          134,542        3,280,846\n                                   ------------      ------------    ------------     ------------     ------------\n                                       (161,207)          (75,581)     (1,671,550)        (134,542)      (3,085,193)\n                                   ------------      ------------    ------------     ------------     ------------\n\nInterest income (expense), net..
