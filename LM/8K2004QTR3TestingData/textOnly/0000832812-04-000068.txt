The increase was due to\nhigher tuition rates, offset by reduced occupancy, as well as additional net\nrevenues generated by the newly opened centers. Comparable center net revenues\nincreased $4.6 million, or 2.3%. ', u'\n', u'The average weekly tuition\nrate grew $8.18 or 5.6%, from the same period last year to $154.51, due\nprimarily to tuition increases. Occupancy declined 1.8 percentage points to\n64.1% due primarily to reduced full-time equivalent attendance within the\npopulation of older centers. ', u'\n', u'During the fourth quarter\nof fiscal 2004, operating income was $21.6 million, a decrease of $1.5 million,\nor 6.4%, from the same period last year. The decrease in operating income was\ndue primarily to overall higher expense for salaries, wages and benefits and\nincreased asset impairment charges included in depreciation expense, offset by\ncost controls. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues in the fourth\nquarters of fiscal 2004 and 2003 was 10.3% and 11.4%, respectively. ', u'\n', u'Net income was $8.3 million\nduring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to $3.4 million in the same\nperiod last year, an increase of 147.3%. The most significant reason for the\nincrease was the absence in fiscal 2004 of a $4.0 million, after taxes,\nwrite-down of a minority investment ($6.7 million before taxes), which was\nrecorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. For the fourth quarter of fiscal\n2004 basic and diluted net income per share were both $0.42. Basic and diluted\nnet income per share were both $0.17 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. ', u'\n', u'EBITDAR increased $10.0\nmillion, or 23.5%, to $52.7 million, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004,\nfrom the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to higher tuition\nrates and the absence of a write-down of a minority investment. As a percentage\nof net revenues, EBITDAR was 25.1% and 21.1% for the fourth quarters of fiscal\n2004 and 2003, respectively. ', u'\n', u'Our cash balance was $58.9\nmillion at May 28, 2004, an increase of $24.3 million from the third quarter of\nfiscal 2004. The increase was due to increased cash flow from sale-leaseback\nproceeds and operating activities. Our total debt was $488.8 million at May 28,\n2004, a decrease of $28.3 million from the third quarter of fiscal 2004. The\ndecrease was primarily the result of redemption of $15.0 million of aggregate\nprincipal amount of our 9.5% senior subordinated notes and an $11.0 million\nreduction in borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Capital\nexpenditures were $16.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, an\nincrease of $2.7 million from the same period last year. ', u'\n', u'During both of the fourth\nquarters of fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, four centers were opened. We closed\nnine centers during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to four centers\nin the same period last year. ', u'\n', u'Fiscal Year 2004', u'\n', u'Net revenues for fiscal\n2004, were $855.9 million, an increase of $21.3 million, or 2.5%, over the same\nperiod last year. The increase was due to higher tuition rates, offset by\nreduced occupancy, as well as additional net revenues generated by the newly\nopened centers. Comparable center net revenues increased $4.2 million, or 0.5%. ', u'\n', u'The average weekly tuition\nrate grew $8.19, or 5.7%, from the same period last year to $152.64 due\nprimarily to tuition increases. Occupancy declined 2.9 percentage points to\n60.4% due primarily to reduced full-time equivalent attendance within the\npopulation of older centers. ', u'\n', u'During fiscal 2004,\noperating income was $72.0 million, a decrease of $0.9 million or 1.2%. The\ndecrease was due primarily to increased rent expense largely as a result of the\nsale-leaseback program, offset by cost controls. As a percentage of net\nrevenues, operating income was 8.4% and 8.7% in fiscal 2004 and 2003,\nrespectively. ', u'\n', u'Net income was $14.7\nmillion in fiscal 2004, an increase of $1.3 million, or 9.6%, from the same\nperiod last year. Net income as a percentage of net revenues was 1.7% and 1.6%\nin fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. The slight improvement in margin was due\nprimarily to control over costs. Basic and diluted net income per share were\n$0.75 and $0.74, respectively, in fiscal 2004. For fiscal 2003, basic and\ndiluted net income per share were $0.68 and $0.67, respectively. ', u'\n', u'EBITDAR was $189.9 million\nin the fiscal 2004, an increase of $13.1 million over the same period last year.\nAs a percentage of net revenues, EBITDAR was 22.2% in fiscal 2004 compared to\n21.2% in fiscal 2003. The increase was due primarily to higher tuition rates,\ncontrol over costs and the absence in fiscal year 2004 of a charge for the\nwrite-down of a minority investment, which was recorded in fiscal 2003. EBITDAR\nrepresents earnings before interest expense, investment income, income taxes,\ndepreciation, amortization, rent and related components of discontinued\noperations. ', u'\n', u'Our total debt was $488.8 million at May 28, 2004, an increase of $33.7\nmillion from May 30, 2003, while our cash balance increased $40.8 million to\n$58.9 million over the same period due primarily to net proceeds received from\nour sale-leaseback program and cash provided by operating activities. The\nincrease in our debt was largely the result of our debt refinancing in July\n2003, which included financing the acquisition of the centers included in our\nformer $97.9 million synthetic lease facility, offset by the repurchase and\nredemption of $110.6 million aggregate principal amount of our 9.5% senior\nsubordinated notes. Capital expenditures were $58.4 million in fiscal 2004, a\ndecrease of $24.7 million from the same period last year, which was primarily\ndue to a reduction in spending for new center development.\n', u'\n', u'During fiscal 2004, 16 new\ncenters were opened compared to 28 in the same period last year. In addition, we\ncompleted the acquisition of one center in fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2004, 41\ncenters were closed compared to 28 in the same period last year. ', u'\n', u'Non-GAAP Financial Measures', u'\n', u'A non-GAAP financial\nmeasure is a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance,\nfinancial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts, or is\nsubject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding or including amounts,\nfrom the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles (\x93GAAP\x94). At the end of\nthis release, we have provided a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDAR, non-GAAP\nmeasures of our liquidity, to cash provided by operating activities, the most\ncomparable GAAP financial measure. ', u'\n', u'We believe EBITDA and\nEBITDAR are useful tools for certain investors and creditors for measuring our\nability to meet debt service requirements. Additionally, management uses EBITDA\nand EBITDAR for purposes of reviewing our results of operations on a more\ncomparable basis. EBITDA and EBITDAR do not represent cash flow from operations\nas defined by GAAP, are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all\ncash flow needs and should not be considered alternatives to net income under\nGAAP for purposes of evaluating our results of operations. ', u'\n', u'Comparable Centers', u'\n', u'A center is included in\ncomparable center net revenues when it has been open and operated by us at least\none year and it has not been rebuilt or permanently relocated within that year.\nTherefore, a center is considered comparable during the first four-week period\nit has prior year net revenues. Non-comparable centers include those that have\nbeen closed. ', u'\n', u'Discontinued Operations', u'\n', u'Discontinued operations\nrepresents the operating results for all periods presented of the 69 centers\nclosed since fiscal 2002. ', u'\n', u'Fiscal Calendar', u'\n', u'Our fiscal year ends on the\nFriday closest to May 31. The first fiscal quarter is comprised of 16 weeks,\nwhile the second, third and fourth quarters are each comprised of 12 weeks. ', u'\n', u'Conference Call', u'\n', u'We will host a conference\ncall on Tuesday, August 24, 2004 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, at 1.888.417.7531\n(reference: KinderCare) to discuss our fiscal 2004 results.
