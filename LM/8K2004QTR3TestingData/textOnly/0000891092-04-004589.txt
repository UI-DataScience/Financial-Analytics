Net income for the quarter ended August 31,\n2004, was $11.6 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared to net income of\n$3.4 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the August 2003 quarter.\n    "We are off to an excellent start both financially and operationally in\nfiscal 2005, marked by continued improvements in profitability and strong\nrevenue growth," said Chairman and CEO, Donald Murray.  "In particular, the\nstrength of our internal audit and finance and accounting practices continues\nto grow as we assist clients working to implement long-term, cost-effective\ncompliance solutions in response to the ongoing demands of Sarbanes-Oxley.\nImportantly, our compliance work has served as an entree into providing\nadditional specialized project services across each of our service lines.\nThis ability to remain flexible in response to the changing market needs and\nthose of our growing client base has been an important contributor to our\nsuccess, and we look forward to continuing this momentum throughout the rest\nof the year."\n    "Our operating income as a percentage of revenue was greater than we\nplanned as demand grew faster than our internal hiring," Mr. Murray continued.\n"We expect to fill several open positions that may reduce our operating income\npercentage to our planned level."\n\n    ABOUT RESOURCES CONNECTION\n    Resources Connection, Inc. is an international professional services firm\nthat provides accounting and finance, human capital, information management,\nsupply chain management and internal audit/risk management services on a\nproject basis.
