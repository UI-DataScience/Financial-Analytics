Peak, Contango\'s chairman and chief executive officer,\nsaid, "I am pleased with our financial results for fiscal year 2004,\nespecially our EBITDAX of $29.0 million on revenues of $27.6 million.\nOur Freeport LNG project achieved several important milestones,\nincluding FERC approval and our plant\'s 1.5 Bcf per day of send-out\ncapacity is now fully subscribed. Ground-breaking and construction are\nexpected to begin before year end. We also continue to make\nsignificant progress in our offshore exploration program. Our\npartially owned subsidiaries were the high bidders on 24 blocks in the\nMarch 2004 Central Gulf of Mexico lease sale. We now have five\nprospects farmed-out, and our EI113-B prospect is drilling.\n    "Our fiscal year 2004 onshore exploration program was a\ndisappointment. Although we participated in the drilling of 14\nexploratory wells, eight of which were successful, we only found 1.7\nBcfe, far short of replacing our 5.0 Bcfe of fiscal year 2004\nproduction. We expect to participate in 5 to 7 onshore exploration\nwells over the next 6 to 9 months. Financially, our bank line has just\nbeen renewed at $21 million, and we have $1.0 million of debt\ncurrently outstanding. Production is running at 15 MMbtue per day,\nwith monthly EBITDAX of $1.5 to $2.0 million projected through\nDecember 2004."\n    Contango is a Houston-based, independent natural gas and oil\ncompany.

EBITDAX represents earnings before interest, income taxes,\n    depreciation, depletion and amortization, impairment expenses,\n    exploration expenses, including gain (loss) from hedging\n    activities, and sale of assets and other. We have reported EBITDAX\n    because we believe EBITDAX is a measure commonly reported and\n    widely used by investors as an indicator of a company\'s operating\n    performance and ability to incur and service debt. We believe\n    EBITDAX assists investors in comparing a company\'s performance on\n    a consistent basis without regard to depreciation, depletion and\n    amortization, impairment of natural gas and oil properties and\n    exploration expenses, which can vary significantly depending upon\n    accounting methods. EBITDAX is not a calculation based on U.S.\n    generally accepted accounting principles and should not be\n    considered an alternative to net income (loss) in measuring our\n    performance or used as an exclusive measure of cash flow because\n    it does not consider the impact of working capital growth, capital\n    expenditures, debt principal reductions and other sources and uses\n    of cash, which are disclosed in our statements of cash flows.\n    Investors should carefully consider the specific items included in\n    our computation of EBITDAX. While we have disclosed our EBITDAX to\n    permit a more complete comparative analysis of our operating\n    performance and debt servicing ability relative to other\n    companies, investors should be cautioned that EBITDAX as reported\n    by us may not be comparable in all instances to EBITDAX as\n    reported by other companies. EBITDAX amounts may not be fully\n    available for management\'s discretionary use, due to requirements\n    to conserve funds for capital expenditures, debt service,\n    preferred stock dividends and other commitments.\n\n    A reconciliation of EBITDAX to income (loss) from operations for\n    the periods indicated is presented below.\n\n                                                Year ended June 30,\n                                            --------------------------\n                                              2004     2003     2002\n                                            -------- -------- --------\n                                                      ($000)\nIncome (loss) from operations                $4,199  $(6,481) $10,297\nExploration expenses                          9,873   17,922    2,694\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization      6,989    8,788    8,594\nImpairment of natural gas and oil properties     43      181      527\nGain on sale of marketable securities           710      452        -\nGain on sale of assets and other              7,172       39      374\n                                            -------- -------- --------\n  EBITDAX                                   $28,986  $20,901  $22,486\n                                            ======== ======== ========\n\n\n\n    CONTACT: Contango Oil & Gas Company, Houston\n             Kenneth R.
