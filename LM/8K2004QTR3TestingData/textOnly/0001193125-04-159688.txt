The projected operating losses for the third quarter are preliminary estimates only, and the actual results may differ. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Since the second quarter of this year, the Company\x92s business in the People\x92s Republic of China (PRC) has been negatively impacted by changes in the economic\nenvironment as well as structural changes in the handset industry. The Company expects these changes to continue to negatively impact its financial results during fourth quarter of this year. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The Company further announced that it will not proceed with the previously announced initial\npublic offering (IPO) of its Greater China operations, due to the negative impact of these changes on its revenues and profits. As a result, the Company will record a $2.0 million charge in the third quarter for expenses incurred in connection with\nthe Asia IPO. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'CellStar originally announced its plan to pursue the Asia IPO in\nMarch 2003. During the second and third quarters of 2003, however, the spread of severe acute syndrome (SARS) negatively impacted the business environment and financial markets in Hong Kong and China, resulting, in a delay of the IPO. Based on the\nadvice of the Company\x92s investment bankers, UBS Warburg, the Company decided to proceed with the IPO earlier this year targeting a summer 2004 completion date. Due to delays in the process of listing the stock on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong\nand an unfavorable financial market in Hong Kong, UBS advised the Company to delay the IPO until the fall of 2004. However, towards the end of the second quarter of this year, the noticeable shifts in the economic landscape and handset industry\nprompted the Company\x92s decision not to proceed with the Asia IPO at this time. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OPERATING ENVIRONMENT IN CHINA ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'During the past twelve to\nfourteen months, China\x92s economy has grown at an accelerated rate, causing the Chinese government to take steps to cool down the rapid growth. A recent Chinese news article speculated that the country could experience its first interest rate\nincrease in nine years. During the second quarter of this year, the Chinese government implemented tighter credit controls, impacting consumer sentiment in the market place and resulting in inventory build across most channels. Current excess\ninventory levels are reported to be greater than they were during the outbreak of SARS in 2003, with some estimates as high as 40 million excess handsets. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Also, during this period, one of the Company\x92s largest suppliers in China lowered its handset prices in an effort to boost its declining market share. Several other\nsuppliers responded by also lowering their prices. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In addition to these\neconomic changes, China\x92s handset market has recently undergone certain structural changes. The growth rate of handset sales in major cities is slowing down as penetration rates increase. Therefore, new growth will have to come from smaller\ncities and rural areas surrounding the major cities. In an effort to boost new growth, carriers have begun to subsidize handsets. This is a dramatic shift in the role of the carrier in China as they have not historically subsidized handsets. As the\ncompetition in the handset industry intensifies, many manufacturers have begun to explore shipping large volumes directly to retailers, in particular large scale superstores and provincial distributors. This shift in strategy will move the\nmanufacturers closer to the end user, thereby reducing the layers of distribution and limiting their use of national distributors. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'NEW STRATEGY ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In spite of these recent developments, the Company continues to believe that there is still enormous growth opportunity in China and is currently restructuring its\nbusiness model to reflect the new operating environment in the region. Historically, the operation in China has operated as a national distributor with a distribution channel of approximately 73 local distributors, representing approximately 17,000\npoints of sale. The Company has cooperative agreements with several of these distributors that allow them to establish wholesale and retail operations using CellStar\x92s trademarks. Under the terms of these agreements, CellStar provides services,\nsales support, training and promotional materials in exchange for an agreement to purchase only from CellStar those products sold by CellStar. Given the recent shift in the industry, the Company believes that an investment in the distribution\nchannel in China will allow it to participate in the retail and wholesale activities of several of its largest customers. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The Company is pursuing this strategy primarily to shift a portion of its handset business to the retail sector in order to reduce the layers of distribution and improve\nprofits. Currently CellStar provides approximately 45% of the total product sold by eight of its largest distributors. The new strategy will allow the Company to not only continue to participate in the wholesale sales to these customers, but also\nparticipate in the retail portion of their business, which typically has higher margins. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'As a result of the investment, the Company believes that it can provide its customers with resources and finances that they are currently lacking, as well as the national recognition and backing that the CellStar\nbrand has obtained in China. The Company also believes that the investment will elevate its retail presence in China and allow it to build stronger relationships with the carriers as they are becoming a dominant player in the handset industry. The\ninvestment will also facilitate the Company\x92s growth outside major cities, and as manufacturers in the PRC shift to more direct to retail models, allow the Company to remain key to the new distribution model that is emerging in the country.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x93We have always believed that an ownership position in the distribution\nchannel, especially on the retail front, was a key factor to our continued success in the region,\x94 said executive chairman, Terry Parker. \x93However, this was not possible until China began to relax the prohibition on foreign participation\nin the wholesale and retail sectors this year in accordance with its commitment to participate in the World Trade Organization (\x93WTO\x94).\x94 ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Historically, laws and regulations in China have prohibited foreign companies from operating as a wholesaler or a retailer in the domestic China market. As a result,\nCellStar\x92s trading activities are currently carried out in a bonded zone, which owns the requisite government licenses to conduct trading activities between enterprises located within and outside of that zone. The Company\x92s trading\nactivities in the bonded zone inevitably limits its ability to explore the full market potential of the distribution business in China. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'As a result of China\x92s participation in the WTO, many of the restrictions on wholesale, retail and franchise activities will be lifted by the end of the year,\nallowing the Company to pursue in-country ownership positions. Effective June 1, 2004, foreign investors can set up joint ventures with a majority control interest in the distribution sector including wholesale, retail and import/export. Effective\nDecember 1, 2004, foreign investors can set up wholly owned subsidiaries to operate wholesale, retail and import/export business. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x93We have had a long and very successful relationship with the distribution channel in Asia and the new regulations will allow us to solidify our partnership going\nforward,\x94 said CEO, Robert Kaiser. \x93In order to capitalize on the brand recognition that we have built in China, we are actively pursuing joint ventures with key local distributors in each of the regions and expect to finalize the\nagreements in the near future.\x94 ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The asset based investments will most\nlikely be joint ventures in which the Company will have a majority holding. Each of the key distributors currently has a significant retail presence in China. The investment will be a phased approach over a two year period. Successful completion of\ncertain operating milestones will be required to proceed to the next investment phase to ensure that the strategy is working. The due diligence and approval process on the first phase is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The Company\nplans to have one or two joint ventures in each of the four regions in the PRC by the end of 2005. The transactions are subject to due diligence and approval by the PRC authorities, the Boards of Directors of each participating company and approval\nby the Company\x92s lender. Therefore, there can be no assurance that these investments will take place. However, the Company is committed to the new strategy and plans to move as quickly as possible. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The Company also plans to exit its operations in Singapore and The Philippines. These\noperations have been unprofitable for the last several quarters and were not included in the proposed IPO. As a result of exiting these operations, the Company will record approximately $4.0 million book loss during the third quarter. The Company is\ncurrently exploring potential growth opportunities in the operation in Taiwan and plans to keep it in the Asia portfolio at this time.
