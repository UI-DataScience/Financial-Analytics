(NASDAQ:SGRP)\ntoday reported financial results for the second quarter and six months ended\nJune 30, 2004.\n\n         For the 2004 second quarter, the company sustained a net loss of $12.2\nmillion, equal to $0.65 per share, which includes approximately $9.3 million in\nnon cash expenses ($8.1 million in non-cash impairment charges, and a $1.2\nmillion non-cash charge against net deferred tax assets and tax benefits\nrecorded in the first quarter of 2004). Net revenues for the 2004 second quarter\namounted to $11.9 million. The company reported net income of $608,000, or $0.03\nper diluted share, on net revenues of $17.4 million for the second quarter of\n2003.\n\n         For the first six months of 2004, the company posted a net loss of\n$13.0 million, or $0.69 per share, on revenues of $24.7 million, compared with\nnet income of $1.9 million, equal to $0.10 per fully diluted share, on net\nrevenues of $36.1 million for the corresponding prior year period.\n\n         Robert G. Brown, SPAR Group's chairman and chief executive officer,\nsaid more than 77% of the loss for the second quarter and 68% of the loss for\nthe six month period was attributable to non-cash, non-recurring items.\n\n\n                                     (more)\n", u'\n\n         "While we have lost some key business, resulting in part from our\nlargest customer completing the sale of its business and a major retailer\nclosing some of its stores and changing some of its merchandising policies to\nemerge from bankruptcy, we have taken swift and decisive action in a\nrestructuring plan aimed at restoring SPAR\'s financial health by downsizing our\nfixed expense structure to reflect our lower revenue base and returning the\ncompany to profitability in 2005," Brown said. "We plan to cut fixed costs, but\nnot at the expense of the quality of service we provide to our customers. In\naddition, we plan to continue investing in technology, local in-store\ndemonstration services and international expansion. We believe these areas\nthough currently contributing to our losses, will improve profits in the future.\nIt is our intent to build a profitable company and add tangible shareholder\nvalue. We are taking steps now to help assure that our long-term objectives will\nbe met," Brown said.\n\n         SPAR Group, Inc. is a diversified international marketing services\ncompany, providing a broad array of productivity enhancing products and services\nto help Fortune 1000 companies improve their sales, operating efficiency and\nprofits. The company provides in-store merchandising, in-store demonstrations,\ntechnology and research to manufacturers and retailers covering all product\nclassifications and all classes of trade, including mass market, drug store,\nconvenience store and grocery chains, throughout the United States and\ninternationally.\n\n\n         Certain statements in this news release are forward-looking, including,\nbut not limited to, the benefits to be derived from the company\'s restructuring\nplan and the ability to return to profitability in 2005. The company\'s actual\nresults, performance and trends could differ materially from those indicated or\nimplied by such statements as a result of various factors, including (without\nlimitation) the continued strengthening of SPAR\'s selling and marketing\nfunctions, continued customer satisfaction and contract renewal, new product\ndevelopment, continued technological superiority over its competitors, continued\navailability of capable dedicated personnel, continued cost management, the\nsuccess of its international efforts, success and availability of acquisitions,\navailability of financing and other factors, as well as by factors applicable to\nmost companies such as general economic, competitive and other business and\ncivil conditions.
