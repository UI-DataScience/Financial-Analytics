During these discussions the company sought guidance from the\nSEC staff concerning revenue recognition policies, including a new accounting\npronouncement which became effective for transactions after June 30, 2003.\n\n         Based upon the guidance received from the SEC staff, Warrantech now\nrecognizes\n\n                                 o Page 1 of 8\n", u'\n\nWarrantech Corporation                                             Aug. 24, 2004\nFY 2004 Financial Results\n\n\n                                     -more-\n\nrevenues over the life of the service contracts which it administers. Despite\nWarrantech\'s cash flow generating power, the new revenue recognition\npronouncement makes it unlikely that the company will reflect a profit until\nfiscal 2008. While there can be no assurance of profit in fiscal 2008, if\nbusiness remains at current levels, the company expects revenues recognized from\nprior periods will equal the revenue being deferred to future periods.\n\n         For the twelve months ended March 31, 2004, the company is showing a\nnet loss of $0.5 million or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to net income of\n$1.5 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the fiscal year 2003, with $229.5\nmillion of gross revenues not being recognized and being deferred to future\nperiods.\n\n         "Despite the reported loss, Warrantech\'s business grew in fiscal 2004,"\nsaid Joel San Antonio, Warrantech chairman and chief executive officer. "The\ngrowth was driven by our international and consumer service divisions, while\nrevenues from our automotive segment were lower. Overall gross revenues\nincreased from $118.1 million in 2002 to $147.8 million in 2003 and $149.3\nmillion in fiscal 2004. Over that same period, selling, general and\nadministrative expenses decreased."\n\n         "Warrantech\'s positive gross revenue growth and cost management were\nobscured by the new accounting policies which require that the majority of\nrevenue from new contract sales must be deferred to future periods. Reporting a\nnet loss when revenues increased and expenses were down is confusing, yet these\nresults are due to the new accounting policies. However, our mission remains\nclear: Warrantech will continue creating and delivering a range of innovative\nproducts\n\n                                 o Page 2 of 8\n', u'\n\nWarrantech Corporation                                             Aug. 24, 2004\nFY 2004 Financial Results\n\n\n                                     -more-\n\nwhile maximizing the service experience to the consumer," San Antonio said.\n\n\nGross Revenues\n\n         Gross revenues for the year ended March 31, 2004, were $149.3 million,\nan increase of 2 percent, compared to $146.8 million for the same period last\nyear. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2004, the international segment had\ngross revenues of $7.7 million, an increase of 44 percent compared to $5.4\nmillion in the corresponding period a year ago. For the twelve-month period\nended March 31, 2004, consumer products reported gross revenues of $39.0\nmillion, up 16 percent compared to $33.7 million in the previous year. For the\ntwelve months ended March 31, 2004, the automotive segment had gross revenues of\n$103.5 million, down 4 percent compared to $108.0 million in the prior year.\n\n\nDirect Costs\n\n         Direct costs are expenses related to the production and acquisition of\nservice contracts. These costs consist primarily of insurance premiums and\ncommission expenses. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, direct costs were\n$87.4 million, up 40% compared with $62.5 million in fiscal 2003.\n\n\nService, Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A)\n\n         For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, SG&A expenses were $29.9\nmillion, down $0.7\n\n                                 o Page 3 of 8\n', u'\n\nWarrantech Corporation                                             Aug. 24, 2004\nFY 2004 Financial Results\n\n\n                                     -more-\n\nmillion or 2 percent from $30.6 million in the prior year. The decrease in SG&A\nexpense was attributed to a rigorous cost containment program, increased\nreliance on new technology, and a decrease in legal expense resulting from the\nsettlement of several lawsuits during fiscal 2003. Employee and payroll expenses\nwere $17.8 million, up 2 percent due to a rise in health care costs during\nfiscal 2004 compared to $17.5 million during the same period a year ago. Rent\nexpense increased to $2.2 million for fiscal 2004, compared to $1.9 million for\nfiscal 2003, a result of the company\'s move to the new corporate headquarters in\nBedford, Texas. Over time, rent expense is expected to diminish as operations\nwere consolidated into one facility.\n\n\nIncome (Loss) from Operations\n\n         For the twelve months ended March 31, 2004, loss from operations was\n$1.3 million, compared to income from operations of $1.1 million in the prior\nyear.\n\n\nAbout Warrantech:\n- -----------------\nWarrantech Corporation administers and markets service contracts and\nafter-market warranties on automobiles, automotive components, recreational\nvehicles, appliances, jewelry, musical instruments, consumer electronics, homes,\ncomputer and computer peripherals for retailers, distributors and manufacturers.\nThe company continues to expand its domestic and global penetration, and now\nprovides its services in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and Latin\nAmerica.
