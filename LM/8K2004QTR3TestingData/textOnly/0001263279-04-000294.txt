Parker, President and CEO\nAleron H. Larson, Jr., Chairman\nKevin K. Nanke, CFO\n475 17th Street, Suite 1400\nDenver, Colorado 80202\n\nFor Immediate Release\n\n\n                     DELTA PETROLEUM CORPORATION ANNOUNCES\n       300% INCREASE IN FY2004 NET INCOME ON REVENUE OF $36.4 MILLION\n\n                   EBITDAX INCREASES 128% TO $21.6 MILLION\n\n     DENVER, Colorado (September 13, 2004) -- Delta Petroleum Corporation\n(NASDAQ: DPTR); (FRANKFURT STOCK EXCHANGE: DPE), an independent energy\nexploration and development company, today reported its operating results for\nthe quarter and fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.\n\n     For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004, total revenue from continuing\noperations increased 76% to $36.4 million, compared with $20.7 million in the\nprevious fiscal year.  Net income rose 302% to $5 million, or $0.17 per\ndiluted share, versus net income of $1.3 million, or $0.05 per diluted share,\nin FY2003.  EBITDAX (see reconciliation table at the end of this release)\nincreased 128%  to $21.6 million in FY2004, compared with $9.5 million in the\nprevious fiscal year.\n\n     The increases in revenue and net income were primarily due to a 40%\nincrease in production and somewhat higher oil and natural gas prices.\nProduction from continuing operations in FY2004 reached 7.23 Bcfe (billion\ncubic feet equivalent).  This compared with total production from continuing\noperations of 5.16 Bcfe for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003.  Production\nincreases reflect acquisitions and drilling development activities but do not\ninclude any significant contribution from properties that were acquired in the\nAlpine Resources transaction which closed on June 29, 2004.\n\n     The average price realized for oil in FY2004 approximated $33.09 per\nbarrel (Bbl) onshore and $22.11 per Bbl offshore, compared with $28.82 per Bbl\nonshore and $20.21 per Bbl offshore in the previous fiscal year.  The average\nprice realized for natural gas approximated $5.27 per thousand cubic feet\n(Mcf) in FY2004, versus $4.71 per Mcf in FY2003.  The Company recognized a\nmodest loss on hedging activities that averaged $0.14 per Mcf equivalent in\nFY2004.\n\n     "We are very pleased to report record results in virtually every category\nof our operations   revenue, income from continuing operations, net income and\nEBITDAX -- for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004," commented Roger A.\nParker, President and Chief Executive Officer of Delta Petroleum Corporation.\n"These results did not include any significant production and revenue\ncontributions from the Alpine Resources acquisition that occurred a few days\nprior to the end of our fiscal year.  This acquisition should have a very\nmeaningful impact upon our Fiscal 2005 operating results."\n\n     "Whereas the 83% increase in our proved reserves during Fiscal 2004 was\nprimarily due to acquisitions, a significant increase in drilling activities\nsince the end of the fiscal year should contribute substantially to production\nand reserve increases in the current fiscal year," continued Parker.  "Our\nmost active drilling programs are located in Washington County, Colorado,\nFremont County, Wyoming; and will begin soon on a number of the properties\nacquired from Alpine Resources in Texas."\n\n     For the three months ended June 30, 2004, total revenue from continuing\noperations increased 132% to $11.6 million, versus $5 million in the fourth\nquarter of the previous fiscal year.  Net income rose to $586,000, versus a\nnet loss of $595,000 in FY2003.\n\n                Total Reserves as of June 30, 2004 and Drilling\n                     Activity Subsequent to June 30, 2004\n\n     In its Form 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,\nDelta will report total proved reserves of 168 Bcfe as of June 30, 2004, which\nrepresented an 83% increase when compared with 92 Bcfe as of June 30, 2003.\nThe increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed during the most\nrecent fiscal year.  Drilling activity did not substantially impact proved\nreserves, because most of the capital expenditures related to drilling did not\noccur until late in the fiscal year.\n\n     A significant increase in drilling activity since the end of FY2004 has\nbegun to produce results.  To date, the Company has drilled or recompleted 12\nNiobrara formation wells and 3 "D" sand gas wells in Washington County,\nColorado, and management estimates that the new wells have added 6 Bcfe in\nproved reserves since June 30, 2004.  The Company is currently drilling\napproximately 12 wells per month on these properties.  We have also drilled\ntwo successful wells on our Willow Creek Unit in the Piceance Basin in Western\nColorado and recently began drilling a 15,500\' test well on our Howard Ranch\nproperties in the Wind River Basin in Wyoming.  In addition, drilling\ndevelopment is continuing in our Deerlick Creek Field in the Black Warrior\nBasin in Alabama.\n\n     Delta Petroleum Corporation is an oil and gas exploration and development\nCompany based in Denver, Colorado. The Company has producing properties in 15\nstates and interests in one producing federal unit and four undeveloped units\nlocated in federal waters offshore California near Santa Barbara.
