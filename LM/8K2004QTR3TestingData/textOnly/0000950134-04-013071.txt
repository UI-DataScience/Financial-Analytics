(NASDAQ:COCO) today\nreported operating results for its fiscal 2004 year and fourth quarter ended\nJune 30, 2004.\n\nFISCAL 2004 FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n- -     Revenues increased 56.3% to $217.1 million compared with $138.9 million in\n      the 2003 fourth quarter.\n\n- -     Operating income increased 2.1% to $30.0 million compared with $29.3\n      million in the corresponding prior-year period.\n\n- -     Net income increased 5.9% to $19.1 million compared with $18.0 million in\n      the 2003 fourth quarter.\n\nFISCAL 2004 HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n- -     Revenues increased 55.5% to $804.3 million compared with $517.3 million in\n      fiscal 2003.\n\n- -     Operating income increased 23.4% to $135.3 million compared with $109.7\n      million in fiscal 2003.\n\n- -     Net income increased 23.8% to $81.6 million compared with $65.9 million in\n      fiscal 2003.\n\nSame-school revenues increased 21.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004\ncompared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Same schools are defined as\nthose colleges that have been owned and operated by the company for four full\nquarters. Core growth revenues increased 26.0% in the fourth quarter of fiscal\n2004 compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Core growth is defined as\nthe increase in total revenues, excluding revenues attributable to colleges\nacquired within the last four full quarters.\n\nNet income for the fourth quarter was $19.1 million, or $0.20 per diluted share,\nin line with the company's revised guidance, and includes costs of approximately\n$2.1 million ($3.2 million pre-tax) or approximately $0.02 per\n\n\n                                     (more)\n", u'\nCorinthian Colleges, Inc.\n2-2-2\n\n\ndiluted share related to facility closings at LTU and severance charges. This\ncompares with net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of $18.0 million,\nor $0.20 per diluted share.\n\nNet income for fiscal 2004 rose 23.8% to $81.6 million, or $0.87 per diluted\nshare, also in line with the company\'s revised guidance, from $65.9 million, or\n$0.72 per diluted share, in fiscal 2003. This amount includes charges of\napproximately $3.9 million ($6.4 million pre-tax) or approximately $0.04 per\ndiluted share associated with both the impairment charge at LTU taken in the\nthird quarter of fiscal 2004 and the facility closing costs and severance costs\nreflected in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe weighted average number of shares outstanding and all per share calculations\nreflect the company\'s two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock\ndividend and paid March 23, 2004. The weighted average number of diluted shares\noutstanding for the 2004 fourth quarter and year end were 94.2 million and 94.0\nmillion, respectively, compared with 92.8 million and 92.1 million for the\nrespective periods in fiscal 2003.\n\nDavid G. Moore, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Fiscal 2004 was a\nyear of investment in the future of Corinthian, a year in which we acquired 57\ncolleges and 15 training centers, opened a record 10 new branch campuses and\nremodeled, relocated or expanded 35 additional campuses as we also expanded our\nextensive library of high quality curricula. Throughout this period of growth\nand investment, we remained focused on delivering to our students high quality,\nemployer-driven education in attractive facilities. Although the investments\nmade in fiscal 2004 have restrained our operating performance in the short-term,\nwe believe they establish a solid platform for Corinthian\'s future growth in\nNorth America."\n\nFurther underscoring Corinthian\'s investment in future growth, Corinthian\nadopted a record 147 programs into its schools in fiscal 2004, with 82 program\nadoptions into U.S. schools and 65 into Canadian schools. This compares with 50\nprogram adoptions in fiscal 2003, when the company only operated within the\nUnited States. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, Corinthian\'s campuses\nadopted 47 programs, with 39 program adoptions into colleges in the U.S. and\neight program adoptions into schools in Canada. Program adoptions are typically\ndilutive to earnings in the short term, but provide campuses and prospective\nstudents with relevant, high quality employer-driven curricula.\n\nIncome from operations for the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter amounted to\napproximately $30.0 million or 13.8% of revenues as indicated in the company\'s\npre-release of August 2, 2004. This compares with $29.3 million or 21.1% of\nrevenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and compared with $35.6 million or\n16.4% of revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. Income from operations\nfor fiscal 2004 increased 23.4% to $135.3 million or 16.8% of revenues compared\nwith $109.7 million or 21.2% of revenues in fiscal 2003.\n\n\n                                     (more)\n', u"\nCorinthian Colleges, Inc.\n3-3-3\n\n\nIncome from operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 reflects higher\neducational services expenses, marketing and admissions expenses as well as the\npreviously mentioned facility closing costs and severance expenses, partially\noffset by a reduction in general and administrative expenses.\n\nIncome from operations as a percent of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal\n2004 was further restrained by an increase in new branch campus openings, with\nthree new branch campuses opened during the 2004 fourth quarter contrasted to\ntwo opened in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. In total, Corinthian opened 10\nnew branch campuses during the full fiscal 2004, compared with six new branch\ncampuses opened during fiscal 2003. New branch campuses have typically achieved\nbreakeven between nine and 12 months after opening.\n\nAdditional factors contributing to the reduction in fourth quarter operating\nmargin were the acquisitions in fiscal 2004 that have lower operating margins\nthan typical Corinthian colleges and the campuses that were remodeled, expanded\nor relocated during fiscal 2004. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 amounted to\napproximately $64.7 million, more than double fiscal 2003's $30.8 million.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, educational services expenses increased to\n55.5% of revenues compared with 50.0% of revenues in the fourth quarter of\nfiscal 2003. The increase in educational services was due primarily to the\ninvestments Corinthian made in the future in acquisitions completed in fiscal\n2004, the 10 new branch campuses opened in fiscal 2004, the expansion,\nrelocation or remodel of 35 existing campuses and the adoption of 147 programs\ninto campuses. These investments in initiatives to drive future growth resulted\nin an increase in salaries and wages to 27.0% of revenues compared with 24.0% of\nrevenues in fiscal 2003. Additionally, rent and occupancy expenses increased to\n8.6% of revenues compared with 7.6% of revenues in fiscal 2003, classroom and\nbookstore costs rose to 6.0% of revenues compared with 5.7% of revenues in\nfiscal 2003, and depreciation and amortization increased to 2.4% of revenues\ncompared with 1.8% of revenues in fiscal 2003. Bad debt expenses increased to\n4.2% of revenues compared with 3.4% of revenues in fiscal 2003.\n\nEducational services expenses amounted to 52.1% of revenues for fiscal 2004,\ncompared with 48.6% of revenues in fiscal 2003.\n\nMarketing and admissions expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 amounted\nto $49.3 million or 22.7% of revenues compared with $28.2 million or 20.3% of\nrevenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Marketing and admissions expenses\nwere 22.5% of revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. During the fourth\nquarter of fiscal 2004, lead flow into the campuses in the U.S., excluding FMU\nOnline, was derived 28% from the Internet and 64% from sources such as\ntelevision, direct mail and newspaper advertising. Marketing and admissions\nexpenses amounted to 22.2% of revenues in fiscal 2004, compared with 20.6% of\nrevenues in fiscal 2003.\n\n\n                                     (more)\n", u"\nCorinthian Colleges, Inc.\n4-4-4\n\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004\namounted to $14.2 million or 6.5% of revenue compared with $11.9 million or 8.5%\nof revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and $19.3 million or 8.9% of\nrevenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. The improvement in general and\nadministrative expenses as a percent of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal\n2004 was due primarily to the reversal of a bonus accrual of approximately $3.1\nmillion. Corinthian accrues bonuses throughout the fiscal year based on\npre-determined operating results targets, and reversed the accrual after\noperating performance deteriorated in the fourth quarter. General and\nadministrative expenses amounted to 8.1% of revenues for fiscal 2004, compared\nwith 9.6% of revenues in fiscal 2003.\n\nImpairment, facility closings and severance expenses amounted to $3.2 million or\n1.5% of revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, and includes the\npreviously disclosed facility closing costs of the two LTU campuses in Southern\nCalifornia and severance expenses of approximately $900,000. Impairment,\nfacility closings and severance expenses for fiscal 2004 amounted to $6.4\nmillion or 0.8% of revenues and primarily consisted of the third quarter fiscal\n2004 impairment charge related to LTU of approximately $3.2 million in addition\nto the enumerated fourth quarter costs.\n\nADDITIONAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\nTotal student population rose to 64,810 at June 30, 2004, an increase of 49.9%\ncompared with 43,229 students at June 30, 2003. Same school student population\ngrew by 15.1% over the fourth quarter of last year.\n\nFor fiscal 2004, total student starts increased 55.4% and same school student\nstarts increased 16.6% when compared with fiscal 2003. Total new student starts\nfor the fourth quarter increased 51.0% to 21,258, and same school student starts\nfor the quarter rose 12.3% compared with 13.5% in the fourth quarter last year.\n\nExclusively online student population at Corinthian's FMU Online campus grew by\napproximately 266% to 2,035 students at June 15, 2004. During fiscal 2004,\nonline course registrations increased 58% to 43,046 compared with 27,271 in\nfiscal 2003. Total online course registrations for the fourth quarter of fiscal\n2004 increased to 12,824, up 68.4% from 7,615 online course registrations a year\nago. At June 30, 2004, Corinthian offered students a choice of 173 courses\nonline and 12 exclusively online accredited degrees. Three more exclusively\nonline degrees were added in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Corinthian\ncurrently offers 15 exclusively online degrees, including associate, bachelor\nand master's degrees in accounting, business, and criminal justice and associate\nand bachelor's degrees in paralegal, homeland security and computer information.\n\n\n                                     (more)\n", u'\nCorinthian Colleges, Inc.\n5-5-5\n\n\nBUSINESS OUTLOOK\n\nAs previously disclosed, Corinthian is providing forward looking guidance only\nfor earnings per diluted share and only for the then next fiscal quarter.
