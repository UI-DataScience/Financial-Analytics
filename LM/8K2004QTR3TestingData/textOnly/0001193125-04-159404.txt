(Nasdaq: BLSC)', u', a\ndesigner and marketer of computerized medical electro-diagnostic equipment and disposables, today reported financial results for the fiscal second quarter and six months ended August 31, 2004. The company reported strong sales growth in neurology\nand sleep systems, and in its international hearing business. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Second\nQuarter Results ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Net sales for the second quarter ended August 31, 2004,\nincreased 19.0 percent to $8.2 million, compared with $6.9 million for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. Gross profit margin decreased, however, to 67.1 percent from 67.6 percent for the same period of the prior fiscal year, due primarily\nto changes in product mix within electro-diagnostic products and systems. Total selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) for the quarter increased $192,000 to $3.3 million, compared to $3.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal\n2004. This increase was due primarily to expenses associated with the higher sales, partially offset by reductions in advertising and certain professional services. Research and development expense (R&D) increased $138,000 to $1.3 million,\ncompared to $1.1 million for the same period of the prior fiscal year, due primarily to higher software development costs. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Operating income for the quarter was $975,000, compared to $459,000 for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. Net income for the quarter was $703,000, or $0.15 per\ndiluted share, compared to $400,000, or $0.09 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Income tax expense of $301,000 was 30% of income before income taxes in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, compared to $81,000, or 17% of income\nbefore income taxes, in the same period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to lower research and experimentation tax credits recorded in fiscal 2005. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Six Months Results ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'For the six months ended August 31, 2004, net sales increased 9.4 percent to $14.5 million, compared with $13.2 million for the prior fiscal year. Gross profit margin decreased, however, to 67.1 percent from 67.4\npercent, due mainly to changes in product mix within electro-diagnostic products and systems. SG&A for the first six months of fiscal 2005 increased $385,000 to $6.3 million, compared to $5.9 million for the same period in fiscal 2004. The\nincrease was primarily due to higher sales and marketing costs related to the introduction of new disposable products and expenses associated with the higher sales, partially offset by lower telecommunication costs and reduced expenses for certain\nprofessional services. R&D increased $134,000 to $2.3 million, compared to $2.1 million in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to higher software development costs, partially offset by reduced consulting expenses. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The company had operating income of $1.1 million in the first half of fiscal 2005, compared\nto $837,000 for the first six months of fiscal 2004. Net income for the six months was $817,000, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared to $674,000, or $0.15 per diluted share, for the same period of the prior fiscal year. Income tax expense of\n$348,000 was 30% of income before income taxes in the first six months of fiscal 2005, compared to $203,000, or 23% of income before income taxes, in the same period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to lower research and experimentation tax credits\nrecorded in fiscal 2005. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2004, were\n$14.5 million, an increase of $1.8 million from the February 29, 2004 fiscal year end. Book value per share at the end of the fiscal 2005 second quarter increased to $5.05, up from $4.86 at the end of fiscal 2004. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\x93Our strong second quarter performance was led by a significant rebound in our domestic electro-diagnostic\nsystems,\x94 said Roderick G. Johnson, president and chief operating officer, commenting on the results. \x93We experienced double digit improvements in both our Ceegraph', u'\x99', u' and Sleepscan', u'\x99', u' products, with particularly strong results in sleep apnea monitoring systems. Domestic hearing system sales, which was led by our AuDX', u'\xae', u'\nhandheld hearing screener, slowed somewhat from recent levels, but still grew a respectable 8 percent in the first half compared to the first half of fiscal 2004. The quarter also benefited from strong international hearing system sales, which\novercame a slow first quarter to post 14 percent growth in the first six months of fiscal 2005 compared to the same period of fiscal 2004, led by the Navigator', u'\xae', u' Pro M\xb7A\xb7S\xb7T\xb7E\xb7R', u'\x99', u' and AEP.\x94 ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Looking Forward ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x93Based on the positive signs in the first half, we are hopeful that the momentum in our electro-diagnostic products can continue,\x94\nJohnson added. \x93Sleep apnea monitoring is becoming an increasingly important part of our electro-diagnostic systems business and should further benefit from the new Sleepscan VISION', u'\x99', u', which we began shipping in June. We\x92ve added some major new customers in the\nsleep area, as well as increasing sales to existing customers, and our strong emphasis on customer training also appears to be adding to the improved results. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x93The Navigator Pro continues to be our strongest product in the international marketplace, and though sales were only about even with last year domestically in\nthe first six months, we expect improving results going forward. Bio-logic was recently notified that the Navigator Pro M\xb7A\xb7S\xb7T\xb7E\xb7R has been given Frost & Sullivan\x92s 2004 Excellence in Technology Award in\nrecognition of the product\x92s innovative design that offers integrated solutions for hearing screening and diagnostics. M\xb7A\xb7S\xb7T\xb7E\xb7R operates on the cost effective Navigator Pro system, a modular diagnostic\nplatform that does not require advanced computer skills to operate. We are proud to have been chosen for this prestigious award, which should add to the already strong acceptance of this fine product in the marketplace. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x93Building on the success of our well-attended new technologies educational seminar\nseries presented last year, we are currently working with an initial five universities to implement A\xb7C\xb7E - Auditory Centers for Excellence - our innovative program in partnership with thought leaders in the hearing community. These\nfive institutions will serve as the model for the A\xb7C\xb7E program, which we plan to eventually offer at over ten sites across the country. This new program is intended to elevate the level of clinical competency of students, educators\nand practitioners through the power of continuing education, and will further enhance Bio-logic\x92s reputation as the industry leader in hearing diagnostics and infant screening. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x93During the second quarter we launched the new HALO Ear Muffin, our over-the-ear acoustic coupler that can be used with our\nABaer', u'\xae', u' and Navigator Pro M\xb7A\xb7S\xb7T\xb7E\xb7R systems. The HALO has also been demonstrated to be acoustically equivalent to the Natus', u'\xae', u' ALGO', u'\xae', u' Flexicoupler', u'\x99', u', and we intend to target our competitor\x92s\ncustomers with this high quality, lower cost alternative. Although just beginning to generate sales, the HALO has thus far been well-received in trials, and we expect that it will become a significant product in what we estimate to be approximately\na $20 million market,\x94 Johnson concluded.
