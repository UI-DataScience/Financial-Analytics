First Quarter Fiscal 2005 Conference Call', u'\nSeptember\xa02, 2004', u'\n', u'Jim McGinley, CEO\n\n', u'Good afternoon everyone. I\x92m Jim McGinley and welcome to Stratos\nInternational\x92s fiscal 2005 first quarter conference call.\n\n', u'Before we get started, I want to read to you our safe harbor agreement.\nInformation on this call contains predictions, estimates, and other\nforward-looking statements regarding anticipated revenue growth, customer\norders, manufacturing capacity and financial performance. All forward-looking\nstatements on this call are based on information available to the Company as of\nthe date hereof. And we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking\nstatements.\n\n', u'Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. And actual\nresults may differ materially from any future performance suggested. These\nfactors include rapid technological change in the communications industry,\nfluctuations in operating results, and competition.\n\n', u'Other risk factors that may affect the Company\x92s performance are listed in the\nCompany\x92s annual report on Form\xa010K and other reports filed from time to time\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors will be able to attain\nthe documents free of charge at the SEC\x92s Web site. In addition, comments and\ndocuments filed with the SEC by Stratos will be available free of charge from\nStratos\x92s Investor Relations.\n\n', u'With me today is David Slack, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief\nFinancial Officer.\n\n', u'We are very pleased to report better-than-expected sales for the first quarter.\nContinued growth in our optoelectronic and fiber optic products combined with\nthe acquisition of the RF Microwave business last year has provided significant\nsales gains from a year ago.\n\n', u'On a sequential basis, Optoelectronic product sales were up 6% from the fourth\nquarter with strong transceiver sales to the Telecom and enterprise markets.\nSales of fiber optic products were up 20% from the fourth quarter.\n\n', u'As expected, RF Microwave sales in Q1 were 3% lower than the fourth quarter.\n\n', u'The market breakout for the Company\x92s first quarter sales was 43% Telecom\nEnterprise, 34% Military, 22% Industrial & Other, and 2% in Video.\n\n', u'Overall, demand for the company\x92s products has increased for the past three\nquarters, especially in regards to the military markets. Total sales for the\nfirst quarter were $21\xa0million, representing a sequential increase of 7% over\nour consolidated sales of $19.7\xa0million in Q4.\n\n', u'During the past twelve months, we have made significant progress in a difficult\nenvironment to improve gross margins, reduce overhead, expand our core markets\nand increase the companies\n', u'\xa0\n', u'\n', u' PAGEBREAK ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'scale through diversification. This resulted in increasing the consolidated\ngross margins to the mid 30s from negative territory just 9\xa0months ago.\n\n', u'Key factors supporting this rapid improvement included acquiring the profitable\nbusiness of Sterling, the divestiture of two small unprofitable businesses,\nclosing six manufacturing facilities, traction in the US and European Military\nCommunications market, and focused product positioning on higher margin\nproducts within the Telecom and Enterprise markets.\n\n', u'As our RF/Microwave customers transition to higher bandwidth applications, or\nextended distances requiring optical technologies, we are strongly positioned\nto supply them. We are confident that the combinations of the company\x92s strong\nbrands will lead to increased customer penetration and sales in several strong\nmarkets in the future.\n\n', u'Incoming orders in RF Microwave continue to be broad based from customers and\nmarkets, with particular strength in the Military/Aerospace markets.\n\n', u'We continue to focus on transceivers and subsystem modules for the new and\nemerging Military and Broadcast/Video markets. Business for the Military\nSubsystems continues to expand as word-of-mouth referrals transition into\nproduct sample requests and prototype orders. Business from the Q4FY04 customer\nbase is now transitioning from prototype orders to production orders, for\ndelivery in Q2 and Q3 of fiscal 05. We expect our Q2 revenues for opt\nelectronic products for the military market to double from the first quarter.\n\n', u'In the passive fiber optic product area, we have moved our mix towards more\ncomplex value-added assemblies including Integrated passive and active modules,\nharsh environment assemblies and optical backplanes and flex circuits.\nExcellent progress has been made broadening the market sectors into which these\ncore technologies have been successfully applied.\n\n', u'In addition to the improvements on our top line, we are very pleased with the\nexcellent improvement in our margins across the entire company. Operation\x92s and\nproduct line management has executed above expectations over the last nine\nmonths.\n\n', u'The benefits of the consolidation and reorganization are in our bottom line.\nOur net loss this quarter was $393,000 versus $7.2\xa0million a year ago.\n\n', u'The shift to network-centric warfare has created new communication\nrequirements, driving the adoption of higher bandwidth technologies. Military\nneeds for large amounts of information are on the rise.\n\n', u'The transition to digital communications and a drive towards rapid field\ndeployment of forces and equipment have created significant opportunities for\nthe rollout of our advanced harsh environment fiber optic end-to-end solutions.\nField forces and remote sensors are sending back higher quantities of data,\nwhile at the same time, requirements from unmanned vehicles are adding a\ncompletely new dimension to communication needs.\n\n', u'In general, demand and the long-term outlook continues to improve for our\nproducts in the Military sector. New advanced radar systems i.e. BLOS, (for\nBeyond Line of Sight) are employing microwave feeds and fiber optic technology\nfor air, sea and land applications, all of\n', u'\xa0\n', u'\n', u' PAGEBREAK ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'which are creating demand for our RF microwave and optical products. As the\nadoption of harsh environment fiber optic technology accelerates, Stratos is\nuniquely positioned to benefit with opportunities for strong and sustained\ngrowth over the next decade.\n\n', u'During the quarter, the RF Microwave product group managed significant\nimprovement of operational efficiencies toward pre-consolidation excellence for\nthe Trompeter and Semflex product lines. Solid top line sales driven from\ncontinued strength in the Military/Aerospace sector coupled with significant\ncost reductions have returned RF Microwave to pre-bubble profitability levels.\nTrompeter was ranked #6 of 41 connector manufacturers in the 2004 Bishop and\nAssociates survey of performance indicators. The company is the performance\nleader when compared to direct product competitors.\n\n', u'We recently introduced a product line of transceivers and media converters to\nassist the Broadcast/Video market in the transition to high definition TV,\nparticularly where large venues are involved; for example, where the camera is\nfairly distant to the mobile studio facility. This technology transition has\ncreated a need for higher bandwidth solutions, including fiber optics.\n\n', u'Going forward, our focus remains on achieving profitability, improving gross\nmargins, and growing our revenues. Business conditions are improving but the\noptical communications industry is still somewhat constrained by overcapacity\nand low pricing.\n\n', u'We continue to scrutinize all of our product lines and product groups on a\nregular basis, all of which have time tables for continuing funding that depend\non profitability. R&D and new product programs are continuously monitored and\nadjusted to assure their ability to realize a fair return on these investments.\n\n', u'At this time, I\x92d like to turn the call over to Dave Slack, who\x92s going to talk\nin more detail about our financial performance for the quarter.\n\n', u'David Slack, CFO\n\n', u'Thank you Jim.\n\n', u'Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 were just over $21.0\xa0million,\nslightly exceeding the high end of 1st quarter estimate of $19.5 \x97 $21.0\nmillion released on June\xa024th. This represents a sequential increase of 7%\nfrom $19.7\xa0million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \x9104, and significantly\nhigher than the $6.6\xa0million recorded for the first quarter of fiscal \x9104.\nLegacy optoelectronics and fiber optic products contributed $10.5\xa0million of\nproduct sales in Q1, a sequential increase of 19% from Q4, while the RF\nMicrowave product lines acquired from Sterling contributed an additional $10.5\nmillion in sales for the quarter, a sequential decrease of 3%. Income from\nroyalties and license fees were $2.8\xa0million in Q1, which included a one-time\nlicense fee relating to a patent infringement settlement of $2.5\xa0million,\nbringing total revenues to $23.8\xa0million.\n\n', u'The net loss attributable to common shareholders for the first quarter of\nfiscal 2005 was $480,00 or $0.04 share, compared to a net loss of $7.0\xa0million\nor $0.52 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, and $7.3\xa0million or\n$0.99 per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Total weighted average\nshares outstanding remained at approximately 13.5\xa0million shares.\n\n\n', u'\xa0\n', u'\n', u' PAGEBREAK ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'We did not have any customers accounting for 10% or more of our net sales\nduring Q1.\n\n', u'While recent improvements in customer and market demand continue to be positive\nin several parts of our business, incoming orders did slow a bit and the final\nbook to bill ratio for Q1 was just slightly below 1, 0.98 to be exact. Total\nsales order backlog as of 07/31/2004 was $12.4\xa0million, compared to 13.1\nmillion as of 04-30-2004. Backlog as of 07-31-2004 for legacy optical products\ndecreased 8% from the end of Q4. However, orders have picked up a bit through\nthe first four weeks of August and total backlog has increased to $12.8\xa0million\nthrough that date.\n\n', u'Continued growth in Q1 for our optoelectronics and fiber optic products\ncombined with the addition of RF Microwave products has provided significant\nincreases in sales volume from Q1 \x9104. The completion of our consolidation\nefforts in the remaining internal manufacturing in our Chicago, UK, and Arizona\nfacilities has also improved our operating leverage. As a result, we posted a\ngross margin of 34.3% and $7.2\xa0million in gross profit, compared to a gross\nmargin of 27.7% and $5.5\xa0million in Q4 04. We\x92ve improved our gross margins\nsubstantially over the past year \x97 our gross margin for Q1 04 was a negative\n13.8% and a negative -906,000 in gross profit.\n\n', u'In addition to manufacturing consolidation, we have we continued to focus on\nmaterial cost reduction through continuing design improvements, scrap\nreduction, price decreases, and supply chain execution. These efforts have\nalso provided yield improvements providing better productivity and operating\nperformance on manufacturing labor & overhead costs.\n\n', u'All of these efforts have allowed us to eliminate the barriers to gross margin\nimprovement, and positioned us with the opportunity to continue to see\nimprovement in gross margins over the course of the next several quarters.\nWhile business levels have significantly improved since Q1 04, reports and\nguidance from others in the technology space have indicated that recovery to\nsustained growth is still inconsistent and uncertain. If those conditions\nimprove and based our best current information, the opportunity is still there\nfor our gross margins to continue to improve into mid 30s over the next four\nquarters.\n\n', u'We reduced our net operating loss in Q1 05 to $457,000, compared to a net\noperating loss of $8.9\xa0million for Q4 04, and $7.5\xa0million for Q1 04. Income\nfrom short-term investments was $64,000, resulting in a pre tax net loss\n$393,000, or $0.03 per share. Dividends paid to preferred shareholders were\n$88,000, resulting in a net loss attributable to common shareholders of\n$480,000, or $0.04 per share.\n\n', u'We ended Q1 with a balance of $37.4\xa0million in cash and short-term investments,\nan increase of approximately $400,000 from 04-30-2004. Sources and uses\nincluded: $1.5\xa0million generated by operations including a net $2.0\xa0million\nreceived from the previously discussed license fee, less a $1.6\xa0million\nincrease in net working capital, $209,000 used for capital expenditures, and\n$795,000 paid on long-term debt, plus $1.5\xa0million in proceeds from the\ndisposition of assets held for sale, and $95,000 received in proceeds from\nstock options, less payment of $88,000 in dividends to preferred shareholders.\nAverage DSO for trade accounts receivable for Q1 04 was 55\xa0days.
