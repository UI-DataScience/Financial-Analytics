At this time,\n                    all  participants  are in a  listen-only  mode and after the\n                    presentation  we will conduct a question and answer session.\n                    At the request of Dollar Financial Group, today's conference\n                    is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the meeting\n                    over to Mr.  Don  Gayhardt,  President  of Dollar  Financial\n                    Group. Sir, you may begin your call.\n\nD.Gayhardt          Great.  Thank you.  Good  afternoon,  everybody.  Thanks for\n                    joining us.  Before we begin with our 2004  fiscal  year-end\n                    operating  results  conference  call, I'd like to remind you\n                    that the  remarks  made during  this  conference  call about\n                    future   expectations,   trends,   plans,   forecasts,   and\n                    performance  for  Dollar  Financial  Group,  Inc.,  and  its\n                    markets are  forward-looking  statements within the means of\n                    the Private Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These\n                    forward-looking  statements  reflect  our  current  beliefs,\n                    estimates  and  expectations  that involve a number of risks\n                    and  uncertainties.   Listeners  are  cautioned  that  these\n                    forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual\n                    future  events or  performance  and are advised not to place\n                    any undue reliance on any  forward-looking  statements which\n                    speak only as of the date of this call.\n\n                    Factors that could effect  results are outlined in our press\n                    release dated August 27, 2004 and a more thorough listing of\n                    risk factors are discussed in our annual report on Form 10K.\n\n                    In  addition,  I will  remind  you  that we  have an  equity\n                    offering for our parent  company,  Dollar  Financial  Corp.,\n                    currently in registration with the SEC. As most of you know,\n                    we postponed our IPO at the end of July;  however,  it was a\n                    postponement,   not  a  cancellation  so  that  registration\n                    statement is still open with the SEC.\n\n                    With  that,  I'd  like to turn  it  over  to Jeff  for  some\n                    introductory   remarks   before  we  discuss  the  financial\n                    results.\n\nJ.Weiss             Thanks, Don. Good afternoon,  everyone.  We are very pleased\n                    to report another strong year. Don will give you more of the\n                    details but I believe the results  indicate more evidence of\n                    the secular  trends that we have often spoken of continue to\n                    accelerate  and the  steps  that we have  taken  to  improve\n                    profitability  and cash  generation  are continuing to drive\n                    improvements in our operations,  financial results,  capital\n                    position and financial flexibility.\n\n                    As we've  talked about  before,  we continue to believe that\n                    the  secular  trends  that have been  driving  our  business\n                    continue  to  accelerate.  It's my  view  that  the  barbell\n                    economy,  an economy of low-wage,  service sector workers at\n                    one end,  highly-paid  knowledge  workers  at the  other and\n                    unfortunately,  the  thinning  middle class at the center is\n                    becoming an accepted reality in all major markets.  And this\n                    acceptance   is  helping  to  bring  our  products  and  our\n                    businesses to the mainstream of the financial marketplace.\n\n\n\n                                       1\n", u"\n\n                    The economy in each of our three major markets  continues to\n                    perform  well.  While we are seeing some signs of moderation\n                    in the US, we still  believe that, at least from our vantage\n                    point with our target  customer  base,  job and wage  growth\n                    continues.  While a number of other  retails  have  reported\n                    that gas prices and other factors have  softened  sales over\n                    the  summer,  I think  it's  important  to note  that we are\n                    essentially  first in line  when it  comes  to our  customer\n                    spending.  We get  paid  either  out of the  paycheck  or on\n                    payday.  Consequently,  we think we are more  insulated from\n                    these problems, not immune, but more insulated.  Having said\n                    that,  I'd  like  to  take  a  few  minutes  to  review  our\n                    accomplishments during fiscal 2004.\n\n                    We added 17 new  company-owned  locations;  14 de novo sites\n                    and 3 acquired stores;  we increased our franchise base by a\n                    net 12 new  locations.  Our overall  financial  results were\n                    outstanding.  Don will give you more of the  details  later,\n                    but we recorded  record  revenue  with  adjusted  EBITDA and\n                    significant  increases in same-store  sales,  total revenue,\n                    store level and operating margins and net income.\n\n                    Transaction  volumes grew across the board. Check volume, as\n                    measured  by the face  amount of checks  cashed,  grew 7.8%;\n                    loan volume,  as measured by  company-funded  dollars  lent,\n                    grew 14% and our servicing  revenue grew 14.5%. We generated\n                    significant  free cash flow and now have ample liquidity and\n                    flexibility  to operate and grow our businesses in all three\n                    markets.\n\n                    We have an average  excess  cash  balance  of $16.7  million\n                    during  the  month  of June and we have  our  $53.5  million\n                    revolving  credit  facility as well.  We also prepaid our UK\n                    participation  facility at the end of June, which will lower\n                    our borrowing cost in fiscal 2005.\n\n                    Our credit  metrics  are well in line with our  expectations\n                    and recent  trends.  We  solidified  and grew  existing  key\n                    relationships,  our two banks/agent partners:  First Bank of\n                    Delaware and County Bank,  Western Union Money  Transfer and\n                    established  several new agent  relationships,  most notably\n                    with Visa and West Suburban Bank to exclusively  market Visa\n                    branded pre-paid cash products in the US.\n\n                    We  strengthened  our management  team in several key areas,\n                    most notably,  Randy Underwood has joined us as our new CFO,\n                    he joined in June;  ending  Don's  three  years  interim CFO\n                    term. Randy has a terrific background,  the Coleman Company,\n                    Thorn  Americas/Rent-a-Center  and  KPMG  Peat  Marwick.  We\n                    believe that he will be a terrific addition to our team.\n\n                    Now I'll turn it over to Don to provide  some more detail of\n                    the financial results for the year and the quarter,  as well\n                    as some guidance for 2005. Thanks.\n\nD.Gayhardt          Great.  Thanks, Jeff. Our June quarter was a terrific end to\n                    fiscal 2004. First, I have a few P&L highlights.  During the\n                    quarter,  total revenues increased 13.7% over the prior year\n                    to $63.1 million.  Comparable  store sales  increased  12.8%\n                    both by strong increases in US and Canadian loan fees and UK\n                    check  cashing  revenue.  I should  point out that  while we\n                    certainly  benefited from a weaker dollar,  same store sales\n                    in constant dollars, again, factoring out a currency impact,\n                    increased  10.6% in the  quarter.  Total check  cashing fees\n                    increased 6.9%; net lending revenue  increased 25% and other\n                    revenues increased 12.8%.\n\n                    Corporate  expenses for the 2004 fiscal fourth  quarter were\n                    $10.1  million or 16.0% of revenue  compared to $7.5 million\n                    and 13.6% of total revenue for the prior year period.  As we\n                    mentioned in our press  release,  a  significant  portion of\n                    this  increase  was  related  to costs  associated  with the\n                    revaluation of US dollar  denominated  debt held by our U.K.\n                    subsidiary  and the  modification  of our  foreign  currency\n                    hedging program at year-end.\n\n\n\n                                       2\n", u"\n\n                    I think it's important to note, as Jeff mentioned, we repaid\n                    that  debt  at  the  end  of  June  so  we  won't  have  any\n                    revaluation  costs running  through the P&L any more. And we\n                    also  revised  our  hedging  program  in June and as part of\n                    that, we liquidated puts that we ordinarily  would have held\n                    and amortized over much longer period of time.\n\n                    We believe  that a  meaningful  portion  of these  costs are\n                    non-recurring   and  we  feel   comfortable  that  corporate\n                    expenses  will be in the  range  of 13% as a  percentage  of\n                    sales going forward.\n\n                    Adjusted EBITDA  increased $2.6 million or 19.3%;  the $16.2\n                    million for the fiscal  fourth  quarter,  from $13.6 million\n                    for the prior year period.  I should point out that adjusted\n                    EBITDA is not an item prepared in accordance with GAAP and I\n                    encourage  you to review the net income to  adjusted  EBITDA\n                    reconciliation that was provided in our earnings release.\n\n                    Net income  increased  $3.3  million to $3.8 million for the\n                    fourth quarter, from $577,000 from the prior year period and\n                    this  increase  came despite a $277,000  pre-tax  charge for\n                    debt extinguishment  related again to the early repayment of\n                    the collateralized borrowing in the UK.\n\n                    During the quarter,  our income tax  provision was 30% which\n                    demonstrates  the impact of the changes  that we made to our\n                    tax   structure;   but  it  is  lower  than  our   projected\n                    sustainable rate of approximately  42%. As we conservatively\n                    use an  effective  tax rate for 41% for Canada for the first\n                    three quarters,  we simply trued up the Canadian rate to the\n                    recently  enacted  35.5%  rate and that most of the  change,\n                    there's  about a $1 million gap there and that's the true up\n                    that we made in the fourth  quarter.  Going  forward,  we're\n                    comfortable with approximately 42% effective tax rate.\n\n                    The  margin  expansion  that  we've seen over the past seven\n                    quarters  continued as our store  operating  margin  defines\n                    total  revenue less expenses  directly  related to operating\n                    our stores including certain regional  administrative costs;\n                    increased to 37.6% from 36.2% in the year ago period.\n\n                    Adjusted  EBITDA is a percentage of total revenue  increased\n                    to 25.8% for the  quarter  from  24.5%  for the  prior  year\n                    period.  This margin  expansion is a result of the operating\n                    leverage  inherent in our business  model and our control of\n                    corporate expenses.\n\n                    For the full year,  total revenue  increased  12.3% over the\n                    prior year period of $246.6  million with  comparable  store\n                    sales increasing  11.5%.  Total check cashing fees increased\n                    8.3%; net lending revenue  increased 18.1% and other revenue\n                    increased 10.8%.\n\n                    Corporate  expenses  for the full  fiscal  year  were  $32.8\n                    million, up 13.3% total revenue compared to $31.2 million or\n                    14.2% of total  revenue for the prior year  period.  Part of\n                    the  reduction in corporate  expenses is a result of revenue\n                    related to our previously  discussed  rationalization of our\n                    North American store support functions which we completed at\n                    the beginning of fiscal 2004.\n\n                    Adjusted  EBITDA  for the fiscal  year  ended June 30,  2004\n                    increased  from $13.1 million or 25.6% to $64.6 million from\n                    $51.4 million for the prior fiscal year.  Adjusted EBITDA as\n                    a percentage  of total  revenues  increased to 26.2% for the\n                    full fiscal year from 23.4% for the prior fiscal year.\n\n                    Net  income  increased  $2.8  million  or over  130% to $4.9\n                    million for the full fiscal year from $2.1  million in 2003.\n                    As with the  quarter  results,  we  achieved  this  increase\n                    despite significant debt extinguishment charges; the charges\n                    for the full year were $7.5 million  which  encompassed  the\n                    $220 million refinancing we did in November,  as well as the\n                    early extinguishment of the UK debt at the end of the fiscal\n                    year.\n\n                    As Jeff  mentioned,  our loss  metrics are well in line with\n                    our   expectation   and   continued   strong    performance,\n                    particularly  in the US strong credit quality and reductions\n                    in losses as a percentage of gross revenue. On the bad check\n                    side, bad check and cash shortages taken together were about\n\n\n                                       3\n", u"\n\n                    7.8% of check cashing fees versus 7.9% the prior year.\n\n                    Our provision for loan losses and servicing fee  adjustments\n                    was 20.3% of gross loan fees during 2004 compared with 23.5%\n                    in 2003. For the quarter,  this provision again, loan losses\n                    and servicing fee  adjustments as a percentage of gross loan\n                    fees is 20.7% versus 25.1% in the year ago June quarter.\n\n                    Probably  three things driving this  improvement:  One, as I\n                    mentioned,  the internal  improvements,  particularly in the\n                    US, that we continue to make in our  centralized  collection\n                    in customer service facilities.  Secondly, a continued shift\n                    in the overall lending mix in the lower-loss  environment of\n                    Canada. And thirdly,  an overall  improvement in delinquency\n                    rates on credit and  installment  loans.  Moody's  last week\n                    reported that credit card  delinquencies in the US fell to a\n                    four-year   low,   which  in  some   respects,   is  a  nice\n                    counterweight  to some of the retail sales reports that have\n                    been  in  the  news  recently  that  Jeff  mentioned  in his\n                    introduction.\n\n                    On the balance  sheet,  I'll just point out quickly the cash\n                    number of $69.2  million as of June 30 includes $3.4 million\n                    of excess  non-inventory  cash.  We had no borrowings on our\n                    credit  line.  Our $53.5  million US revolve or $10  million\n                    Canadian revolver at June 30th. During the June quarter, our\n                    peak  revolver  borrowings  were only at $1.7 million and we\n                    only used our line five days during the quarter.\n\n                    A  couple  other  notes  on  the  balance  sheet.   As  Jeff\n                    mentioned,   the  repayment  of  the  $8  million  of  other\n                    collateralized  borrowing  which,  in the asset  side of the\n                    balance  sheets also takes the $8 million  loans  receivable\n                    pledge and moves that back into the loans receivable pool or\n                    category.  Total  loans  receivable  grew  35.8%  which  are\n                    consistent with the 18% growth we saw in net fees as well as\n                    normal  shifting  of the mix into  Canada  and UK which will\n                    lower yielding loans so on average,  you have more portfolio\n                    needs to generate the fee increases that we've discussed.\n\n                    Most of the significant changes in the liability side of the\n                    balance  sheets  relates  to the  two-part  refinancings  we\n                    completed,  $220  million in  November  and the $21  million\n                    tack-on  loan we did in June.  For the fiscal  year,  we had\n                    capital  expenditures  of $8.7 million which  includes about\n                    $550,000 for three  stores we acquired in the June  quarter.\n                    These were in the UK. Approximately one-third of the overall\n                    $8.7  million  spending  was  for  the 17  newly  built  and\n                    acquired stores, a third is for store level  maintenance and\n                    a  third  is  for  corporate  and   information   technology\n                    spending.\n\n                    As we have  talked  about  before,  we  continue to look for\n                    well-managed and attractively priced acquisitions. We bought\n                    three stores in the UK in June. We have nothing  specific to\n                    report today, but we are more active in that market,  in the\n                    US, in Canada and in the UK and we're evaluating a number of\n                    interesting potential  transactions.  Again,  strategically,\n                    geographically  interesting and creative acquisitions from a\n                    leverage and value standpoint.\n\n                                       4\n", u"\n\n                    Now,  I'll talk for a second  about  guidance for the fiscal\n                    year ending June 30, 2005. As always, before we give you the\n                    numbers, I have to remind you that these statements are made\n                    as of this date and indicate only  expectations of Jeff, the\n                    rest  of  the  management  team  as  of  this  date.   These\n                    statements supercede any and all previous statements made by\n                    the  company   regarding   the  matters   addressed.   These\n                    statements  are  forward-looking  statements  and  cannot be\n                    guaranteed and may prove to be wrong.  This outlook is based\n                    upon various  assumptions  which include but are not limited\n                    to the  following:  no material  change in the  products and\n                    services offered in all locations as of June 30 of 2004. And\n                    no  material   adverse   results  remain  in  litigation  or\n                    regulatory  proceeding  against the company  that  currently\n                    exist or that may arise in the future.\n\n                    Having said that, from a store  standpoint,  we plan to open\n                    25-35 new  company-owned  stores  and  20-25  new  franchise\n                    locations  during fiscal year 2005.  Also,  given the strong\n                    performance of our business  during the 2004 fiscal year, we\n                    estimate  revenue  for the full  year will  range  from $261\n                    million  to  $266  million;  that's  growth  of  6-8% on the\n                    revenue line. And our adjusted EBITDA for the full year will\n                    range from $69  million to $71  million,  that's a growth of\n                    7-10% in adjusted EBITDA.\n\n                    With that, we will be happy to take any  questions  that you\n                    have.\n\nCoordinator         Thank you.  Please  stand by for the  questions to register.\n                    Our first question comes from Michelle Dragonetti,  CS First\n                    Boston.\n\nM.Dragonetti        Hi, guys.\n\nJ.Weiss             Hi, Michelle.\n\nD.Gayhardt          Hey, Michelle.\n\nM.Dragonetti        I just have a couple of quick  questions  for you.  With the\n                    store  expectations  for  '05,  do you  have a sense  of the\n                    geographic split there?\n\nD.Gayhardt          Our expectation is we will open a couple of stores in the US\n                    out of that group.  And probably the remaining group will be\n                    spilt about 65-70% in Canada and 30-35% in the UK.\n\nM.Dragonetti        And the stores for the US, does that  incorporate  the three\n                    franchised locations announced in your earnings release.\n\nD.Gayhardt          No,  those  were  incorporated  in the 20-25  new  franchise\n                    locations.  So we're saying 20-25 new  franchise  locations,\n                    most of those in Canada.\n\nM.Dragonetti        Okay. And can you give a little bit more  information  about\n                    the  franchise  agreement  announced?  I know  in the  past,\n                    you've discussed that there was good interest on the part of\n                    Canadian  existing  franchisees  for US franchises.  Is that\n                    where those  franchises  are going?  When do you expect them\n                    online?\n\nD.Gayhardt          The first franchise was with a non-Canadian  franchise whose\n                    franchise  we opened in the US. We are  experiencing  strong\n                    interest from Canadian franchisees and from non-franchisees.\n                    At this point,  I think it would be  premature  to say who's\n                    going to win the horse race for first  franchises in the US.\n                    We just don't know yet.\n\nM.Dragonetti        Do we have a sense of location?\n\nD.Gayhardt          Not yet.\n\nM.Dragonetti        Okay.\n\nD.Gayhardt          Primarily -\n\nJ.Weiss             It  will  probably  be in  areas  in  which  we are  already\n                    operating.\n\nD.Gayhardt          The Northwest and the West Coast.\n\nJ.Weiss             Right.\n\nM.Dragonetti        Okay.  And then,  can you just  talk a little  bit about the\n                    installment  product you talked  about?  Where is that being\n                    rolled out? How's that going, generally, what the process is\n                    there?\n\n                                       5\n", u"\n\nD.Gayhardt          We've been operating the installment  loan program in the UK\n                    and this is basically  taking - we've been  operating in the\n                    UK for about 18 months.  And this is essentially  taking our\n                    better-quality  payday  loan  customers  and for a lack of a\n                    better  term,  kind of  trading  them up into a  longer-term\n                    product that offers the flexibility of - it's a larger loan,\n                    offers an  extended  term and a lower rate to the  customer.\n                    We've  done some  marketing  sort of  outside  our  existing\n                    customer  base and sort of called  Greenfield  customers but\n                    most of the success  we've had,  both in terms of volume and\n                    in terms of the  credit  quality,  has been in the  existing\n                    payday loan  customers  who we know are good  customers  and\n                    moving them up to a different product.\n\n                    So I think  we've  had - I'd call it - a very  extended  and\n                    very  successful test in the UK and that is being rolled out\n                    to our UK stores.\n\n                    In the US and in Canada - in Canada,  we have a pilot that's\n                    been  operating  for, I think about three months now. In the\n                    US, it's really just in the process of being  piloted  right\n                    now. But again, the expectation  won't be that this is going\n                    to be a  product  that  would  any way,  from a volume  or a\n                    profitability  standpoint,  impact our  results  the way the\n                    payday loan product does.\n\n                    But we think there's  certainly a number of  businesses  out\n                    there that  compete with this kind of a product and our view\n                    is that if we have good quality payday customers,  we may as\n                    well  capture that  business  because  they're  likely to be\n                    trading up and the business goes somewhere else.\n\nJ.Weiss             And it advances our ability to leverage our technology, both\n                    in Salt Lake City and elsewhere, in order to track potential\n                    customers  and to make  sure  that our  credit  and  control\n                    apparatus is equal to the task of both  granting  credit and\n                    having  successful  collection  activity.   And  that's  yet\n                    another advantage of the centralized credit facility.\n\nM.Dragonetti        How has the credit performance been on that product?\n\nD.Gayhardt          On the installment lending product?\n\nM.Dragonetti        Yes.\n\nD.Gayhardt          It's been  good.  Delinquencies  generally  run a little bit\n                    higher than what we've seen in the payday product.  But as a\n                    percentage  of revenue,  come down to about where our payday\n                    loan borrowers perform as a percentage of gross fees. It's a\n                    little  bit more work to  collect  those  but it's  still an\n                    acceptable net yield to us.\n\nM.Dragonetti        Okay.  And then just finally,  any sense of valuation of the\n                    discussed  rollout from  Wal-Mart of the  extension of their\n                    check-cashing products?\n\nD.Gayhardt          Let's start with maybe the ending comment which is, we still\n                    haven't seen any real impact from that in our US operations.\n                    And we believed  that the product that  they're  offering is\n                    essentially  a solid-gold  check  cashing  product,  you get\n                    preprinted   payroll  checks  from   nationally   recognized\n                    employers  and  that's  not a core  component  of our  check\n                    cashing  business right now. We're cashing many  handwritten\n                    payroll checks. They'll only cash checks from McDonalds. Our\n                    core  customer  works for Joe Sand. We talked about Joe Sand\n                    and Gravel or Mary's Nail Salon.\n\n                    Certainly  the  US  is  part  of  a  more   competitive   US\n                    check-cashing  market,  but we  haven't  seen  the  material\n                    impact from it.  Again,  only about 20-30% of our stores are\n                    proximate to a Wal-Mart  location.  And in fact,  we've seen\n                    areas - the mystery  shopping  reports that we just got last\n                    week  are  that a lot  of  the  initial  point  of  purchase\n                    signage, etc., has come down. So it's not, if you walk into,\n                    as a new customer,  into Wal-Mart today, you're probably not\n                    even going to know it's available as a service.\n\n                                       6\n", u"\n\nJ.Weiss             Moreover,  for the same category of check,  their pricing is\n                    kind  of the  industry  pricing  so  there  really  isn't  a\n                    significant   pricing   advantage  to  doing  that  task  in\n                    Wal-Mart.\n\nM.Dragonetti        Right. And then that 20-30% overlap is just from geographic.\n                    It doesn't speak to the fact that they are more selective in\n                    the type of check, right?\n\nD.Gayhardt          Correct.\n\nJ.Weiss             Right. That's just overall.  Twenty percent is within a mile\n                    of our stores and 30% would be within the same zip code.  It\n                    depends on how you want to draw the map.\n\nM.Dragonetti        Right. Okay.\n\nD.Gayhardt          Okay.  And Michelle,  one more part I forgot to mention,  on\n                    the  installment  loans,  just as a bigger  than a  breadbox\n                    point,  the  balance of UK  installment  loans for us now is\n                    about $3  million  and  that's  included  in other  consumer\n                    lending receivables.\n\nM.Dragonetti        Okay. Great, thanks.\n\nD.Gayhardt          ... US dollars.\n\nM.Dragonetti        Thanks.\n\nCoordinator         We have a question from Michael Temple, Pioneer Investments.\n\nM.Temple            Gentlemen,  hi.  I was  wondering  if you  could  clear up a\n                    couple of things for me. You may have mentioned this on your\n                    call,  but I didn't  catch it.  As I look at your  March 31,\n                    2004 balance  sheet and the June 30, 2004 balance  sheet,  I\n                    see a drop in cash of $10 million and an increase in debt of\n                    about $20 million.  Now, my guess is - and correct me if I'm\n                    wrong - that the $20 million  tack-on  which is the increase\n                    in debt  went to  reduce  additional  paid on  capital - I'm\n                    assuming that was a dividend of the parent?\n\nD.Gayhardt          That's  right.  That was a dividend  to the parent to redeem\n                    zero coupon discount notes that are at our parent level.\n\nM.Temple            And that don't show up on the balance sheet here.\n\nD.Gayhardt          They don't  show up on the  balance  sheet of the  operating\n                    company, right.\n\nM.Temple            Great.  Okay. And then in terms of the refinancing of the $8\n                    million,  the early pay down of the $8 million  was that not\n                    on the balance  sheet as well?  Was that  off-balance  sheet\n                    financing?\n\nD.Gayhardt          No, that's on the March 30 balance sheet.\n\nM.Temple            And where does that show up?\n\nD.Gayhardt          As other collateralized borrowers.\n\nM.Temple            Other collateralized borrowers.\n\nD.Gayhardt          Eight million.\n\nM.Temple            Okay. So, we're pretty much done with that, then?\n\nD.Gayhardt          Yes, we repaid the entire $8 million on June 30th.\n\nM.Temple            Okay. And then is that why cash went down as much as it did?\n\nD.Gayhardt          Actually,  cash is - as I mentioned,  with the  exception of\n                    the $3 million or so, cash is basically  inventory  cash and\n                    what  going to  impact  cash is the day of the week on which\n                    the reporting period closes. So if you close on a Friday, if\n                    the  Friday  is the  30th  or the  31st  at the  end of your\n                    quarter,  you're going to have higher cash  balances to meet\n                    check cashing and loan needs.  If it's a  Tuesday/Wednesday,\n                    you're going to have lower. I don't have a calendar in front\n                    of me.\n\n                                       7\n", u"\n\nM.Temple            No, that's fine. I understand.\n\nD.Gayhardt          But I think if you  probably  look,  you'll  find that March\n                    31st was a - my  recollection  is that that was  towards the\n                    end of the week and - we'll get a calendar.  If that doesn't\n                    clear it up, we can follow up.\n\nM.Temple            Well,  is  there  any  way to  give  us a  sense  of what is\n                    available  for  corporate  purposes  versus  how  much is in\n                    inventory at the various stores?\n\nD.Gayhardt          Well, yes. As I mentioned,  what we do is kind of smooth out\n                    the variances within the week. I think Jeff mentioned in his\n                    opening  comments,  either  mine or Jeff.  But we have $16.7\n                    million of -\n\nJ.Weiss             - excess cash on the balance sheet.  And we have essentially\n                    an undrawn $53.5 million revolver.\n\nD.Gayhardt          Yes.  That was during the month of June.  If you take the 30\n                    days ending June 30th,  the average day we had $16.7 million\n                    in the bank.\n\nM.Temple            I'm just  trying  to get a sense of your  liquidity  profile\n                    given the  statement  that you might be  looking  at several\n                    acquisitions next year. Are any of them potentially large in\n                    size, or would that necessitate the actual completion of the\n                    IPO that you're talking about?\n\nD.Gayhardt          Nothing we're currently in any active  discussion with is of\n                    the size that would require outside financing.\n\nM.Temple            Okay.  Fair enough.  And you've  given us some  guidance for\n                    EBITDA  next  year.  Do you have  any  guidance  for  cap-X,\n                    additional investments,  working capital, that type of thing\n                    so we can get a better  sense of how much free cash flow you\n                    may or may not be able to generate?\n\nD.Gayhardt          I think  in terms  of  cap-ex,  you'll  probably  see  cap-X\n                    increase with a few more new stores, increase from $8.7 into\n                    the range of $9 to $10 million.\n\nM.Temple            Okay.\n\nD.Gayhardt          In terms of working capital,  as a rule of thumb, and again,\n                    remember  the same thing I just talked about in terms of the\n                    way the days move around,  it makes it very hard to say. You\n                    could get a working  capital  amount for the year that looks\n                    very strange  based upon June 30, '05, the day on which that\n                    - the reporting ...\n\nJ.Weiss             The day of the week on which that falls.\n\nD.Gayhardt          But  generally,  we say  somewhere in the range of 12-15% of\n                    the growth in sales  dollars is - you have to reinvest  that\n                    in terms of working  capital to  support  again,  additional\n                    cash in the stores, loan balances, etc.\n\nM.Temple            Now, does that get affected at all by the  additional  store\n                    openings? Is a multiplier effect?\n\nD.Gayhardt          A  full-service  store costs us about  $110,000 to build and\n                    $50,000 or $60,000 of working  capital.  So 12-15% of growth\n                    in sales plus $50-$60,000 per store.\n\nM.Temple            Okay, great. And then finally,  the quarter looked great but\n                    the one number that was a little bit disconcerting, although\n                    clearly   didn't  affect  results  much  was  the  corporate\n                    overhead.  You correctly pointed out that it's only slightly\n                    higher than it was last year,  but if you look at the trend,\n                    the  trend is that  it's  creeping  up  quite  substantially\n                    year-over-year  and  even   quarter-over-quarter   from  the\n                    December quarter to the March quarter to the June quarter.\n\n                    Is that just in relationship to the IPO expenses and the due\n                    diligence therein or is there something else going on?\n\nD.Gayhardt          No, the IPO expenses  are  capitalized  or actually  they're\n                    deducted  from  equity so there  aren't any IPO  expenses in\n                    there.  Again,  a big  chunk of it is the  currency  stuff I\n                    talked about is on the order of $900,000 or so. Also,  given\n                    the  performance  of  the  business,   we  had  some  higher\n                    incentive  awards as well.  So probably some of that will be\n                    smoothed out a little bit more as we go forward.\n\n                                       8\n", u"\n\nM.Temple            Okay. Well, gentlemen,  it's been a great story and I'm very\n                    pleased with the investment. So, keep it up.\n\nD.Gayhardt          Thank you.\n\nJ.Weiss             Thanks.\n\nCoordinator         Christopher Brown, Barclays Global Investors.\n\nC.Brown             Great quarter, guys.\n\nD.Gayhardt          Hey, Chris.\n\nJ.Weiss             Hey, Chris.\n\nC.Brown             Hi. I just  want to ask you a  couple  questions  about  the\n                    Hold-Co  notes and the IPO - any new thoughts  about how you\n                    might pay those  off and the  timing of the IPO,  when or if\n                    you might bring that back?\n\nD.Gayhardt          You know I can't say anything.\n\nC.Brown             I thought I'd ask.\n\nD.Gayhardt          We continue to valuate  what's  going on in the market.  And\n                    when we have news to tell you, then we'll tell you.\n\nC.Brown             Or ultimately, you could tell us.\n\nD.Gayhardt          Yes. There was a postponement, not a cancellation.\n\nC.Brown             Okay. And other than that, there's no other plans to pay off\n                    the Hold-Co notes?\n\nD.Gayhardt          No, I think we've  talked about it before.  Obviously  those\n                    are  high-rate  notes  and as you  line  up  your  corporate\n                    financing  priorities,  paying off your  higher-rate debt is\n                    much more of a priority. So it's certainly a focus of ours.\n\nC.Brown             Okay. And separate from all that, all the new store openings\n                    that you have, both  company-owned and franchised,  is there\n                    any reason why you're  focused  more  outside the US than in\n                    the US?\n\nD.Gayhardt          Well,  I think we've spoken to this  before.  In Canada,  we\n                    essentially  have the only  national  brand;  we're the only\n                    national  provider.  The  Canadian  stores have our terrific\n                    return for us, they ramp up very rapidly. In the UK, we are,\n                    I guess,  kind of in the  childhood of the same  position we\n                    are in Canada.  We're the only  national  player;  we're the\n                    largest by a factor of five or ten.  It's  still  Greenfield\n                    days in the UK so I would say for  competitive and strategic\n                    reasons, the deployment of capital in the UK and Canada have\n                    been much better deployments.\n\n                    Now, the US is a terrific  market and  deployment of capital\n                    there also yields terrific results, but in comparison to the\n                    results  from  Canada and the UK,  they're not quite as good\n                    and hence we emphasize those jurisdictions. Although I think\n                    you  will  see that we will  find  alternative  distribution\n                    platforms in the US such as  franchising  which we intend to\n                    grow.\n\nC.Brown             Okay. And a separate  question and this may be hard to get a\n                    feel for, is your market share both in the US and in the UK,\n                    do you  see  some of your  other  competitors  - how are you\n                    growth in relative to the overall market?\n\nD.Gayhardt          Well,  you know,  this is an industry in which  statistics -\n                    there  is  really  no  central   repository  of  statistical\n                    information.  We get fragmentary information.  Certainly our\n                    market  share in  Canada  and the UK  continues  to grow and\n                    because our business  expands in the US, our business grows.\n                    Whether  our  market  share  is  growing  or the  market  is\n                    expanding, I don't know. And certainly,  we have the benefit\n                    of an expanding market in all three  countries.  But I don't\n                    know how we would break it out in the US.\n\nC.Brown             Okay.\n\n                                       9\n", u"\n\nD.Gayhardt          In the U.S.  there  is  approximately  25,000  check-cashing\n                    stores,  or maybe more.  So our market  share is very small.\n                    What I think we know in Canada  or in the UK, is that  based\n                    upon  what we know  from the  trade  association  there  is,\n                    larger competitors, we are, from a revenue standpoint, we're\n                    more than five times larger than our nearest competitor.\n\nC.Brown             Okay. Great, guys.\n\nD.Gayhardt          Great.
