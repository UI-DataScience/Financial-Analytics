(Nasdaq: AMKR) said today\nthat revenues for the third quarter ended September\xa030, 2004 are expected to be\napproximately $480\xa0million, or 3% lower than the second quarter of 2004,\ncompared with prior guidance of flat quarter- over-quarter revenue. Amkor\nexpects gross margin for the third quarter to be around 17% compared with prior\nguidance of around 19%. The net loss for the third quarter is expected to be\napproximately $0.13 cents per diluted share, compared with prior guidance of a\nnet loss of $0.07 to $0.09.\n\n\n', u'\x93Our revenue shortfall in the third quarter was due to declining customer\nforecasts during the quarter and lower-than-expected support of these\nforecasts, which we believe reflects an industry-wide inventory correction that\nhas distorted the normal seasonal trends in our business,\x94 said John Boruch,\nAmkor\x92s president and chief operating officer. \x93Our view is that the\nsemiconductor industry is experiencing a classical correction, and it is\nunclear at this time when business will improve.\x94\n\n\n', u'\x93Our gross margin shortfall in the third quarter was principally due to the\nimpact of Amkor\x92s operating leverage on a lower revenue stream. In addition, we\nanticipated that the product mix would improve in the quarter and partially\noffset higher factory costs associated with our capacity expansion and\ncorporate growth initiatives; however the product mix did not improve,\x94 said\nKen Joyce, Amkor\x92s chief financial officer.\n\n\n', u'Amkor will release third quarter financial results on Tuesday, October\xa026, 2004\nafter the market closes and will conduct a conference call at 5:00 p.m. Eastern\ntime on October\xa026 to discuss the third quarter results in more detail.
