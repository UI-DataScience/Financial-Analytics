On a year-over-year basis,\nrevenue grew by 111 percent. Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 was in\nthe upper half of OmniVision\'s target range of $95 million to $100 million,\nprovided on June 23, 2004.\n\nDiluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 were $0.32,\ncompared to $0.12 for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 and $0.34 for the fourth\nquarter of fiscal 2004. On a year-over-year basis, diluted earnings per share\ngrew by 167 percent. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal\n2005 exceeded OmniVision\'s target range of $0.29 to $0.31, also provided on June\n23, 2004.\n\nNet income for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 was $19.9 million, compared to\n$6.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 and $20.8 million for the\nfourth quarter of fiscal 2004. On a year-over-year basis, net income grew by 219\npercent.\n\n"Although our revenue declined by 1 percent quarter to quarter, reflecting a\ndecrease in demand from the digital camera market, we benefited from continued\ngrowth in shipments for cameraphones, driven by increased demand for our\n1.3-megapixel CameraChipTM," said Shaw Hong, president and chief executive\nofficer. "Our objective is to ramp production and shipment of our new\nOmniPixelTM generation of sensors during the October and January quarters. We\nbelieve that the combination of our established CameraChip technology and our\nnew OmniPixel technology gives OmniVision strong product offerings for all of\nour key markets."\n\nGross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 was $39.7 million, or 40.2\npercent of revenue, compared to $17.4 million, or 37.1 percent of revenue for\nthe first quarter of fiscal 2004 and $40.1 million, or 40.3 percent of revenue\nfor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Direct sales to original-equipment\nmanufacturers and value-added resellers accounted for 82 percent of revenue for\nthe first quarter of fiscal 2005, with the balance of 18 percent coming from\nsales through distributors.\n', u"\n\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by $32.5\nmillion during the quarter, to $247.7 million. Stockholders' equity increased by\n$20.9 million, to $320.9 million.\n\nFINANCIAL TARGETS\n\nTo manage the challenges of product transition during the second quarter of\nfiscal 2005, the Company plans to reduce production and shipment of established\nCameraChip products, while ramping production and shipment of new OmniPixel\nproducts. For the second quarter of fiscal 2005, ending October 31, 2004, the\nCompany announced target ranges of $80 million to $90 million for revenue and\n$0.20 to $0.25 for diluted earnings per share. The Company believes that revenue\nand diluted earnings per share will increase quarter to quarter in the third\nquarter of fiscal 2005, ending January 31, 2005, as it increases production of\nnew products.\n\nTELECONFERENCE\n\nAt 1:30 p.m. PDT (4:30 p.m. EDT) today, August 24, 2004, the Company will hold a\nteleconference to discuss financial results and future plans and prospects.

OmniVision's products are used\nto electronically capture analog and digital images in mass-market products such\nas cameraphones, digital still and video cameras, security systems, interactive\nvideo games, toys, personal computer cameras, personal digital assistants and\nautomotive imaging systems. The Company believes that its new OmniPixel\ntechnology enables its new generation of image sensors to deliver the light\nsensitivity, resolution, color fidelity and low noise of advanced CCD products,\nwhile also providing the proven advantages that designers have come to expect\nfrom OmniVision's CMOS solutions: low cost, high integration, low power\nconsumption, wide dynamic range and switchable still-image or video capture.\nOmniVision believes that its products enable manufacturers to build camera\nproducts that are smaller, less complex, more reliable, lower cost and more\npower efficient than cameras using traditional CCDs or multiple-chip CMOS image\nsensors. OmniVision Technologies is headquartered at 1341 Orleans Drive,\nSunnyvale, CA 94089. Additional information is available at www.ovt.com.\n\nOmniVision, CameraChip and OmniPixel are trademarks of OmniVision Technologies,\nInc.\n", u'\n\nSAFE-HARBOR STATEMENT\n\nCertain statements in this press release, including statements relating to the\nCompany\'s expectations regarding revenue and earnings per share for the quarter\nending October 31, 2004 and the quarter ending January 31, 2005 and the\nCompany\'s belief that the combination of established CameraChip technology and\nnew OmniPixel technology gives OmniVision strong product offerings for all of\nits key markets are "forward-looking statements" as defined in the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are\nbased on management\'s current expectations, and as a result of certain risks and\nuncertainties actual results may differ materially from those projected. These\nrisks and uncertainties include, without limitation, the following: the degree\nto which intense competition might affect the Company\'s ability to compete\nsuccessfully in current and emerging markets for image sensor products; risks\nassociated with the Company\'s ability to obtain design wins from camera, mobile\nphone and other image sensor device manufacturers, which could inhibit the\nCompany\'s ability to sustain and grow its business; risks associated with wafer\nmanufacturing yields and other manufacturing processes, which could materially\nand adversely affect the Company\'s revenue and earnings and its ability to\nsatisfy customer demand; risks associated with the Company\'s planned\nstreamlining and consolidation of manufacturing processes, which could adversely\naffect the Company\'s operating expenses and its ability to sustain and expand\nits business; risks associated with the development of current and emerging\nmarkets for CMOS image sensor products, generally, and the Company\'s products,\nspecifically, which could result in lower revenue and earnings and adversely\naffect the Company\'s business and prospects; risks associated with the Company\'s\nability to accurately forecast customer demand for its products, which could\nimpair the Company\'s ability to meet customer demand for CameraChip products and\ncould also result in excess inventory; risks associated with the development and\nproduction of new products, which would adversely affect the Company\'s ability\nto compete successfully in the CMOS image sensor market; the Company\'s\ndependence upon a few key customers, the loss of one or more of which could\nmaterially and adversely affect the Company\'s business and results of\noperations; uncertainties associated with the Company\'s decision to restate\ncertain of its fiscal 2004 quarterly results of operation; a decline in the\naverage selling price of the Company\'s products, which could result in a decline\nin the Company\'s revenue and gross margins; and the other risks detailed from\ntime to time in the Company\'s Securities and Exchange Commission filings and\nreports, including, but not limited to, the Company\'s most recent annual report\nfiled on Form 10-K, as amended.
