Reports Record Second Quarter 2005 Earnings\n\n     BEAUMONT, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 30, 2004--Conn\'s, Inc.\n(Nasdaq/NM:CONN), a specialty retailer of home appliances, consumer electronics,\nhome office products, bedding and lawn and garden products, today announced\nrecord results for the quarter and six months ended July 31, 2004.\n     Net income available for common stockholders for the second quarter\nincreased 37.6% to $6.8 million compared to $4.9 million for the second quarter\nof last year. Diluted earnings per share available for common stockholders\ndecreased 3.3% to $0.29 from $0.30 in the prior year. On a pro forma basis, as\nthough all shares issued in the initial public offering were outstanding in both\nperiods for the full period and IPO proceeds were used to pay-off existing\nbalance sheet debt, diluted earnings per share increased 16.0% to $0.29 for the\nquarter ended July 31, 2004 from $0.25 for the quarter ended July 31, 2003. Net\nrevenues for the quarter ended July 31, 2004 increased 16.6% to $136.6 million\ncompared with $117.1 million for the quarter ended July 31, 2003. This increase\nin revenue included net sales increases of $16.1 million, or 15.7%, and\nincreases from "Finance charges and other" of $3.4 million, or 23.5%. Same store\nsales (revenues earned in stores operated for the entirety of both periods)\nincreased 7.2% for the second quarter of fiscal 2005. One of the factors that\ncontributed to success in sales increases and profitability in the current\nquarter was the expansion of credit promotion programs in excess of one year;\nthe corresponding offset to these operational improvements included a higher use\nof cash to absorb receivable growth that does not qualify for funding under the\nasset-backed securitization program.\n     Net revenues for the six months ended July 31, 2004 increased 14.1% to\n$271.5 million compared with $237.9 million for the six months ended July 31,\n2003. This increase in revenue included net sales increases of $28.0 million, or\n13.4%, and increases from "Finance charges and other" of $5.6 million, or 19.7%.\nSame store sales increased 5.3% for the first six months of fiscal 2004. Net\nincome available for common stockholders for the six months ended July 31, 2004\nincreased 54.4% to $14.6 million compared to $9.4 million for the first six\nmonths of last year. Diluted earnings per share available for the common\nstockholder increased 8.9% to $0.61 from $0.56 in the prior year. On a pro forma\nbasis, as though all shares issued in the initial public offering were\noutstanding in both periods for the full period and IPO proceeds were used to\npay-off existing balance sheet debt, diluted earnings per share increased 24.5%\nto $0.61 for the six months ended July 31, 2004 from $0.49 for the six months\nended July 31, 2003.\n     "We continue to be pleased with our progress since becoming a public\ncompany," said Thomas J. Frank, Conn\'s chairman and chief executive officer. "We\nfeel that the same store sales performance for the quarter and the year\nindicates that we kept our commitment to potential investors to execute at an\nexceptional level. We believe the additional capital expenditures that we have\nrecently made remodeling our stores has already had a positive impact on our\noperations and will continue to generate an appropriate return on our\ninvestment. The continuation of our efforts to push our primary business in\nappliances and electronics and the emphasis that we have placed on track sales,\nbedding and lawn and garden categories seems to be providing positive results,\nboth at the top and bottom lines."\n\n     EPS Guidance\n\n     The Company also issued guidance for the third quarter ended Oct. 31, 2004\nof earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.25 to $0.27. Guidance issued\nfor the entire year continues to include earnings per diluted share of\napproximately $1.24 to $1.26, with comparable store sales increase in the mid\nsingle digit range.\n\n     Conference Call Information\n\n     Conn\'s, Inc. will host a conference call and audio webcast today, Aug. 30,\n2004 at 10:00 a.m., CST, to discuss financial results for the quarter ended July\n31, 2004.
