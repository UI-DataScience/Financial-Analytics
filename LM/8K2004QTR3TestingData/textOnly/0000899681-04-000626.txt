ANNOUNCES', u'\nFINANCIAL RESULTS FOR SIX MONTHS ENDED JULY 3, 2004', u'\n', u'Edison, NJ- AUGUST 23, 2004\n- - PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS, INC. (OTC Bulletin Board: PHFR) (\x93PFI\x94\nor the \x93Company\x94) announced today that it had consolidated net sales\nof $36.2 million for the six months ended July 3, 2004 compared with\nconsolidated net sales of $33.8 million for the comparable period of the prior\nyear, an increase of 7.3%. The increase is primarily due to the inclusion of the\nnet sales of Konsyl Pharmaceuticals Inc., which was acquired by PFI on May 15,\n2003. Konsyl\x92s net sales were $5.3 million in the current six-month period\nas compared to $1.3 million in the prior period. Net sales for PFI without\nKonsyl decreased $1.5 million or 4.7% to $31.0 million from the prior year. This\ndecrease in net sales was primarily due to lower prices and increased price\ncompetition in the Private Label Over-the-Counter market, decreased production\nfor certain contract manufacturing customers, and higher sales discounts and\nallowances. ', u'\n', u'Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales on a consolidated\nbasis was 86.1% for the six months ended July 3, 2004 as compared to 84.3% in\nthe prior period. Konsyl\x92s cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was\n51.8% for the current period. PFI\x92s cost of sales (excluding Konsyl) as a\npercentage of net sales increased to 92.0% for the current period from 85.2% for\nthe comparable period in the prior fiscal year due to increased competition in\nthe Over-the-Counter market, decreased production from certain contract\nmanufacturing customers, increased sales discounts and allowances due to higher\nretailer rebate programs and chargebacks from our private label customers and a\nshift in product mix in both the Private Label and Contract Manufacturing\nbusinesses to lower margin products. ', u'\n', u'Selling, general and administrative expenses were $7.7 million\nor 21.2% of net sales for the six months ended July 3, 2004 as compared to $5.3\nmillion or 15.7% of net sales in the prior year period. The increase of $2.4\nmillion is primarily due to Konsyl\x92s results being included as of May 16,\n2003. The remaining increase reflects higher distribution expenses, professional\nfees, insurance expenses and personnel expenses. ', u'\n', u'The Company incurred a net loss of $2.8 million or $.03 per\nshare for the six months ended July 3, 2004 as compared to a net loss of\n$915,000 or $.01 per share in the prior period.
