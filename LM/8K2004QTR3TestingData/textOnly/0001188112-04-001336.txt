Schwartz, Chairman, CEO and President of Aceto, stated, "2004 was\nAceto\'s best year in the Company\'s history, with sales, gross profit, net income\nand EPS all reaching record levels. Our three main business segments - Health\nSciences, Chemicals & Colorants, and Agrochemicals - all performed well, posting\ngrowth in sales and gross profit margins over fiscal 2003 levels. Additionally,\nfiscal 2004 represented a period of significant corporate developments,\nincluding a strategic acquisition that enhanced our earnings, a joint venture,\nand expansion into new segments and geographic markets, as highlighted below:\n\n     o    We acquired Pharma Waldhof, a distributor of biopharmaceuticals, from\n          Roche. The acquisition, which was immediately accretive to Aceto\'s\n          earnings, enabled us to enter the biopharmaceuticals market. Our\n          biopharmaceutical business is included within our Health Sciences\n          segment. Additionally, we are engaged in development activities to\n          enter the emerging generic biopharmaceuticals segment.\n\n     o    In line with our plan to expand our Agrochemicals segment, we formed a\n          joint venture with Nufarm Limited to capitalize on the imminent shift\n\n', u'\n\n          in the agrochemical supply channels. The joint venture acquired the\n          EPA labels for the herbicide Butoxone(R) and began marketing the\n          product, which has contributed to the strong performance of our\n          Agrochemicals segment.\n\n     o    We opened an office in Poland through which we are working with\n          pharmaceutical manufacturers in the ten countries that recently joined\n          the EU, supplying them with EU-approved active pharmaceutical\n          ingredients (APIs). We have begun to generate sales through this\n          initiative.\n\nDouglas Roth, CFO of Aceto added, "Also during fiscal 2004, we further\nstrengthened our financial position, which continues to provide a solid\nfoundation for Aceto\'s growth. At year-end, the Company had cash of $32.3\nmillion and zero debt, as we paid off our remaining outstanding short-term debt\nof $1.3 million during the fourth quarter. Our working capital increased to\n$84.1 million, and our shareholders\' equity increased to $100.3 million, a\nmilestone for Aceto."\n\nMr. Roth further stated, "Our results were positively impacted by a reduced\neffective tax rate of 24.4% for fiscal 2004, down from last year\'s rate of\n29.2%. This reduction was driven by strong earnings contribution from our\nsubsidiaries located in low tax jurisdictions. We expect this trend to\ncontinue."\n\nMr. Schwartz continued, "For fiscal 2005, we are focused on organic growth in\neach of our main business segments, namely, launching new APIs and nutritionals\nin our Health Sciences segment, expanding worldwide sales in our Chemicals &\nColorants group, and further developing our Agrochemicals segment by acquiring\nadditional new products for distribution and intellectual property. In addition,\nwe are continuing to strengthen our sourcing operations in China and India,\nwhich is the backbone of our business.\n\n"We are also pursuing the following new endeavors:\n\n     o    We are moving forward with the market development of products for the\n          emerging generic biopharmaceutical industry. In this regard, we expect\n          to generate initial commercial sales in the next 18 months based on\n          certain regulatory pathways already in place.\n\n     o    Another area of potential growth for Aceto is organic color pigments,\n          one of the fastest growing segments of the chemical industry due to\n          the increasing use of color in newspapers and magazines. We have been\n          conducting market development in this area for over a year, and have\n          begun to record commercial sales.\n\n     o    Additionally, the Company has developed a patent-pending product that\n          abates odors emitted from landfills, which is an important\n          environmental, health and safety issue. Initial feedback from the\n          market has been very positive, and one major landfill operator plans\n          to commence a full-scale test shortly."\n\nMr. Schwartz concluded, "These endeavors I highlighted are made possible by our\nextremely talented global management team of 26 who average 18 years with Aceto,\nas well as our highly skilled staff. We remain enthusiastic about the Company\'s\nprospects based on the growth initiatives we have in place, and our\n\n', u'\n\nsuccess in executing on our plans to date. In terms of financial guidance, we\nexpect to earn $0.21 - 0.24 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal\n2005. We look forward to updating you with our continued progress."\n\nCONFERENCE CALL\nLeonard S.
