(NYSE: KMX) today reported sales\nfor the second quarter ended August 31, 2004.\n\no  Total sales rose 7% to $1.32 billion from $1.24 billion in the same period\n   last year.\n\no  Total used unit sales rose 4% for the quarter.\n\no  Comparable store used unit sales declined 7% for the quarter.\n\no  The company now expects second quarter earnings of approximately 27 cents per\n   share.\n\nSales Commentary\n- ----------------\n\n"We continue to be reassured by the fact that our stores are executing well in a\ndifficult sales environment," said Austin Ligon, president and chief executive\nofficer. "The sales volatility and weakness that we experienced in June and\nJuly, and especially in early August, continued through the end of the quarter.\nAugust results also suffered from the effects of tropical storms on our Florida\nand mid-Atlantic stores. Nonetheless, we remain confident that our superior\nconsumer offer is allowing us to maintain or gain used car market share."\n\n\nAddition of Subprime Finance Provider\n- -------------------------------------\n\nDuring the second quarter, CarMax added a new third-party finance provider\nfocused on subprime customers, Drive Financial Services. Drive was rolled out to\nCarMax\'s entire used car superstore base during the first half of August,\nfollowing more than nine months of testing in selected stores. At CarMax,\ncustomers who have been turned down by all of the other in-store finance\nproviders may qualify for Drive financing. Drive offers financing to customers\nwithin carefully constructed parameters, including vehicle price, year, make,\nand mileage; payment-to-income ratios; and minimum down payments. As is\ncustomary in the subprime finance industry, Drive purchases the loan contracts\nat a discount.\n\n\n\n                                    - more -\n\n', u'\nCarMax, Inc.\nPage 2 of 4\n\n\n\nFor the second quarter, used car sales financed by Drive had a modest effect on\noverall sales, given the timing of the rollout. "We believe Drive represents an\nopportunity to provide us incremental sales and some incremental profit," said\nLigon. "It is still too early to determine the ultimate incremental sales that\nmay be provided by Drive, given the time required to build consumer awareness of\nthis new financing opportunity."\n\nSecond Quarter Earnings Expectations\n- ------------------------------------\n\n"For the second quarter, we now expect earnings per share of approximately 27\ncents," Ligon said. "We plan to offer guidance for our third quarter when we\nrelease our second quarter earnings report on September 20."\n\nStore Openings\n- --------------\n\nCarMax opened three superstores during the second quarter, entering the Austin,\nTex., market with a standard superstore and adding satellite superstores in\nWinston-Salem, N.C., in the Greensboro market, and in Fayetteville, N.C., in the\nRaleigh market. The company has opened six superstores thus far in fiscal 2005\nand now plans to add three superstores during the second half of the fiscal\nyear. The satellite superstore in Ontario in the Los Angeles market that had\nbeen scheduled to open at the end of the fiscal year is now scheduled to open\nearly in March 2005.\n\nEarnings Release and Conference Call Information\n- ------------------------------------------------\n\nCarMax will release second quarter earnings on Monday, September 20, 2004.
