Hemberger, executive vice president and chief\noperating officer of Pharmion. \x93Through our recent experience with the\napproval and launch of Vidaza in the United States, we recognize the real\nmedical need that exists and hope to be able to provide a new treatment option\nfor European physicians and their patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes.\x94\n\n', u'Vidaza has been granted Orphan Product Designation by the EMEA, which, if the\nMAA is approved, entitles the drug to ten years of market exclusivity for MDS\nin the European Union.\n\n', u'Vidaza is the first drug approved in the United States for the treatment of\nMDS. Vidaza received a full approval for all five subtypes of MDS from the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration on May\xa019, 2004. These subtypes include:\nrefractory anemia (RA)\xa0or refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) (if\naccompanied by neutropenia or thrombocytopenia or requiring transfusions),\nrefractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess\nblasts in transformation (RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL).\n\n', u'The U.S. and European submissions for Vidaza were based upon a National Cancer\nInstitute (NCI)\xa0sponsored Phase III study for the treatment of MDS, conducted\nby Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), and two supportive Phase II CALGB\nstudies, which were also sponsored by the NCI.\n\n\n', u'-more-\n\n\n\n', u'\xa0\n', u'\n', u' PAGEBREAK ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'Pharmion\x92s European Submission for Vidaza Accepted', u'\nPage Two\n\n', u'About Vidaza (azacitidine)\n\n', u'Azacitidine causes the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells\nthat are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. In addition\nto this direct cytotoxic effect on abnormal cells in the bone marrow,\nazacitidine is member of a class of drugs in development known as\n\x93hypomethylating\x94 or \x93demethylating\x94 agents. Methylation of DNA is a major\nmechanism regulating gene expression. Researchers have found that an increase\nin methylation of DNA can result in blockage of the activity of genes that\nregulate cell division and differentiation, known as \x93suppressor genes.\x94 With\nsuppressor gene expression blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing\nor promoting cancer. In in-vitro studies, researchers have found that\nazacitidine can reverse the methylation of DNA, which may restore normal\nfunction to genes that are critical for differentiation and proliferation.\n', u'\n', u'About MDS:\n\n', u'MDS is a bone marrow disorder characterized by the production of abnormally\nfunctioning, immature blood cells. The highest prevalence of MDS is in patients\nover 60\xa0years of age. Pharmion estimates there are approximately 30,000-40,000\nnew cases of MDS in the European Union each year. Survival rates range from six\nmonths to six years for the different subtypes of MDS. MDS can result in death\nfrom bleeding and infection in the majority of patients, and transformation to\nacute myelogenous leukemia (AML)\xa0occurs in up to 40\xa0percent of patients. The\nprognosis for patients transforming to AML is exceptionally poor.\n', u'\n', u'About Pharmion:\n\n', u'Pharmion is a pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing and\ncommercializing innovative products for the treatment of hematology and\noncology patients in the U.S., Europe and additional international markets.
