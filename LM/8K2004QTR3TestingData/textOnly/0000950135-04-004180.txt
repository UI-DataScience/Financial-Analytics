REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2004 OPERATING RESULTS\nPAGE 2\n\nNet sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 increased to $1,709,000 compared\nto $669,000 from the same period of 2003, an increase of $1,040,000 or 155%.\nLicense and associated fees increased due primarily to recording the final lump\nsum payment from Capgemini UK Plc ("Capgemini", formerly Cap Gemini Ernst and\nYoung UK Plc) of $1,142,000 which was earned upon signing the thirteenth\ncustomer of the eProcurement Scotland program in the first quarter of 2004 (this\nfee is non-recurring). License and associated fees include license fees, hosting\nfees, annual fees, joining fees and maintenance fees. Professional services fees\ndecreased by $112,000 from $259,000 in 2003 to $147,000 in 2004, reflecting less\nactual implementations and other professional services activities than were\nrecorded in the first quarter of 2003.\n\nOperating expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 were $1,673,000 compared\nto $2,409,000 in the 2003 quarter, a decrease of $736,000 or 30.6%. Throughout\n2003, the Company implemented cost containment measures designed to align its\noperating expenses with lower than anticipated revenues. Those measures included\npersonnel reductions throughout most functional and corporate areas. These\npersonnel reductions resulted in a decrease in personnel expense in the first\nquarter of 2004 of approximately $529,000 when compared to the first quarter of\n2003. In March 2004, the Company began hiring several staff in the U.K. and U.S.\n(support services) in order to service the expanding demand in the municipal\nmarket in the U.K. and in anticipation of the funding of the Company via the\nsale of Regulation S Shares in the U.K. (discussed below). The remaining\ndecrease in operating expenses from the 2003 quarter to the 2004 quarter is\nlargely due to a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense, as various\nCompany assets have been fully depreciated/amortized. The Company\'s first\nquarter operating expenses in 2003 were reduced by the reversal of a franchise\ntax accrual of $506,000, as payment was no longer deemed probable.\n\nThe Company reported an operating loss from continuing operations of $70,000 for\nthe quarter ended March 31, 2004 compared to a loss of $1,934,000 reported in\nthe comparable quarter of 2003, a decrease of $1,864,000 in the loss reported.\nThis smaller operating loss from continuing operations in the first quarter of\n2004 compared to the 2003 quarter was due primarily to the recognition of\nrevenue from the final lump sum payment from Capgemini, recorded as license and\nassociated fees revenue and the reduction in operating expenses.\n\nThe Company\'s net loss from continuing operations for the quarter ended March\n31, 2004 was $173,000, a decrease of $1,272,000 from the comparable quarterly\nloss in 2003 of $1,445,000, as a result of the factors discussed above.\n\nAt March 31, 2004, and prior to the sale of the Regulation S Shares, the\nCompany\'s principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of\n$143,000 and accounts receivable, net of $145,000.\n\nSUBSEQUENT EVENT AFFECTING LIQUIDITY\n\nOn April 16, 2004, the Company closed on the sale of 29,777,573 shares of its\nCommon Stock (the "Regulation S Shares") to investors in the U.K., and listed\nthe Regulation S Shares and its existing common shares on the AIM Market of the\nLondon Stock Exchange. The Company raised a total of approximately $3.6 million\nvia this issuance and sale of Regulation S Shares in the U.K, with net proceeds\nto the Company of approximately $3.2 million. The Regulation S Shares were sold\nat a price equal to the conversion rate of the Company\'s recent placements of\nDebentures in 2003 of $0.1246 per share. The funds derived from the sale of the\nRegulation S Shares will be used to support the Company\'s\n\n                                     -MORE-\n\n                10 OCEANA WAY - NORWOOD, MA 02062 --- VOICE (781)\n                        501-4333 --- FAX (781) 762-1540\n\n', u'\n\nELCOM INTERNATIONAL, INC. REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2004 OPERATING RESULTS\nPAGE 3\n\nworking capital requirements.\n\nFACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE PERFORMANCE\n\nA significant portion of the Company\'s revenues from continuing operations in\nthe first quarter of 2004 (approximately $1,142,000 after currency conversions)\nare from recognition of the final lump sum license fee from Capgemini related to\nthe eProcurement Scotland program. The eProcurement Scotland program is expected\nto be an ongoing source of revenues for the Company; however, because this was\nthe final lump sum payment, which is a non-recurring fee, it is anticipated the\nCompany\'s revenues will be lower in the remaining quarters of 2004. If the\nCompany, in conjunction with Capgemini, the primary contractor for the\neProcurement Scotland program, is unable to perform under this license, it would\nhave a significant effect on the Company\'s financial results.\n\nRobert J. Crowell, the Company\'s Chairman and CEO, stated, "Our first quarter\n2004 earnings do not yet reflect the increase in activity under our agreement\nwith Capgemini associated with the Scottish Executive, which began late last\nyear. Our first quarter results were substantially enhanced by the recognition\nto earnings of our final lump sum payment from Capgemini associated with the\nScottish Executive. Our underlying recurring revenues remain generally\nconsistent with Professional Services slightly less when compared to last year.\nWith our sales pipeline expanding, I expect to see continued increases in\nactivity under the Capgemini agreement, and with other channel partners and\nopportunities."\n\nMr. Crowell continued, "We are extremely pleased at our successful placement of\nshares in the U.K. and subsequent listing on the Alternative Investment Market\n("AIM"), which was effective April 16, 2004. With this financing in place, the\nCompany filed its Amendment Number 2 to its Form 10-K on May 10, 2004. This\namended filing contains an unqualified audit opinion as the Company is now\nregarded as a `going concern\'. The Company now stands to benefit from having a\nmore secure financial foundation and believes 2004 will represent a new\nbeginning for the Company as we begin to expand, especially through our channel\npartners."\n\nABOUT ELCOM INTERNATIONAL, INC.\n\nElcom International, Inc.

REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2004 OPERATING RESULTS\nPAGE 2\n\nNet sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 increased to $598,000 from\n$531,000 in the same period of 2003, an increase of $67,000, or 13%.\nProfessional services revenue increased primarily due an increase in\nimplementation activities in the U.K. related to the Scottish Executive\'s\neProcurement Scotland program. Licenses and associated fees decreased primarily\nas a result of reduced licensing activity in the U.S. in 2004 versus 2003. The\ndecrease in licenses and associated fees was more than offset by the increase in\nProfessional services revenue.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") for the quarter ended June\n30, 2004 were $1,465,000 compared to $2,457,000 in the 2003 quarter, a decrease\nof $992,000 or 40%. Throughout the first three quarters of 2003, the Company\nimplemented cost containment measures designed to align its SG&A expenses with\nlower than anticipated revenues. Those measures included personnel reductions\nthroughout most functional and corporate areas. Reductions in personnel resulted\nin a decrease in personnel expense in the second quarter of 2004 of\napproximately $333,000 when compared to the second quarter of 2003. In March\n2004, the Company began hiring several support services staff in the U.K. and\nU.S. in order to service the expanding demand in the municipal market in the\nU.K. and in anticipation of the funding of the Company via the sale of\nRegulation S Shares. The remaining decrease in SG&A from the 2003 quarter to the\n2004 quarter is due largely to a reduction in depreciation and amortization\nexpense, as various Company assets have been fully depreciated/amortized, as\nwell as credits negotiated with two service providers which resulted in one-time\ncredits of $196,000 in the 2004 quarter.\n\nThe Company reported a $1,020,000 operating loss from continuing operations for\nthe quarter ended June 30, 2004 compared to a loss of $2,129,000 reported in the\ncomparable quarter of 2003, a decrease in the reported loss of $1,109,000, or\n52%. This smaller operating loss from continuing operations in the first quarter\nof 2004 compared to the 2003 quarter was due to both the reduction in SG&A and\nthe increase in net sales.\n\nThe Company\'s net loss from continuing operations for the quarter ended June 30,\n2004 was $1,072,000, a decrease of $1,114,000 or 51% from the comparable\nquarterly loss in 2003 of $2,186,000, as a result of the factors discussed\nabove.\n\nNet sales for the six months ended June 30, 2004 increased to $2,307,000 from\n$1,200,000 in the same period of 2003, an increase of $1,107,000. Licenses and\nassociated fees increased primarily due to recording the fourth and final lump\nsum license payment from Capgemini UK Plc ("Capgemini", formerly, Cap Gemini\nErnst and Young UK Plc) of $1,142,000 which was earned upon signing the\nthirteenth customer of the eProcurement Scotland program in the first quarter of\n2004 (this license fee is non-recurring). Professional services fees increased\nby $114,000, from $505,000 in 2003 to $619,000 in 2004, reflecting more\nimplementation work and other professional services activities than were\nrecorded in the first six months of 2003.\n\nSG&A for the six months ended June 30, 2004 was $3,138,000 compared to\n$4,807,000 in the first half of 2003, a decrease of $1,669,000 or 35%.\nThroughout the first three quarters of 2003, the Company implemented cost\ncontainment measures designed to align its SG&A expenses with lower than\nanticipated revenues. Those measures included personnel reductions throughout\nmost functional and corporate areas. Reductions in personnel resulted in a\ndecrease in personnel expense in the first six months of 2004 of approximately\n$861,000 when compared to the first six months of 2003.

REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2004 OPERATING RESULTS\nPAGE 3\n\nCompany via the sale of Regulation S Shares. The remaining decrease in SG&A from\nthe first half of 2003 to the first half of 2004 is due largely to a reduction\nin depreciation and amortization expense, as various Company assets have been\nfully depreciated/amortized, as well as credits negotiated with two service\nproviders which resulted in one-time credits of $196,000 in the 2004 period. In\nthe first half of 2003 the Company\'s SG&A expenses were reduced by the reversal\nof a franchise tax accrual of $506,000, as payment was no longer deemed\nprobable.\n\nThe Company reported an operating loss from continuing operations of $1,090,000\nfor the six months ended June 30, 2004 compared to a loss of $4,063,000 reported\nin the comparable six months of 2003, a decrease in the reported loss of 73%, or\n$2,973,000. This smaller operating loss from continuing operations in the first\nsix months of 2004 compared to the first half of 2003 was due to both the\nreduction in SG&A and the increase in license and associated fees revenue in the\nfirst quarter of 2004, as described above.\n\nThe Company\'s net loss from continuing operations for the six months ended June\n30, 2004 was $1,245,000, a decrease of $2,386,000 from the $3,631,000 loss\nreported in the first half of 2003, as a result of the factors discussed above.\n\nRobert J. Crowell, the Company\'s Chairman and CEO, stated, "Our second quarter\n2004 earnings do not yet reflect the full anticipated increase in activity under\nour agreement with Capgemini associated with the Scottish Executive, which began\nlate last year. Our 2004 six-month results were substantially enhanced by the\nrecognition of our final lump sum payment from Capgemini associated with the\nScottish Executive. Elcom\'s sales pipeline is still strong but has slowed a bit\nduring the summer months; however the Company is in the process of responding to\nseveral tender requests and anticipates activity to accelerate after the summer.\nI expect to see more activity with our channel partners and additional\nopportunities in the municipal market in the U.K."\n\nFACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE PERFORMANCE\n\nA significant portion of the Company\'s revenues from continuing operations in\nthe first quarter of 2004 (approximately $1,142,000 after currency conversions)\nare from recognition of the final lump sum license fee from Capgemini related to\nthe eProcurement Scotland program. The eProcurement Scotland program is expected\nto be an ongoing source of revenues for the Company; however, because this was\nthe final lump sum payment and is a non-recurring fee, it is anticipated the\nCompany\'s revenues from this source will be lower in the remaining quarters of\n2004.\n\nSTATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT\n\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in\nthis press release could include forward-looking statements or information.
