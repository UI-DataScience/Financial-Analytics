The\nCompany reported Generally Accepted  Accounting  Principles  ("GAAP") net income\nfor the fourth quarter fiscal 2004 of $23.7 million. Included in net income is a\ntax-effected loss of approximately  $249,000 associated with the loss on sale of\ncertain  product  rights.  The Company  reported  fourth quarter fiscal 2003 net\nrevenues of $66.7 million with net income of $17.1 million, or $0.30 per diluted\nshare,  absent a $3.3 million  tax-effected  special charge  reported during the\nfourth  quarter  of fiscal  2003  associated  with a  research  and  development\ncollaboration.  Including the $3.3 million  tax-effected special charge reported\nduring the fourth  quarter of fiscal 2003,  Medicis  reported GAAP net income of\n$13.9 million, or $0.24 per diluted share for fourth quarter fiscal 2003.\n\nFor fiscal year 2004,  Medicis reported net revenue growth of approximately  23%\nto $303.7 million with  "if-converted" net income of $73.2 million, or $1.13 per\ndiluted share,  absent a $37.5 million  tax-effected  loss  associated  with the\nearly  extinguishment  of debt  reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 and\nabsent a $1.6 million tax-effected special charge associated with a research and\ndevelopment  collaboration  reported  in the  second  quarter  of  fiscal  2004.\nIncluded  in  net  income  is a  tax-effected  loss  of  approximately  $249,000\nassociated  with the  loss on sale of  certain  product  rights.  Including  the\nspecial  charges  and the loss on sale of certain  product  rights,  the Company\nreported GAAP net income of $30.8 million, or $0.52 per diluted share for fiscal\n2004.\n\nComparatively,  Medicis reported fiscal 2003 net revenues of $247.5 million with\nnet income of $63.5 million,  or $1.13 per diluted share, absent a $12.2 million\ntax-effected special charge reported during fiscal 2003 associated with research\nand development  collaborations.  Including the  tax-effected  special charge of\n$12.2 million  reported during fiscal 2003, the Company reported GAAP net income\nof $51.3 million, or $0.91 per diluted share for fiscal 2003.\n\nFourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2004 diluted per share amounts are calculated\nusing the "if-converted" method of accounting in accordance with GAAP due to the\noutstanding 2.5%  Convertible  Senior Notes meeting the criteria for conversion,\nregardless of whether the bondholders  actually convert their bonds into shares.\nFor  the  year  ended  June  30,  2004,  the  dilutive  shares  relative  to the\nconvertible   notes  do  not  impact  GAAP  earnings  per  share,  as  they  are\nanti-dilutive. Fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2003 diluted per share amounts\ndo not reflect the "if-converted" method, as the criteria for conversion had not\nbeen met.\n\n                                     (more)\n\n', u'\n\n"We are pleased to announce the  completion of the strongest  quarter and fiscal\nyear  in the  Company\'s  history,"  said  Jonah  Shacknai,  Chairman  and  Chief\nExecutive  Officer of  Medicis.  "Fiscal  2004 was another  noteworthy  year for\nMedicis, with several significant milestone achievements,  including exceptional\nsales growth through the launch of RESTYLANE(R),  exceeding $125 million in cash\nflow from  operations,  surpassing  $80 million in  revenues  for the first time\nduring one quarter,  and accumulating  over $1 billion in assets. We express our\ngratitude to the physicians and the  exceptional  Medicis team for their support\nas we continue our expansion  into the  aesthetics  market and remain focused on\nour commitment to increasing shareholder value in fiscal 2005."\n\nFiscal 2004 year-end net revenues  increased  approximately  23%, primarily as a\nresult of overall  growth in sales of  RESTYLANE(R),  DYNACIN(R),  LOPROX(R) and\nTRIAZ(R).  At the end of the fourth quarter,  the Company\'s core brands included\nDYNACIN(R),  LOPROX(R), OMNICEF(R),  PLEXION(R),  RESTYLANE(R) and TRIAZ(R). For\nfiscal 2004, core brands, including ORAPRED(R), represented approximately 87% of\ntotal  product  sales.  During fiscal 2004,  prescription  volume growth for the\nCompany\'s core brands, excluding RESTYLANE(R),  increased 15% and 13% in new and\ntotal  prescriptions,  respectively.  The  Company\'s  gross  profit  margin  was\napproximately 85% for the fiscal 2004 year-end.\n\nFor the fourth quarter fiscal 2004, cash flow from operations was $50.5 million,\ncompared  to  $16.0  million  for the  fourth  quarter  fiscal  2003,  or a 215%\nincrease. During fourth quarter fiscal 2004, selling, general and administrative\nexpenses  decreased  approximately  1 percentage  point as a percentage of sales\ncompared to fourth quarter fiscal 2003,  increasing  approximately 27% in fourth\nquarter  fiscal  2004 to $30.3  million,  compared  to $23.9  million for fourth\nquarter fiscal 2003.\n\nCash flow from operations for fiscal 2004 was $128.0 million,  compared to $84.7\nmillion for fiscal 2003, or a 51% increase.  Selling, general and administrative\nexpenses  for  fiscal  2004  increased  approximately  29%  to  $118.3  million,\nprimarily due to the  incremental  costs  incurred  with the product  launch and\nfirst U.S.  commercial  sales of  RESTYLANE(R),  which began on January 6, 2004.\nSuch incremental costs associated with the product launch included the hiring of\na dedicated aesthetics sales force, additional headquarters personnel to support\nsales force efforts, including product management, customer service and training\npersonnel,  expenses  associated with public relations,  physician  training and\ncontinuing medical education, and other administrative expenses.\n\nDuring fiscal 2004,  research and development  expense,  absent special charges,\nincreased  approximately 50% to $14.1 million for the year, primarily due to the\nadvancement of the Company\'s research and development pipeline. Depreciation and\namortization  expense  for  fiscal  2004  increased  approximately  66% to $16.8\nmillion,  primarily  due to the  amortization  of the  purchase  price  for  the\nexclusive rights to RESTYLANE(R) in the United States and Canada.\n\nThe Company\'s previously released fiscal year 2005 revenue and earnings guidance\nremains unchanged and is as follows:  fiscal year 2005 revenues of approximately\n$365 million and  earnings  per share  guidance of  approximately  $1.42;  first\nquarter  fiscal year 2005 (for the quarter  ending  September  30, 2004) revenue\nguidance  of  approximately  $85  million  and  earnings  per share  guidance of\napproximately  $0.29;  second  quarter  fiscal year 2005 (for the quarter ending\nDecember 31, 2004) revenue  guidance of  approximately  $89 million and earnings\nper share guidance of  approximately  $0.35;  third quarter fiscal 2005 (for the\nquarter ending March 31, 2005) revenue guidance of approximately $93 million and\nearnings per share guidance of  approximately  $0.36;  and fourth quarter fiscal\nyear  2005  (for  the  quarter  ending  June  30,  2005)  revenue   guidance  of\napproximately  $98  million and  earnings  per share  guidance of  approximately\n$0.42.

Also, there\nare a number of additional  important factors that could cause actual results to\ndiffer  materially from those  projected,  including the anticipated size of the\nmarkets,  the availability of product supply, the receipt of required regulatory\napprovals,  the ability to realize  anticipated  synergies  and  benefits of the\nQ-Med  transactions,  the  risks  and  uncertainties  normally  incident  to the\npharmaceutical industry, dependence on sales of key products, the uncertainty of\nfuture financial  results and fluctuations in operating  results,  dependence on\nMedicis\'  strategy  including the  uncertainty of license  payments and/or other\npayments  due  from  third  parties,  the  timing  and  success  of new  product\ndevelopment by Medicis or third  parties,  product  introductions,  the risks of\npending or future  litigation,  and other risks  described  from time to time in\nMedicis\' SEC filings including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nJune 30, 2003.  There can be no assurance as to when or if any of the holders of\nthe Notes will have the right to convert or if the Notes will be converted,  and\nwhat impact the increase in the number of shares outstanding will have on its\n\n                                     (more)\n', u"\n\nresults of  operations.
