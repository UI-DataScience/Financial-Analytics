Net income for the 2004 period\nreflects an income tax benefit of $1.4 million due to the June 2004 successful\ncompletion of an Internal Revenue Service examination related to the Company's\nSection 29 income tax credits for certain years. Net income for the 2004 period\nalso reflects a $0.6 million pre-tax loss on the early termination of debt. Per\nshare results are based on 12,854,000 and 12,626,000 diluted weighted average\nshares outstanding for the three-month periods ending July 31, 2004 and July 31,\n2003, respectively.\n\nNet sales in the three months ended July 31, 2004 fell 2% to $88.4 million from\n$90.2 million in the three months ended July 31, 2003. Comparable store sales\nduring the period were flat compared to the same year-ago period. Excluding air\nconditioners, which can represent a significant portion of the Company's fiscal\nsecond quarter sales, comparable store sales would have risen 4%. The Company\nreports sales performance quarterly and considers a store to be comparable after\nit has been open six full fiscal quarters. Comparable store sales figures do not\ninclude sales of extended service contracts.\n\n\n                                     -more-\n\n\n\n\n", u'\n\n\nREX Stores Reports Second Quarter Results, 9/2/04                         page 2\n\n\nDuring the three-month period ended July 31, 2004, REX purchased approximately\n420,400 shares of its common stock in open market transactions.
