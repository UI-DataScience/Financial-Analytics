The increase is primarily driven by lower interest expense as a\nresult of the Company\'s efforts to reduce outstanding debt levels.\n\n     Net sales for fiscal 2004 were approximately $843.4 million, a decline of\n$19.6 million or 2.3%, as compared to $863.0 million in fiscal 2003. A majority\nof the decline resulted from a decrease in non-branded product sales due to\ncontinued efforts to rationalize certain product offerings. In addition, the\nBirds Eye Voila! product line faced industry challenges last year which the\nCompany has actively addressed through a brand revitalization, including the\nintroduction of several reduced carbohydrate alternatives along with other new\nflavor offerings and reformulated varieties. Net sales within the core Birds Eye\nbranded frozen vegetable business have remained strong, experiencing 3% growth\nas compared to the prior year. The introduction of several value added vegetable\nitems led to this improvement.\n\n     Dennis M. Mullen, Birds Eye Foods Chairman, President, and Chief Executive\nOfficer comments, "Our industry has been and continues to be faced with\nchallenges, including increases in costs for our ingredients, commodities and\npackaging as well as health care costs." Mullen continues, "However, the\nimprovements we have made in our debt structure over the last two years have\nallowed us to show growth in net income. We continue to focus our efforts in\nfiscal 2005 on product innovation and other growth initiatives to bring to our\ncustomers and consumers healthy, high quality, value-added products."\n\n     Rochester-based Birds Eye Foods, with sales of approximately $1.0 billion\nannually, processes fruits and vegetables in 14 facilities across the country.\nFamiliar brands in the frozen aisle include Birds Eye, Birds Eye Voila!, Birds\nEye Simply Grillin\', Freshlike and McKenzie\'s. Other processed foods marketed by\nBirds Eye Foods include fillings and toppings (Comstock and Wilderness); chili\nand chili ingredients (Nalley and Brooks); salad dressings (Bernstein\'s and\nNalley) and snacks (Tim\'s and Snyder of Berlin). Birds Eye Foods also produces\nmany of these products for the store brands, food service and industrial\nmarkets.\n\nNOTE: In conjunction with this release, investors will have the opportunity to\nlisten to a conference call on Wednesday, September, 29, 2004, at 1 p.m. eastern\ntime over the Internet through PR Newswire\'s website.

In conjunction with this repayment, a\n     pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $4.0 million\n     was recorded. This amount reflects the payment of the $8.9 million call\n     premium and other transaction expenses less the elimination of the related\n     unamortized premium of $4.9 million.\n\n(c)  The Company has disposed of its Freshlike canned, Veg-All, popcorn, and\n     applesauce operations. The implementation of SFAS No. 144 resulted in the\n     classification and separate financial presentation of those businesses as\n     discontinued operations and are, therefore, excluded from continuing\n     operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n-----END PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE-----\n']
