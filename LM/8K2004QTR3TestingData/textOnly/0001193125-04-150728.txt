AND SUBSIDIARIES ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'NOTE 1 ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Operations and Accounting Policies ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The principal operations of Fisher Communications, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) are television and radio broadcasting. The Company also owns and\noperates Fisher Plaza, a digital communications hub facility that houses and serves an array of communications and media clients. As explained in Note 2, in 2003 the Company sold the remaining commercial properties held by its property subsidiary,\nand also sold its property management business; in 2002, the Company also sold certain commercial properties. The Company sold its flour milling and bakery supply distribution businesses during 2001. The Company conducts its business primarily in\nWashington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. A summary of significant accounting policies is as follows: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Principles of consolidation', u'. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Fisher Communications, Inc. and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries. Television and radio broadcasting are conducted through Fisher Broadcasting Company. Fisher Media Services Company was formed in 2001 to conduct other media operations, including Fisher Plaza, beginning in 2002. All material\nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Estimates', u'. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Television and radio broadcast licenses', u'. The Company\x92s broadcast\noperations are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission (the \x93FCC\x94) under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the \x93Communications Act\x94). The Communications Act empowers the FCC to regulate many\naspects of the broadcasting industry, including the granting and renewal of broadcast licenses. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Revenue recognition', u'. Television and radio revenue is recognized when the advertisement is broadcast. The Company may barter unsold advertising time\nfor products or services; barter transactions are reported at the estimated fair value of the product or service received. Barter revenue is reported when commercials are broadcast, and goods or services received are reported when received or used.\nRentals from real estate leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Revenue from production of content is recognized when a contracted production is available for distribution. Revenue from satellite transmission\nservices is recognized when the service is performed. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Short-term cash investments', u'. Short-term cash investments are comprised of repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Government securities held by major banks. The Company considers short-term cash investments that have remaining\nmaturities at date of purchase of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Marketable securities', u'. Marketable securities at December 31, 2003 consist of 3,002,376 shares of Safeco Corporation common stock, valued based on the closing per-share sale price on the specific-identification\nbasis as reported on the Nasdaq stock market. As of December 31, 2003, these shares represented 2.2% of the outstanding common stock of Safeco Corporation. Mr. William W. Krippaehne Jr., President, CEO and a Director of the Company, is a Director of\nSafeco. The Company has classified its investments as available-for-sale under applicable accounting standards, and those investments are reported at fair market value. Unrealized gains and losses are a separate component of stockholders\x92\nequity, net of any related tax effect. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'During 2003, certain other marketable securities were sold for total proceeds of $5,169,000; the Company recognized gains on such sales of $3,675,000, which\nare included in other income, net. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Concentration of credit\nrisk', u'. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily accounts receivable. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to the receivables are limited due to the large number of customers\nin the Company\x92s customer base and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. The Company does not generally require collateral or other security for its accounts receivable. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Television and radio broadcast rights', u'. Television and radio broadcast\nrights are recorded as assets when the license period begins and the programs are available for broadcast, at the gross amount of the related obligations. Costs incurred in connection with the purchase of programs to be broadcast within one year are\nclassified as current assets, while costs of those programs to be broadcast after one year are considered noncurrent. The costs are charged to operations over their estimated broadcast periods using either the straight-line method or in proportion\nto estimated revenue. Program obligations are classified as current or noncurrent in accordance with the payment terms of the license agreement. The Company periodically assesses impairment of broadcast rights on a program-by-program basis; any\nimpairment found is charged to operations in the period of the impairment. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Investments in equity investees', u'. Investments in equity investees represent investments in entities over which the Company does not have control, but has significant influence and owns 50% or less. Such\ninvestments are accounted for using the equity method (See Note 4). ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Goodwill and long-lived intangible assets', u'. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price of certain broadcast properties over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired and is accounted for under\nthe provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, \x93Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\x94 (\x93SFAS 142\x94). Under the provisions of SFAS 142 the Company ceased amortizing goodwill effective January 1, 2002, and\ntests goodwill at least annually, or whenever events indicate that an impairment may exist. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'As required by SFAS 142, the results for periods prior to adoption have not been restated. The following table reconciles the reported net loss and net loss per share to that which would have resulted for 2001 if\nSFAS\xa0142 had been adopted effective in 2001 (in thousands, except per-share amounts).

Replacements and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are charged as expense when incurred. Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost, net of related accumulated depreciation. Gains or losses\non dispositions of property, plant and equipment are included in other income, net, or in discontinued operations, based on the nature of the disposition. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Real estate taxes, interest expense, and certain other costs related to real estate projects constructed for lease to third parties are capitalized as a\ncost of such projects until the project, including major tenant improvements, is substantially completed. A project is generally considered to be substantially completed when a predetermined ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'occupancy level has been reached or the project has been available for occupancy for a period of one year. Costs, including depreciation, applicable to a\nproject are charged to expense based on the ratio of occupied space to total rentable space until the project is substantially completed, after which such costs are expensed as incurred. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'For financial reporting purposes, depreciation of plant and equipment is determined primarily by the straight-line method\nover the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Buildings and improvements', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'5\x9655\xa0years', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Machinery and equipment', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'3\x9625\xa0years', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Land improvements', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'10\x9655\xa0years', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Impairment of\nlong-lived assets', u'. Whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, the Company assesses the recoverability of intangible and long-lived assets by reviewing the performance of the underlying operations,\nin particular the operating cash flows (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of the operation. During 2003, the Company received a copy of an appraisal report for Fisher Plaza that had been prepared to meet certain\nrequirements under the Company\x92s borrowing agreements. The appraisal indicated a range of values that extended below the then-current net book value of Fisher Plaza; therefore, in accordance with accounting rules and the Company\x92s\npractices, the Company analyzed the estimated undiscounted cash flows for this long-lived asset and determined that there was no impairment because projected cash flows exceeded the net book value of Fisher Plaza. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Fair value of financial instruments', u'. The carrying amount of cash and\nshort-term cash investments, receivables, inventories, marketable securities, trade accounts payable, and broadcast rights payable approximate fair value due to their short maturities. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The fair value of notes payable and variable-rate long-term debt approximate the recorded amount based on borrowing rates\ncurrently available to the Company. At December 31, 2003, the fair value of the Company\x92s fixed-rate debt is estimated to be approximately $4,900,000 greater than the recorded amount, based on current borrowing rates. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'At December 31, 2003, the fair value of the Company\x92s variable forward\nsales transaction was a liability of $5,072,000, and the fair value of the Company\x92s interest rate swap agreement was a liability of $907,000 (See Note 7). ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Interest rate protection arrangement', u'. The Company utilizes an interest rate swap in the management of its variable rate exposure. The interest\nrate swap is held at fair value with the change in fair value being recorded in the statement of operations. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Advertising', u'. The Company expenses advertising costs at the time the advertising first takes place. Advertising expense was $4,343,000, $3,335,000,\nand $3,259,000 in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Income taxes', u'. Deferred income taxes are provided for all significant temporary differences in reporting for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Earnings per share', u'. Net income (loss) per share represents net income\n(loss) divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.

The Company has determined that the impairment test should be conducted at the operating\nsegment level, which, with respect to the broadcast operations, requires separate assessment of each of the Company\x92s television and radio station groups. The Company determines fair value with the assistance of outside consultants; the\nvaluation methodologies include an analysis of market transactions for comparable businesses, discounted cash flows, and a review of the underlying assets of the reporting unit. As a result of the transitional impairment assessment upon adoption of\nSFAS 142 in 2002, the Company determined that impairment existed. Completion of the second step of the transitional impairment test resulted in a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $99,035,000 related to five television reporting units and a\nrelated tax benefit of $34,662,000 (as the aforementioned goodwill was deductible for tax purposes).

', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'On March 21, 2002 the Company\x92s media services subsidiary entered into a\nthree-year senior secured credit facility (the \x93Media Facility\x94) with two banks in the principal amount of $60,000,000 to fund partial payment of the unsecured revolving line of credit. The Media Facility is collateralized by a first deed\nof trust on the Fisher Plaza property; Fisher Plaza had a carrying amount of $123,000,000 as of December 31, 2003. The Media Facility is governed by a credit agreement that provides that borrowings will bear interest at variable rates based, at the\nmedia services subsidiary\x92s option, on the LIBOR rate plus a maximum margin of 450 basis points, or the prime rate plus a maximum margin of 325 basis points. The credit agreement places limitations on various aspects of the Company\x92s\noperations (including the payment of dividends and limitations on capital expenditures), requires compliance with certain financial ratios, and requires prepayment upon the occurrence of certain events including, but not limited to, certain\ndispositions of property and issuance of debt or equity securities. As a result of certain property sales by the real estate subsidiary in 2002 and 2003, the Company paid a total of $6,200,000 on the Media Facility in the fourth quarter of 2002 and\nearly 2003 and a total of ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'$14,700,000 on the Media Facility in the fourth quarter of 2003.

', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'On March 21, 2002 the\nCompany entered into a variable forward sales transaction (the \x93Forward Transaction\x94) with a financial institution. The Company\x92s obligations under the Forward Transaction are collateralized by 3,000,000 shares of Safeco Corporation\ncommon stock owned by the Company. A portion of the Forward Transaction is considered a derivative and, as such, the Company periodically measures its fair value and recognizes the derivative as an asset or a liability. The change in the fair value\nof the derivative is recorded in the statement of operations. The Company may in the future designate the Forward Transaction as a hedge and, accordingly, the change in fair value would be recorded in the statement of operations or in other\ncomprehensive income, depending on its effectiveness. The Company may borrow up to $70,000,000 under the Forward Transaction. Proceeds from the Forward Transaction were used to repay prior debt, and have been used to finance construction of the\nFisher Plaza project, and for general corporate purposes. The Forward Transaction matures in five separate six-month intervals beginning March 15, 2005 through March 15, 2007. The amount due at each maturity date is determined based on the market\nvalue of Safeco common stock on such maturity date. Although the Company has the option of settling the amount due in cash, or by delivery of shares of Safeco common stock, the Company currently intends to settle in cash rather than by delivery of\nshares. The Company may prepay amounts due in connection with the Forward Transaction. During the term of the Forward Transaction, the Company will continue to receive dividends paid by Safeco; however, any increase in the dividend amount above the\nrate as of the date of the Forward Transaction must be paid to the financial institution that is a party to the Forward Transaction. At December 31, 2003 the derivative portion of the Forward Transaction had a fair market value resulting in a\nliability of $5,072,000, compared to an asset of $5,227,000 as of December 31, 2002; this $10,299,000 reduction in value during 2003 is included in net loss on derivative instruments in the accompanying financial statements. The fair value of the\nderivative is included in other long-term liabilities as of December 31, 2003, and in other long-term assets as of December 31, 2002 in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2003, $54,222,000 was outstanding under the\nForward Transaction, including accrued interest amounting to $7,303,000. The Forward Transaction does not specify an interest rate; rather, amounts are borrowed at a discount, and the discount is amortized as interest expense over the life of the\nloan. As of December 31, 2003, the face value of borrowings under the Forward Transaction totaled $62,546,000. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Also on March 21, 2002, the Company\x92s broadcasting subsidiary entered into an eight-year credit facility (the \x93Broadcast Facility\x94) with a\ngroup of banks in the amount of $150,000,000, of which $131,000,000 was borrowed at closing, to fund payment of the senior credit facility, repayment of other borrowings, and for general corporate purposes. The Broadcast Facility is collateralized\nby a first priority lien on: (i) the broadcasting subsidiary\x92s capital stock, (ii) all equity interests in direct and indirect subsidiaries of the broadcast subsidiary, and (iii) all tangible and intangible assets of the broadcasting subsidiary\nand its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Broadcast Facility places limitations on various aspects of the broadcast subsidiary\x92s operations (including the payment of dividends to the Company), requires compliance with certain financial\nratios, and requires prepayment upon the occurrence of certain events including, but not limited to, certain asset dispositions. As a result of the Company\x92s sale of its Georgia television stations and Portland radio stations, the Company paid\n$72,900,000 on the Broadcasting Facility in the fourth quarter of 2003. The Company was in compliance with its covenants, as amended, at December 31, 2003. The most recent amendment was dated February 20, 2004, effective December 31, 2003.

CONTAINED IN PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM\n', u'\n', u'M.D.& A. contained in Preliminary Offering Memorandum', u'\n', u'Exhibit 99.2 ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'MANAGEMENT\x92S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The following discussion is intended to provide an analysis of significant\ntrends, if any, and material changes in our financial condition and operating results of our business units during the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2004, compared with the corresponding periods in 2003, and for the fiscal years ended\nDecember 31, 2001 through December 31, 2003. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Overview ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We are an integrated media company. We operate two businesses: TV and radio broadcasting and media services. We own and\noperate nine network-affiliated television stations and 27 radio stations. We also own a 50% interest in a company that owns a tenth television station. Our television and radio stations are located in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana. Within\nour media services business, we own and operate Fisher Plaza, a communications facility located near downtown Seattle that serves as the home for our corporate offices, including our Seattle television and radio stations, and also houses a variety\nof companies, including media and communications companies. We also own approximately 3.0 million shares of common stock of Safeco Corporation, a publicly traded insurance and financial services company. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our broadcasting operations receive revenues from the sale of local, regional\nand national advertising and, to a much lesser extent, from network compensation, satellite and fiber transmission services, tower rental and commercial production activities. Our operating results are therefore sensitive to broad economic trends\nthat affect the broadcasting industry in general, as well as local and regional trends, such as those in the Northwest economy. The advertising revenue of our stations is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year, due in part\nto increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to and including the holiday season. In addition, advertising revenue is generally higher during national election years due to spending by political\ncandidates. This political spending typically is heaviest during the fourth quarter. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our television revenues are significantly affected by network affiliation and the success of programming offered by those networks. Our two largest television stations, representing approximately three-fourths of our\ntelevision revenues, are affiliated with ABC, and the remaining eight television stations (including 50%-owned KPIC TV) are affiliated with CBS. Our broadcasting operations are subject to competitive pressures from traditional broadcasting sources,\nas well as from alternative methods of delivering information and entertainment, and these pressures may cause fluctuations in operating results. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In May 2002, we entered into a radio rights agreement (the \x93Rights Agreement\x94) to broadcast Seattle Mariners baseball games on KOMO AM for the\n2003 through 2008 baseball seasons. The Rights Agreement has led to significantly increased overall revenues at our Seattle radio operations, as well as significantly increased programming, selling, promotional and other costs, as we seek to elevate\nthe position of our Seattle radio operations in the Seattle market. The impact of the Rights Agreement is greater during periods that include the broadcast of Mariners baseball games; therefore, the impact on the first quarter of 2004 is less than\nwhat is expected for the second and third quarters of the calendar year. We also changed to an all-news format for KOMO AM in September 2002. These changes have led to improved ratings for KOMO AM in the Seattle market, and we expect that these\ninvestments will lead to improved operating performance for our Seattle radio ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'stations. Nevertheless, the success of this programming is dependent on factors beyond our control, such as the competitiveness of the Seattle Mariners and\nthe successful marketing of the team. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In addition to our\nbroadcasting operations, we own and operate Fisher Plaza and we lease space to other companies that are attracted by the property location and the infrastructure provided at this facility. Fisher Plaza was first opened for occupancy in May 2000 and\nthe second phase of the project was opened for occupancy in the summer of 2003. As of June 30, 2004, approximately 82% of Fisher Plaza was occupied or committed for occupancy (41% was occupied by Fisher entities), compared to 70% occupied or\ncommitted for occupancy at December 31, 2003. Revenues and operating income from Fisher Plaza are dependent upon the general economic climate, the Seattle economic climate, the outlook of the telecommunications and technology sectors and real estate\nconditions, including the availability of space in other competing properties. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Management focuses on key metrics from operational data within our broadcasting and Fisher Plaza operations. Information on significant trends is provided in the section entitled \x93Consolidated Results of\nOperations.\x94 ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Consolidated Results of Operations ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We report financial data for three reportable segments: television, radio\nand Fisher Plaza. The television reportable segment includes the operations of our nine network-affiliated wholly owned television stations, and a tenth television station 50% owned by us. The radio reportable segment includes the operations of our\n27 radio stations. Corporate expenses of the broadcasting business unit are allocated to the television and radio reportable segments based on a ratio that approximates historic revenue and operating expenses of the segments. The Fisher Plaza\nreportable segment consists of the operations of Fisher Plaza. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We formerly reported financial data for a remaining \x93all other\x94 category. The operations of Fisher Pathways, Inc., a provider of satellite transmission services, as well as Fisher Media Services Company\x92s corporate expenses,\nwere included in this \x93all other\x94 category. Beginning in the first quarter of 2004, we began reporting the operations of Fisher Pathways, Inc. in the television reportable segment, consistent with changes in the financial and operational\noversight of those operations. Also beginning in the first quarter of 2004, we began reporting Fisher Media Services Company\x92s corporate expenses in the Fisher Plaza reportable segment, consistent with that entity\x92s sole operational focus.\nPrior-period segment data has been revised to conform to the 2004 presentation.

u'Revenue ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Each of our television broadcasting groups reported increased revenues in the first six months of 2004, as compared to the\nsame period of 2003. These increases were primarily attributable to higher political advertising, since 2004 is a national election year. The overall increase was also due to increased local advertising revenue in the first six months of 2004, as\ncompared to the first six months of 2003, as we have focused significant efforts on improving our local advertising success. The overall increase in revenue was offset, in part, by decreased national non-political advertising at our ABC-affiliated\nstations. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our Seattle and Portland total television revenues\nincreased 3.6% and 9.9%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2004, as compared to the second quarter of 2003. Revenue from our remaining television stations increased by 13.2% in the second quarter of 2004, as compared to the second quarter of\n2003. These increases were primarily attributable to higher political advertising. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Based on information published by Miller, Kaplan, Arase & Co., LLP (Miller Kaplan), total spot revenue for the overall Seattle television market increased 7.9% in the first six months of 2004, as compared to the\nsame period of 2003, and total spot revenue for the overall Portland television market increased 12.0% over these same periods. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Revenue at our Seattle and Portland television stations experienced spot revenue increases of 3.4% and 8.7%, respectively, in the first half of 2004, as\ncompared to the first half of 2003. Spot revenue consists of local advertising, which is sold by a station\x92s staff directly to local accounts as well as national advertising sold through third-party agencies. We believe that the weak\nperformance of ABC programming contributes to lower-than-market performance at these stations. Our Seattle and Portland total television revenues increased 4.9% and 7.7%, respectively, in the first six months of 2004, as compared to the first six\nmonths of 2003, due primarily to increased political advertising. Revenue from our remaining television stations increased by 13.7% in the first half of 2004, as compared to the first half of 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our radio operations showed strong revenue growth in the first six months of\n2004, compared to the first six months of 2003, primarily as a result of KOMO AM\x92s improved performance in the Seattle market. Excluding revenues specifically attributable to our agreement with the Seattle Mariners to broadcast baseball games\non radio, KOMO AM\x92s revenues increased 78% in the first half of 2004, compared to the first half of 2003. We attribute the increase to the synergistic effect of the Seattle Mariners programming, as well as the conversion of KOMO AM to an\nall-news format in September 2002. Miller Kaplan (which excludes sports programming) reported that radio revenues, for the Seattle market grew 2.1% during the first six months of 2004, as compared to the same period of 2003. Our total Seattle radio\nrevenue increased 11.6% in the first six months of 2004, as compared to the first six months of 2003. Revenue from our Seattle radio operations comprised approximately 75% of our total radio revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2004. ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our total Seattle radio revenue increased 9.8% in the second quarter of\n2004 as compared to the second quarter of 2003. Again, we attribute the increase primarily to the synergistic effect of the Seattle Mariners programming, as well as our converting KOMO AM to an all-news format in September 2002. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Fisher Plaza first opened in May of 2000, and the second phase of the project\nwas open for occupancy in the summer of 2003. The decrease in revenue in the first six months of 2004, as compared to the first six months of 2003, was due to a significant penalty paid by a tenant during the first quarter of 2003 for early\ntermination of a lease. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'The slight decrease in revenue in the second quarter of 2004, as compared to the same quarter of 2003,\nwas due primarily to slightly lower lease renewal rates granted to a particular tenant over a longer lease term. The Seattle-area commercial real estate market continues to be soft, which may delay our ability to reach full occupancy at Fisher\nPlaza. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Cost of services sold ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The cost of services sold consists primarily of costs to acquire, produce,\nand promote broadcast programming for the television and radio segments, and costs to operate Fisher Plaza. Many of these costs are relatively fixed in nature and do not necessarily vary on a proportional basis with revenue. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The decrease in the television segment cost of services sold in the three-\nand six-month periods ended June\xa030, 2004, as compared to the same periods of 2003, was primarily the result of lower programming and syndication costs. The decrease was offset somewhat by increased news department expenses. Programming\nexpenses in the television segment are expected to increase in the fall of 2004 as a result of expected new programming, including the addition of the Jane Pauley Show, to be added on certain of our television stations. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Lower cost of services sold at our radio segment in the three months and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2004, as compared to the same periods in 2003, were primarily attributable to timing differences relating to expensing of the Seattle Mariners baseball broadcast rights (with amortization based on proportional revenue as a\npercentage of total projected baseball season revenue) as well as lower programming costs due to a change in syndicated programming at KVI AM in Seattle. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The decrease in cost of services sold at Fisher Plaza in the three months and six months ended June 30, 2004, as compared to the same 2003 periods, was\nprimarily attributable to higher tenant occupancy, thereby providing for overall higher reimbursement of operating costs. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The corporate and eliminations category consists primarily of the reclassification and elimination of certain operating expenses between operating\nsegments; for example, KOMO TV and our Seattle radio recognize facilities-related expenses as general and administrative, while Fisher Plaza records the reimbursement of these expenses as a reduction of cost of services sold. The increases in the\nsecond quarter and first half of 2004, as compared to the second quarter and first half of 2003, were due primarily to intersegment facilities-related expenses. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Selling expenses ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The increases in selling expenses in the television and radio segments in the six month period ended June\xa030, 2004, as compared to the same six\nmonths of 2003, were due primarily to increased sales commissions on higher revenue levels. The increases in selling expenses in the television and radio segments in the three-month period ended June 30, 2004, as compared to the three-month period\nended June 30, 2003, were due primarily to increased promotions as well as increased sales commissions on higher revenue levels. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Increased selling expenses at Fisher Plaza for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2004, as compared to the same periods of 2003, were due\nprimarily to greater 2004 efforts to market Fisher Plaza, including the second phase of the facility which was first available for occupancy in the summer of 2003. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'General and administrative expenses ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The television and radio segments had lower general and administrative expenses in the three- and six-month periods ended\nJune 30, 2004, as compared to the same periods of 2003, due primarily to cost control measures that included the suspension of our 401(k) plan matching contributions. These savings were offset somewhat in the first quarter of 2004 as a result of\nemployee termination expenses totaling approximately $510,000. In the first quarter of 2004, as a result of operational decisions and cost control measures, we terminated the employment of 23 people in our broadcast operations. We anticipate annual\nsavings among various operating categories of approximately $1.5 million from this action. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The corporate group incurred lower expenses in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2004, as compared to the same periods of 2003, primarily as a result of reduced retention accruals, the absence of certain\npension-related expenses that were recognized in the first half of 2003 in connection with a pension plan settled in the first quarter of 2003, a three-year charitable contribution commitment that resulted in a quarterly expense of $250,000 that\nconcluded in 2003, as well as lower legal expenses. These decreases were offset in part by costs associated with additional finance and accounting personnel, as well as consulting and professional fees relating to increased regulatory requirements\nunder the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We expect to see higher corporate general and administrative expenses in the remainder of 2004, due in large part to increasing costs related to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, in the second\nquarter of 2004, we recognized expenses totaling $471,000 relating to the early retirement of our former chief financial officer. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Depreciation ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Depreciation for the television segment declined in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2004, as compared to the same periods of 2003, as a\nresult of generally reduced capital spending over the past few years. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The increase in depreciation in the Fisher Plaza segment in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2004, as compared to the same periods of 2003, was primarily due to commencing depreciation on the second building of the facility\nin July 2003 when the building was placed in service. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Net gain (loss) on\nderivative instruments ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'On March 21, 2002, we entered into\na forward sales transaction with a financial institution. As of December\xa031, 2003, our obligations under the forward sales transaction were collateralized by 3.0 million shares of Safeco Corporation common stock owned by us. A portion of the\nforward sales transaction is considered a derivative and, as such, we periodically measure its fair value and recognize the derivative as an asset or a liability. The change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in the statement of\noperations. The value of the forward sales transaction can change significantly, based primarily on changes in the value of Safeco Corporation common stock, changes in underlying assumptions concerning the volatility of Safeco Corporation common\nstock, and changes in interest rates. See \x93Description of Certain Indebtedness\x94 for additional details about the forward sales transaction. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'On April 28, 2004, we terminated one tranche of the forward sales transaction with a maturity date of March\xa015, 2007. In connection with the\ntermination, we paid a termination fee of $2.5 million which consisted of losses recorded in previous periods of $2.1 million and an additional loss of $436,000 recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2004. As a result of this termination, the latest\nmaturity under the forward sales transaction is October 10, 2006, the maximum amount available for borrowing under the forward sales transaction has been reduced by approximately $3.5 million, and the number of shares of Safeco Corporation common\nstock we own which are collateral for the forward sales transaction was reduced from 3.0 million to 2.6 million shares. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'In connection with borrowings for our broadcasting operations, the broadcasting subsidiary entered into\nan interest rate swap agreement in March 2002 with respect to a portion of the floating rate debt outstanding under these borrowings, fixing the interest rate at 6.87% plus a margin based on the broadcasting subsidiary\x92s ratio of consolidated\nfunded debt to consolidated EBITDA. The change in value of the swap agreement was recorded in the statement of operations. The interest rate swap expired in March 2004; therefore, the interest rate on these borrowings is no longer at a fixed rate.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Net loss on derivative instruments in the six-month period\nended June 30, 2004 consisted of losses resulting from changes in fair value of the forward sales transaction derivative amounting to $11.5 million, offset in part by a gain from changes in fair value of the swap agreement amounting to $907,000. The\nloss on the forward sales transaction was primarily attributable to the increased value of Safeco Corporation common stock during the six-month period ended June 30, 2004. We recorded a $15.2 million pre-tax increase in value of its marketable\nsecurities during the six-month period ended June 30, 2004, and that increase is reflected, after tax effects, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Net gain on derivative instruments in the six-month period ended June 30, 2003 included losses resulting from changes in\nfair value of the forward sales transaction amounting to $1.1 million, and gain from changes in fair value of the swap agreement amounting to $1.5 million.

The loss on the forward sales transaction was primarily attributable to the increased value of Safeco Corporation common stock during the second quarter of 2004. We recorded a $2.6 million pre-tax increase in\nvalue of its marketable securities during the second quarter of 2004, and that increase is reflected, after tax effects, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

The decrease in the\nfirst six months of 2004, in comparison to the first six months of 2003, was due primarily to gains on the sales of marketable securities amounting to $3.7 million in the first quarter of 2003.

', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The provision (benefit) for federal and state income taxes ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The provision (benefit) for federal and state income taxes varies directly with pre-tax income. The effective tax rate generally varies from the statutory rate primarily due to a deduction for dividends received,\noffset by the ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'impact of state income taxes. In the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2004, the tax rate included the effect of a revision of $377,000 in our\nvaluation allowances established for state deferred tax assets. The revision had the effect of substantially lowering the benefit for federal and state income taxes presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, and decreased the\neffective tax rate by 24.3% and 2.2% in the three and six months ended June 30, 2004, respectively. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Other comprehensive income (loss) ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Other comprehensive income (loss) includes unrealized gain or loss on our marketable securities, unrealized gain on marketable securities reclassified to operations, and adjustments to reflect minimum pension\nliabilities. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'During the six-month period ended June 30, 2004,\nthe value of the marketable securities increased $9.9 million, net of tax. As of June 30, 2004, marketable securities consisted of 3.0 million shares of Safeco Corporation. The per-share market price of Safeco Corporation common stock was $44.00 at\nJune 30, 2004, and $38.93 at December 31, 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'During the\nsix-month period ended June 30, 2003, the value of the marketable securities increased $1.2 million, net of tax. As of June 30, 2003, marketable securities consisted of 3.0 million shares of Safeco Corporation. The per-share market price of Safeco\nCorporation common stock was $35.29 at June 30, 2003, and $34.67 at December 31, 2002. In the first quarter of 2003, we reclassified $2.0 million after-tax gain to operations upon the sale of certain marketable securities. During the first quarter\nof 2003, we also recorded changes in our additional minimum pension liability amounting to $410,000, net of income taxes, in connection with one of our defined benefit pension plans that was settled in 2003.

', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Comparison of\nFiscal Years Ended December 31, 2003, December 31, 2002 and December\xa031, 2001 ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Revenue ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Overall\ntelevision net revenue was lower by $1.4 million in 2003, as compared to 2002. The decrease was primarily attributable to overall lower political advertising, particular in our Oregon markets, as well as lower national advertising revenue primarily\nat our two ABC-affiliated stations. Our two largest television stations, KOMO TV in Seattle and KATU in Portland, are affiliated with ABC. The overall decrease was offset somewhat by improved local advertising revenue in almost all of our operating\nunits, as well as improved national advertising at most of our CBS-affiliated small-market stations. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Based on information published by Miller Kaplan, revenue for the overall Seattle television market increased 2.2% during 2003, as compared to 2002, and\nrevenue for the overall Portland television market decreased 3.2%. Our Seattle and Portland television stations experienced revenue declines of 0.6% and 3.2%, respectively, during the year. We believe that the weak performance of ABC continues to\ncontribute to lower revenues at these stations. All of our smaller-market CBS-affiliated television operations reported increased revenue in 2003, as compared to 2002. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Overall television net revenue declined during 2002, compared with 2001, due primarily to a weak economy in the Northwest\nand relatively weak performance by ABC network programming. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Based on information published by Miller Kaplan, revenue for the overall Seattle television market\ndeclined 3% during 2002, as compared to 2001, and revenue for the overall Portland television market increased 10%. Our Seattle and Portland television stations experienced revenue declines of 14% and 1%, respectively, during the year. We believe\nthat the performance of ABC and coverage of the Winter Olympic Games on a competing network were contributing factors. We also believe that KOMO TV in Seattle was impacted by the popularity of the Seattle Mariners baseball team, whose games are\nbroadcast on a competing television station. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our radio\noperations showed strong revenue growth in 2003, compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of our agreement with the Seattle Mariners to broadcast its baseball games exclusively, beginning with the 2003 season. Miller Kaplan reported that\nradio revenues for the Seattle market, excluding sports programming, grew less than 1.0% during 2003. Our small-market radio stations in Eastern Washington and Montana also experienced strong growth in local and national advertising, and increased\nnet revenue by 8.0% during the year, due in part to operations under three new radio licenses in Montana. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our radio operations reported mixed revenue results during 2002. Revenues for our Seattle radio operations declined 11.7% during the year as compared to\n2001 due, in part, to a decline in ratings. Miller Kaplan reported that radio revenues for the Seattle market declined 2%. Revenue at our small-market radio stations in Eastern Washington and Montana increased 8% in 2002, compared with 2001, due in\npart to operations under two new radio licenses in Montana. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The increase in revenue in the Fisher Plaza segment over the past two years is due to increasing occupancy levels by third-party tenants; however, the increase in 2003 revenue, as compared with 2002, is primarily due to a $1.4 million\npenalty paid by a tenant during the first quarter of 2003 for early termination of leases. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Cost of services sold ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The overall increase in cost of services sold in 2003, in comparison to 2002, is the result of higher expenses in the radio segment relating to KOMO AM\x92s agreement to broadcast Seattle Mariners baseball games, as well as a September\n2002 change to an all-news format at KOMO AM. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The decrease in\nthe television segment cost of services sold in 2003, as compared to 2002, was primarily the result of lower programming and syndication costs as we changed the line-up for certain key syndicated programming and renegotiated contracts for certain\nother programs at lower overall rates. The overall decrease was partially offset by increased promotional activities and certain news-based expenses. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The overall increase in cost of services sold for the radio segment in 2003 was the result of higher expenses in the radio segment relating to KOMO\nAM\x92s agreement to broadcast Seattle Mariners baseball games, as well as a September 2002 change to an all-news format at KOMO AM. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Emphasis on expense control at the television and radio segments resulted in a reduction in operating expenses in both television and radio segments in\n2002, compared with 2001. The largest declines were in salaries and related expenses due to staff reduction, cost of syndicated and sports programs, and promotion expense. Some expense reductions in the radio segment were partially offset by\nincreases relating to the programming changes at KOMO AM in the fall of 2002. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Lower 2001 operating expenses in the Fisher Plaza segment were largely attributable to increasing costs as Fisher Plaza became an operating facility. Cost of services sold was also lower in 2001 due to deferral of\ncertain costs during the year as the first building of the project was in the development stage (see Note 1 to the ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Consolidated Financial Statements for our accounting policy regarding real estate development costs). Certain costs were also deferred relating to the second\nbuilding of the project. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Selling expenses ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The increase in selling expenses in the television segment in 2003, as\ncompared to 2002, is due primarily to increased consulting costs relating to increasing our revenue base, increased expenses relating to computer applications and services, and certain increases in salaries and commissions. The decrease in selling\nexpenses at the television segment in 2002, compared with 2001, is primarily due to a reduction in salaries and other selling expenses as part of efforts to control expenses. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Selling expenses increased in our radio segment in 2003, as compared to 2002, due primarily to costs associated with the\nMariners baseball contract on KOMO AM. These increased costs include merchandising, staff salaries, commissions, and meals and entertainment expenses. The overall increase in 2003 was also attributable to expenses associated with a joint sales\nagreement that became effective in March 2002 but that was in place for all of 2003. Selling expenses at the radio segment increased in 2002, as compared to 2001, as costs incurred at our Seattle radio operations in connection with the joint sales\nagreement, and additional sales personnel related to the Rights Agreement to broadcast Seattle Mariners baseball games on KOMO AM, more than offset savings resulting from emphasis on expense control and lower commissions to sales personnel due to\nreduced revenue. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We began separately identifying selling\nexpenses for Fisher Plaza in 2003. Previously, such expenses consisted primarily of fixed personnel expenses that were not allocated to Fisher Plaza. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'General and administrative expenses ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The television and radio segments had lower general and administrative expenses in 2003, as compared to 2002, due to lower expenses associated with our\nsupplemental retirement plan, continued cost-control efforts including savings in certain employee benefit areas, and reductions in certain support and facilities costs allocated to these segments. These reductions were offset in part by increased\ninsurance and incentive compensation costs. Specific to Seattle radio operations, the decrease in 2003 also was due to a $600,000 charge taken in 2002 as a result of relocating our Seattle radio operations. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The television and radio segments experienced higher costs of medical and\nother employee benefits, insurance and professional fees during 2002, as compared to 2001. The radio segment also incurred a charge amounting to approximately $600,000 in connection with a change in location of the Seattle radio operations during\n2002, compared with 2001. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In the Fisher Plaza segment, the\nincrease in general and administrative expenses in 2002, as compared to 2001, was primarily attributable to increased personnel and related costs at Fisher Media Services\x92 corporate function related primarily to marketing and administration for\nFisher Plaza. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The corporate group incurred higher expenses in\n2003, as compared to 2002, primarily as a result of retention payments (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and severance expenses (related to restructuring and streamlining activities), together accounting for $2.7 million, as\nwell as increased legal and consulting expenses relating to evaluation of strategic alternatives and corporate projects. Corporate general and administrative expenses in 2004 are expected to include additional finance personnel, consulting, and\nprofessional fees relating to increased regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'corporate group incurred lower general and administrative expenses in certain categories in 2002 primarily as a result of severance and outplacement costs\nfrom staff reductions in 2001 that did not recur in 2002. These decreases were offset by increases in other categories, including insurance and pension expense. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Depreciation and amortization ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Depreciation for the television segment declined in 2003, as compared to 2002, as a result of reduced capital spending over the past two years.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The decline in depreciation and amortization in the television\nsegment for 2002, compared with 2001, is primarily due to a new accounting standard that required discontinuation of goodwill amortization beginning January 1, 2002. Goodwill amortization amounted to $3.9 million during 2001. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Depreciation for the radio segment declined in 2003 as a result of reduced\ncapital spending over the past two years. The increase in depreciation and amortization in the radio segment for 2002, compared with 2001, was primarily due to a change in location of our Seattle radio operations, which resulted in accelerating\ndepreciation on certain items at the prior facility. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The\nincrease in depreciation in the Fisher Plaza segment in 2003, as compared to 2002, is primarily due to commencing depreciation on the second building of the facility in July 2003 when the building was placed in service and recording a full year of\ndepreciation in 2003 for web publishing software that was acquired in 2002. Fisher Plaza was first placed in service in mid-2000, and depreciation on an additional portion of the project began during the second half of 2001 when the first phase was\nconsidered substantially complete. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2002 as compared to 2001 was therefore due to the timing of our commencing depreciation on Fisher Plaza. In addition, the 2002 increase is due to\ndepreciation of web publishing software placed in service in 2002 by the Media Services corporate group. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Net gain (loss) on derivative instruments ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We had no derivative gain or loss for 2001. Net loss on derivative instruments in 2003 consisted of unrealized loss resulting from changes in fair value of the forward sales transaction derivative amounting to $10.3\nmillion, offset in part by an unrealized gain from changes in fair value of the swap agreement amounting to $3.4 million in 2002 (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Net gain on derivative instruments in 2002 includes unrealized gain resulting from changes in fair value of the forward\nsales transaction amounting to $5.2 million, unrealized loss from changes in fair value of the swap agreement amounting to $959,000, and a realized loss amounting to $2.6 million from termination, in March 2002, of a previous interest rate swap\nagreement. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Loss from extinguishment of long-term debt ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'As a result of significant reductions in our long-term debt during the\nfourth quarter of 2003, we wrote off deferred loan costs totaling $2.2 million. We repaid certain loans in March 2002 and, as a result, recognized deferred loan costs amounting to $3.3 million in 2002. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Other income, net ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Other income, net, includes dividends received on marketable securities and, to a lesser extent, interest and miscellaneous income. The increase in 2003,\nas compared to 2002, was due primarily to a gain on the sale of marketable securities amounting to $3.7 million in 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Interest expense, net ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Interest expense includes interest on borrowed funds, amortization of loan fees, and net payments under the swap agreement. In accordance with Emerging\nIssues Task Force Issue No. 87-24, \x93Allocation of Interest to Discontinued Operations,\x94 interest expense relating to debt that was required to be repaid from the net proceeds from certain sales has been reclassified to discontinued\noperations (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The increase in 2003 interest, as compared to 2002, was due primarily to increased fees and expenses associated with the swap agreement, as well as lower amounts capitalized due to\nthe completion of Fisher Plaza. The increase in 2002 interest expense, compared with 2001, was attributable to higher amounts borrowed during 2002, partially offset by lower interest rates. Interest attributable to construction costs of Fisher Plaza\nand other significant capital projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the related project until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Interest capitalized during 2003, 2002, and 2001 amounted to $2.0 million,\n$2.4 million, and $1.8 million, respectively. As a result of significant reductions in our debt balances in 2003, we anticipate lower interest expense in 2004. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Provision (benefit) for federal and state income taxes ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The provision for federal and state income taxes varies directly with pre-tax income. Consequently, the increase in benefit for federal and state income\ntaxes was primarily due to our increased losses for each of 2003, 2002 and 2001. The tax benefit from continuing operations in 2003 was offset by tax provisions in discontinued operations resulting primarily from gains on sales of assets. The tax\nbenefits in 2002 and 2001 primarily reflect our ability to utilize net operating loss carrybacks. The effective tax rate varies from the statutory rate primarily due to a deduction for dividends received, the impact of state income taxes, and, in\n2003 and 2002, revision of estimates of contingent tax liabilities. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of income tax ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, \x93Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\x94 SFAS 142 requires the Company to test goodwill and intangible\nassets for impairment upon adoption and to test goodwill at least annually, or whenever events indicate that an impairment may exist. The Company has determined that the impairment test should be conducted at the operating segment level, which, with\nrespect to the broadcast operations, consists and requires separate assessment, of each of the Company\x92s television and radio station groups. The Company determines fair value with the assistance of outside consultants; the valuation\nmethodologies include an analysis of market transactions for comparable businesses, discounted cash flows, and a review of the underlying assets of the reporting unit. As a result of the impairment assessment for 2002, the Company determined that\nimpairment existed. Completion of the second step of the transitional impairment test resulted in a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $99.0 million related to five television reporting units and a related tax benefit of $34.7 million (as the\naforementioned goodwill was deductible for tax purposes). ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'As\nrequired by the transition provisions of SFAS 142, the net loss of $64.4 million resulting from the transitional impairment test was recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2002. The required annual impairment tests were performed in the fourth\nquarter of 2003 and 2002, resulting in no further impairment. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Liquidity and\nCapital Resources ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'As of June 30, 2004, we presented $45.1\nmillion of long-term debt as current liabilities because these amounts are due in the first quarter of 2005; therefore, we had negative working capital of $8,902,000 as of June\xa030, 2004. Our current assets as of the end of the quarter included\ncash and cash equivalents totaling $10,705,000. We intend to finance working capital, debt service, capital expenditures, and dividend requirements, if any, primarily through operating activities. However, we will consider using available credit\nfacilities to fund significant development activities. At the closing of this offering we expect to be able to borrow up to $20.0 million under our proposed new senior credit facility. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Net cash used in operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2004 was $7.6 million, compared to cash provided\nby operations of $309,000 in the six months ended June 30, 2003. Net cash used in operating activities consists of our net income or loss, increased by non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, net (gain) loss on derivative\ninstruments, and adjusted by changes in operating assets and liabilities. In the first six months of 2004, we made significant tax payments relating to our gains on sale transactions in 2003; these payments represented a significant portion of the\ncash used in operating activities during the six-month period ended June 30, 2004 and a key reason for the increase in borrowings during the period. Net cash used in investing activities during the period was $1.4 million, to purchase property,\nplant and equipment. In the six-month period ended June 30, 2003, we purchased $5.8 million of property, plant and equipment and purchased a radio station license for $467,000; we also received $3.2 million from the collection of notes receivable,\nreceived $5.2 million in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, and had $12.8 million cash relating to the Fisher Plaza project become unrestricted. Broadcasting is a capital-intensive business; however, we have no significant commitments\nor plans for the purchase of capital items. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Net cash provided\nby financing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2004 was $6.6 million, comprised primarily of $11.0 million in borrowings under our credit facilities and reduced primarily by payments on borrowing agreements and a $2.5 million payment to\nterminate one tranche of the forward sales transaction.

', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Critical Accounting Policies ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The SEC has defined a company\x92s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company\x92s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most\ndifficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified our critical accounting policies below. We also have other key accounting\npolicies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 to our financial statements\nincluded elsewhere in this offering memorandum. We have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our board of directors. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Goodwill and intangible assets', u'. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price of certain broadcast properties over\nthe fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired and is accounted for under the provisions of SFAS 142. Under SFAS 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least on an\nannual basis. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The goodwill impairment test involves a\ncomparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units with the carrying amounts of net assets, including goodwill, related to each reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds a reporting unit\x92s fair value, the second step of the\nimpairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The impairment loss is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill in the reporting unit being\ntested. Fair values are determined based on valuations that rely primarily on the discounted cash flow method. This method uses future projections of cash flows from each of our reporting units and includes, among other estimates, projections of\nfuture advertising revenue and operating expenses, market supply and demand, projected capital spending and an assumption of our weighted average cost of capital. To the extent they have been separately identified, our indefinite-lived intangible\nassets (broadcast licenses) are tested for impairment on an annual basis by applying a fair-value-based test as required by SFAS 142. Our evaluations of fair values include analyses based on the future cash flows generated by the underlying assets,\nestimated trends and other relevant determinants of fair value for these assets. If the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and its carrying value. Changes in any\nof these estimates, projections and assumptions could have a material effect on the fair value of these assets in future measurement periods and result in an impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles which could materially effect our\nresults of operations. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We evaluate the recoverability of the\ncarrying amount of long-lived tangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, \x93Accounting\nfor the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.\x94 We use our judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine when an impairment test is necessary. Factors we consider which could trigger an impairment review include significant\nunderperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results, a significant decrease in the market value ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'of an asset, a significant change in the extent to or manner in which an asset is used, and significant negative cash flows or industry trends. ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value\nof an asset exceeds its estimated fair value, which is primarily based on future discounted cash flows. In estimating these future cash flows, we use future projections of cash flows directly associated with and that were expected to arise as a\ndirect result of the use and eventual disposition of the assets. These projections rely on significant assumptions. If it is determined that a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss would be calculated based on the excess of the\ncarrying amount of the long-lived asset over its fair value. Changes in any of our estimates could have a material effect on the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset and result in a future impairment of the involved\nassets with a material effect on our future results of operations. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Derivative instruments.', u' In 2002, we entered into a forward sales transaction with a financial institution. Our obligations under the forward sales transaction are currently collateralized by 2.6 million shares of Safeco Corporation\ncommon stock owned by us. A portion of the forward sales transaction is considered a derivative and, as such, we periodically measure its fair value and recognize the derivative as an asset or a liability. The change in the fair value of the\nderivative is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We may in the future designate the forward sales transaction as a hedge and, accordingly, the change in fair value would be recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations or\nin other comprehensive income, depending on its effectiveness. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We determine the fair value of derivative instruments based on external-party valuations, which rely on significant assumptions. The value of the forward sales transaction can change significantly, based primarily on changes in the value of\nSafeco Corporation common stock, changes in underlying assumptions concerning the volatility of Safeco Corporation common stock, and changes in interest rates. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Television and radio broadcast rights.', u' Television and radio broadcast rights are recorded as assets when the license period begins and the\nprograms are available for broadcast, at the gross amount of the related obligations. Costs incurred in connection with the purchase of programs to be broadcast within one year are classified as current assets, while costs of those programs to be\nbroadcast after one year are considered non-current. These programming costs are charged to operations over their estimated broadcast periods using either the straight-line method or in proportion to estimated revenue. Program obligations are\nclassified as current or non-current in accordance with the payment terms of the license agreement. We periodically assess net realizable value for our capitalized broadcast rights, in which we compare estimated future revenues on a\nprogram-by-program basis to the carrying value of the related asset; if the carrying value of the broadcast rights exceeds its net realizable value, we record the difference as an impairment loss, which is charged to programming expenses.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Pensions.', u' We maintain a noncontributory supplemental\nretirement program for key management. The program provides for vesting of benefits under certain circumstances. Funding is not required, but generally we have acquired annuity contracts and life insurance on the lives of the individual participants\nto assist in payment of retirement benefits. We are the owner and beneficiary of such policies; accordingly, the cash values of the policies, as well as the accrued liability, are reported in the financial statements. The program requires continued\nemployment through the date of expected retirement. The cost of the program is accrued over the participants\x92 remaining years of service at our company. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The cost of this program is reported and accounted for in accordance with accounting rules that require significant assumptions regarding discount rates\nand salary increases. We use actuarial consulting services to assist in estimating the supplemental retirement obligation and related periodic expenses. The discount rate used ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'in determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation was 6.25% at December 31, 2003, and 6.75% at December 31, 2002. The rate of\nincrease in future compensation was 3.00% at December 31, 2003, and 4.50% at December 31, 2002. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable for these key actuarial assumptions, future actual results could differ from our estimates. Future\nincreases could result if the amount of estimated Social Security benefits declines for plan participants. Changes in benefits provided by us may also affect future plan costs. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tax accruals.', u' Our federal and state income tax returns are subject to periodic examination, and the tax authorities\nmay challenge certain of our tax positions as a result of examinations. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we would vigorously defend these positions if challenged. The final disposition of any positions challenged by\nthe tax authorities could require us to make additional tax payments. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Allowance for doubtful accounts.', u' We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer\x92s inability to meet its financial\nobligations, we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected. For all other customers, we recognize reserves for bad debts based on historical experience of bad debts as a percent of past-due balances\nfor each business unit, adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the agings and changes in current economic conditions. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Estimates.', u' The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiod. Actual results could differ from those estimates. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Recent Accounting\nPronouncements ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In May 2002, the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (the \x93FASB\x94) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (\x93SFAS\x94) No. 145 \x93Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections.\x94 SFAS 145\nupdates, clarifies, and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements and became effective for our 2003 financial statements. Accordingly, a loss from extinguishment of long-term debt reported as an extraordinary item in the 2002 financial\nstatements has been reclassified to continuing operations. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In\nDecember 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 148, \x93Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation\x97Transition and Disclosure.\x94 SFAS 148 amends SFAS 123, \x93Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,\x94 to provide alternative methods of transition\nfor an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation. It also amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements\nabout the method of accounting for stock-based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The disclosure provisions of SFAS 148 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal periods beginning after December 15,\n2002 and became effective for us commencing with the first quarter of the 2003 fiscal year. Disclosures required by SFAS 148 are provided in Note 9 to these Consolidated Financial Statements. We do not currently have plans to change to the fair\nvalue method of accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'On January 1, 2003, we adopted SFAS 143, \x93Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.\x94 SFAS 143 requires entities to record the fair value of future liabilities for asset retirement obligations as an increase in the carrying\namount of the related long-lived asset if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'asset. We have certain legal obligations, principally related to leases on locations used for broadcast system assets, which fall within the scope of SFAS\n143. These legal obligations include a responsibility to remediate the leased sites on which these assets are located. The adoption of SFAS 143 did not have a material impact on our financial statements. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46,\n\x93Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51,\x94 which was subsequently revised in December 2003. FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity\nif the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The adoption\nof FIN 46 did not have a material impact on our financial statements. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149, \x93Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.\x94 SFAS 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain\nderivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under SFAS 133, \x93Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.\x94 SFAS 149 is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after June\n30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 149 did not have a material impact on our financial statements. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 150, \x93Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.\x94 SFAS\n150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. For public entities, SFAS 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified\nafter May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. SFAS 150 is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial\ninstruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption. The adoption of SFAS 150 did not have a material impact on our financial statements. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In December 2003, the FASB revised SFAS 132, \x93Employers\x92\nDisclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88 and 106, a revision of FASB Statement No. 132.\x94 SFAS 132R provides for expanded annual and quarterly disclosures with regard to pensions\nand other postretirement benefits, but does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by existing accounting standards. These additional disclosures are generally effective for the year ended December 31, 2003, with certain\ndisclosures required for quarters beginning after December 15, 2003. Additional disclosures for our supplemental retirement program have been provided in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as required by SFAS 132R. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The market risk in our financial instruments represents the potential loss\narising from adverse changes in financial rates. We are exposed to market risk in the areas of interest rates and securities prices. These exposures are directly related to our normal funding and investing activities. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Interest Rate Exposure ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our strategy in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to maintain a balance of fixed- and variable-rate instruments.\nWe will also consider entering into interest rate swap agreements at such times as our management deems appropriate. As of June 30, 2004, our fixed-rate debt totaled $64.8 million. The fair value of ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'our fixed-rate debt is estimated to be approximately $3.0 million greater than the carrying amount. Market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair\nvalue resulting from a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates and, as of June 30, 2004, amounted to $290,000. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We also had $75.6 million in variable-rate debt outstanding as of June 30, 2004. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these borrowings\nwould result in a $405,000 annual change in our pre-tax earnings and cash flows. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Marketable Securities Exposure ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The fair value\nof our investments in marketable securities as of June 30, 2004 was $132.1 million. Marketable securities consist of 3.0 million shares of Safeco Corporation common stock, valued based on the closing per-share sale price on the\nspecific-identification basis as reported on the Nasdaq stock market. As of June 30, 2004, these shares represented 2.2% of the outstanding common stock of Safeco Corporation. While we currently do not intend to dispose of our investments in\nmarketable securities, we have classified the investments as available-for-sale under applicable accounting standards. Mr. William W. Krippaehne, Jr., President, CEO, and a Director of the Company, is a Director of Safeco Corporation. A hypothetical\n10% change in market prices underlying these securities would result in a $13.2 million change in the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio. Although changes in securities prices would affect the fair value of the marketable securities\nand cause unrealized gains or losses, such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold. As of June 30, 2004, 2.6 million shares of Safeco Corporation common stock owned by the Company were pledged as collateral under the\nforward sales transaction. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'As of June 30, 2004 the derivative\nportion of the forward sales transaction had a fair market value resulting in a liability of $14.0 million, and the resulting loss of $11.5 million during the six months ended June 30, 2004 is included in net gain (loss) on derivative instruments in\nthe accompanying consolidated financial statements. A hypothetical 10% change in the market price of Safeco Corporation stock would change the market value of the forward sales transaction by approximately $8.0 million. A hypothetical 10% change in\nvolatility would change the market value of the forward sales transaction by approximately $200,000, and a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would change the market value of the forward sales transaction by approximately $300,000.\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'EX-99.3\n', u'5\n', u'dex993.htm\n', u'PRESS RELEASE\n', u'\n', u'Press Release', u'\n', u'Exhibit 99.3 ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\n', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'CONTACT:', u'\n', u'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0', u'\n', u'William W.
