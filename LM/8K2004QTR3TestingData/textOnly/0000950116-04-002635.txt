Reports', u'\nProgress In Strategic Initiatives and Discusses Preliminary', u'\nQuarterly and Year\n      End Results', u'\n', u'Philadelphia, PA\u2026August 30,\n2004\u2026 American Business Financial Services, Inc. (ABFS; NASDAQ: ABFI) today\nannounced that it achieved its best ever monthly and quarterly loan origination\nresults, producing $209 million of new loans in June 2004 and more than $509\nmillion during the quarter ended June 30, 2004. ABFS said that during the year\nended June 30, 2004, it also completed the sale of $808.4 million of mortgage\nloans with servicing released to various buyers, representing some of the most\nhighly regarded firms in the industry. In addition, subsequent to June 30, 2004,\nABFS has completed the sale of an additional $389.5 million of mortgage loans\nwith servicing released.', u'\n', u'ABFS also announced that the anticipated\n    quarterly loss for June 30, 2004 will be less than the $33.2 million loss\n    incurred for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. The loss for the quarter ended\n    June 30, 2004 is expected to be in the range of $26 million to $30 million.  \u201cAlthough\n    we fully anticipated this loss, we believe our quarterly losses are now trending\n    downward, and we believe this trend will continue during fiscal 2005, eventually\n    returning the Company to profitable operations,\u201d said Albert W. Mandia,\n    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\u201d  The loss for\n    the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 is expected to be in the range of $110\n    million to $114 million.', u'\n', u'Depending on the Company\u2019s\n    ability to securitize in the future, it anticipates incurring losses at least\n    through the first quarter of fiscal 2005, ending September 30, 2004. ABFS\n    also anticipates that losses incurred in fiscal 2005 will be less than those\n    incurred in fiscal 2004, assuming that the loan production increases experienced\n    in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 continue into fiscal 2005. The Company\n    also anticipates that it will need to originate $390 million to $490 million\n    of loans per\nmonth in order to return to profitable operations.', u'\n', u'\u201cThe loss for fiscal 2004 primarily\n    resulted from liquidity issues that we have experienced since the fourth\n    quarter of fiscal 2003, including the absence of credit facilities until\n    the second quarter of fiscal 2004. This substantially reduced our loan origination\n    volume and our ability to generate revenues. We were also unable to complete\n    a publicly underwritten securitization during fiscal 2004. In addition, as\n    a result of the historically high industry-wide refinancing activity, we\n    experienced non-cash valuation adjustments on our securitization assets,\n    which were\n    charged\n    to our\n    income\n    statement,\u201d according to Mandia.  \u201cAdjustments in the Company\u2019s\n    business strategy resulted in operating expense levels that would support\n    greater loan origination volume, which also contributed to the loss for fiscal\n    2004.\u201d', u'\n', u'Mandia continued, \u201cOur loan origination and loan sale results demonstrate that ABFS is making real progress toward achieving the goals of our adjusted business model, which emphasizes greater loan origination volume and subsequent mortgage loan sales for cash. Over the last six months, we have established a national footprint with the acquisition or opening of four sales offices, as well as establishing relationships with other brokers across the country, which is significantly improving our ability to generate wholesale originations nationwide.\u201d', u'\n', u'\u201cAlthough the volume of our loan production is increasing significantly, we are proud that the quality of our loans remains at an extremely high level,\u201d Mandia said.  \u201cThe execution of our whole loan sales is exceptional, demonstrated by the high percentage of loans purchased.  This has contributed to our improved cash flow position, as compared to June 30, 2003.  While we still face various challenges in implementing our business strategy, we believe we have made real progress to date.\u201d', u'\n', u'American Business Financial Services, Inc. is a diversified financial services organization operating throughout the United States.
