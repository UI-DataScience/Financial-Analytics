The Company\'s revolving\ncredit facility requires a lock-box arrangement, which provides for all receipts to be swept daily\nto reduce borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility, and contains a subjective\nacceleration clause, which allows the Company\'s lenders to forego additional advances should they\ndetermine there has been a material adverse change in the Company\'s operations or its financial\nposition.  The restated balance sheets will have no impact on the Company\'s previously reported\nnet income, the debt covenants under the credit agreement or its ability to draw on existing\nfacilities.
