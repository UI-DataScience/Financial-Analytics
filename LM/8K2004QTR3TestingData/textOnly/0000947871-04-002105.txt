All call participants should consider these differences when making\nsequential or year-over-year comparisons of the reported results.\n\nFor the quarter ended July 31, 2004, total contract revenues were 260.8 million\nversus 182.9 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 43 percent. Net\nincome was 17.1 million versus 11.4 million, an increase of 50 percent, while\nfully diluted earnings per share was 35 cents versus 24 cents, an increase of 46\npercent. Backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was 1.243 billion versus 1.285\nbillion at the end of the third quarter, a sequential decrease of 42 million. Of\nthis backlog, approximately 684.9 million is expected to be completed in the\nnext 12 months.\n\nOur fourth-quarter results continued to demonstrate the fundamental health of\nour business. Overall growth remained strong, internal growth for the quarter\nwas 13.1 percent, and our forecasted first-quarter revenue indicates continued\nyear-over-year moderate organic growth. While gross margin declined slightly\nfrom the year-ago quarter, G&A decreased 92 basis points and depreciation and\namortization decreased 41 basis points. Both the G&A and depreciation and\namortization percentages continue to be favorably impacted as relatively fixed\ncosts were leveraged by increased quarterly revenue.\n\nOverall, improved results were driven by tight cost controls, solid field\nproductivity, good safety performance, and active claims management, and\nexpected start-up performance from our new fiber-to-the-premise initiative.\nLiquidity remained ample, with over $40 million in net cash, increasing 3.9\nmillion sequentially from the third quarter. Capital expenditures to support our\ngrowth totaled 16.1 million net of disposals. Days Sales Outstanding was 71\ndays, essentially unchanged from 72 days for the third quarter, while cash flow\nfrom operations totaled a solid 19.9 million.\n\nDuring the quarter, we continued to experience the effects of a growing overall\neconomy, major telephone company expenditures which grew substantially\nyear-over-year, and continued robust spending by several cable customers.\nRevenue from Comcast was 61.6 million. Comcast was Dycom's largest customer for\nthe quarter at 23.6 percent of revenue, down from 28 percent in the previous\nquarter. Additionally, revenue from Charter continued to increase\nyear-over-year.\n\nOrganic revenue from BellSouth and Qwest increased compared to the year-ago\nquarter, and employee headcount increased during the quarter by 237 to 7,769 at\nthe end of the quarter. And perhaps most significantly, we continued work begun\nduring the third quarter for Verizon's fiber-to-the-premise buried plant\ninitiative in two distinct locations, including Tampa, Florida.\n\nAdditionally, we started installations in three new locations and expect to\ncommence work in two additional locations during our first quarter. We have\ncurrently mobilized over 1500 in-house and subcontractor personnel for this\nproject and are adding resources daily. Sales through Verizon were 21.8 million\nduring the quarter, up from 778,000 in the year-ago period. At over 8 percent of\nrevenue, Verizon has now become a top five customer.\n\nDuring the quarter we continued to book new work. For Charter, new build\nbetterment contracts for St. Louis, Birmingham, and St. George, Utah; in our\nlocating business, a new locating contract in Oregon for Sprint; and extensions\nwith Qwest in Denver and BellSouth in Mobile, Alabama. Additionally for Qwest, a\nlarge fiber construction project in northern Arizona, and also an additional\nRUS-type fiber deployment contract for Farmers Telephone in South Carolina.\n\nAs Dycom grew this quarter, we demonstrated our continued stability and ability\nto positively respond to growth opportunities. First and foremost, we maintained\nsolid customer relationships throughout our markets. Secondly, the strength of\nthose relationships and the value we can generate for our customers has allowed\nus to be at the forefront of rapidly evolving industry opportunities.\n\nWe are encouraged by several recent public statements by two regional Bell\noperating companies indicating a growing and accelerating commitment to deploy\nfiber deeper into their networks. We see these announcements as evidence that a\nsustained cycle of dramatic increases in capital expenditures may be just\ncommencing. In fact, we may very well be seeing the real beginning of the\noft-foretold rewiring of the nation's telecommunications infrastructure in order\nto dramatically expand the provisioning of bandwidth and the delivery of new\nservice offerings.\n\nAnd finally, while growing, we have maintained tight margin discipline, solid\ncash flows and our superior financial strength. As the economy continues to\nexpand and our industry possibly begins its own upsurge in growth, we believe\nDycom's fundamental strength will continue to allow us to differentiate\nourselves from our competitors in the eyes of our customers, employees, and\nsuppliers. Over the last several quarters, we have repeatedly stated our belief\nthat as profitable growth opportunities return to our industry we will be one of\nthe first and the best-positioned firms in our industry to take advantage of\nthem. We believe that this advantage relative to other industry participants\ncontinues to be more pronounced every day.\n\nHaving been prudently managed during our industry's downturn, we look forward to\nfurther potentially significant growth opportunities. After weighing all of the\nfactors we have discussed today, we have updated our forecast as follows. For\nthe first quarter of fiscal 2005, we anticipate earnings per share of 31 to 39\ncents on revenues of 240 to 260 million. This outlook anticipates continued\nsolid growth in the U.S. economy, normal seasonal weather, declining spending by\nComcast as it substantially completes its AT&T Broadband upgrades, and a prudent\n\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThomson StreetEvents  streetevents@thomson.com  617.603.7900\nwww.streetevents.com                                                           5\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(c) 2004 2002 Thomson Financial.

Both our Verizon buried FTTP installations and our\nlocating operations are expected by their very natures to be somewhat more\nsensitive to normal winter seasonal patterns than the rest of our business.\nGiven the increased portion of our business we expect during the second quarter\nfrom these two areas, we believe forecasting prudence is warranted.\n\nAt this point, I will turn the call over to Dick Dunn, our CFO.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDick Dunn  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - SVP, CFO\n\n\nThanks, Steve. Before I begin with my financial review, let me reiterate that\nthe current year and quarter ending July 31, 2004 contained 53 and 14 weeks,\nrespectively, compared to 52 and 13 weeks for the prior-year\'s period. All\nparticipants should consider these differences when making sequential or\nyear-over-year comparisons of the reported results.\n\nIn addition, you should be aware that for purposes of this call, we have\neliminated the following two items from our GAAP results for the current fiscal\nyear ended July 31, 2004. First, in Q3 of fiscal year 2004, we reported an\nafter-tax charge of 1.4 million related to a reserve recorded in connection with\nan ongoing federal employment tax audit relating to years prior to fiscal year\n2003. Second, the results for Q2 of the current fiscal year include an after-tax\ngain on the sale of certain long-term receivables of 6.8 million. Unless\notherwise noted, my discussion will eliminate the impact of these items. A\nreconciliation of these amounts to our GAAP net income has been provided as a\ntable to yesterday\'s press release, which is available on our website under the\nheading "Corporate" and the sub-heading "Corporate News."\n\nWith that in mind, I will begin my overview of our quarterly financial\nperformance starting with the income statement. Contract revenues for the\ncurrent quarter were 260.8 million, up 42.6 percent from last year\'s Q4 of 182.9\nmillion. Excluding revenues attributable to subsidiaries not owned during Q4 of\nfiscal year 2003, revenues for the current quarter would have been 206.8\nmillion, an increase of 13.1 percent.\n\nTotal revenues for the year ended July 31 increased 41.2 percent to 872.7\nmillion versus 2003\'s revenue of 618.2 million. Excluding revenues attributable\nto subsidiaries not owned during fiscal year 2003, revenues for the year would\nhave been 749.0 million, an increase of 21.2 percent.\n\nFor the quarter, the top five customers accounted for 62.7 percent of total\nrevenues versus 71.8 percent for the prior year\'s fourth quarter. For the year\nended July 31, sales to the top five customers as a percent of total was 63.7\npercent versus 63.9 percent for the prior year. The top five customers and their\nrespective percentages of revenue for Q4 fiscal year 2004 and 2003 are as\nfollows, beginning with Q4 of \'04. Comcast was 23.6 percent; BellSouth came in\nat 15.6 percent; Sprint at 8.6 percent; Verizon, 8.4 percent; and Qwest, 6.5\npercent. Turning to Q4 fiscal year \'03, Comcast was 38.1 percent; Sprint was\n11.6 percent; BellSouth, 10.9 percent; Adelphia, 5.7 percent; and Qwest, 5.5\npercent.\n\nNet income for the fourth quarter was 17.1 million versus 11.4 million at fiscal\nyear \'03, representing an increase of 50 percent. Net income for the year ended\nJuly 31 was 58.6 million. Excluding the two items mentioned in my opening\nremarks, net income was 53.2 million, an increase of 210.1 percent from last\nyear\'s 17.1 million. Fully-diluted earnings for the quarter were $0.35 per share\nversus $0.24 per share for fiscal year \'03, an increase of 46%.  Diluted EPS for\nthe year ended July 31, 2004 was $1.20. Excluding the two items mentioned in my\nopening remarks, diluted EPS for the year increased 202.8 percent to $1.09 per\nshare versus last year\'s 36 cents per share.\n\nOperating margins for the fourth quarter increased 20 basis points, coming in at\n10.45 percent versus last year\'s 10.25 percent. This increase was due to a 92\nbasis point decrease in G&A cost, a 41 basis point decrease in depreciation and\namortization, partially offset by 113 basis point increase in cost of earned\nrevenues. Included in G&A for the quarter was a charge of 1.2 million associated\nwith a judgment and its related expenses. This judgment resulted from a contract\ndispute which arose from Arguss Operations prior to our February \'02 purchase of\nArguss.\n\nOperating margins for the year were 9.37 percent. Excluding the charge for\npayroll tax mentioned in my opening remarks, operating margins for the year\nincreased 540 basis points, coming in at 9.63 percent versus last year\'s 4.23\npercent. This increase was due to a 120 basis point decrease in cost of earned\nrevenues, a 270 basis point decrease in general and administrative costs, and a\n150 basis point decrease in depreciation and amortization.\n\nDepreciation expense for the fourth quarter increased 1.8 million from the prior\nyear. This increase was primarily due to the capital additions associated with\nthe acquisitions of First South Utilities and UtiliQuest, partially offset by\nthe runout of depreciation associated with fiscal year \'99 capital additions and\nthe sale of assets during the current fiscal year.\n\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter and year-end periods were 39.45 percent\nand 39.7 percent, respectively, versus 42.3 and 43.7 percent respectively for\nthe prior year\'s period. These differences were attributable to the mix of\nincome among our subs and the impact that had on our state tax rates.\n\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThomson StreetEvents  streetevents@thomson.com  617.603.7900\nwww.streetevents.com                                                           6\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(c) 2004 2002 Thomson Financial.

For the quarter, our cash flow from operating activities was 19.9\nmillion. The primary components of this cash flow were net income of 17.1\nmillion, depreciation and amortization of 11.6 million, offset by increases in\nworking capital of approximately 8.8 million.\n\nInvesting and financing activities for the quarter used 17.1 million. This use\nof cash consisted of capital expenditures of 17.1 million and principal payments\non notes of 1.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of\n1 million and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of 1 million.\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were 51.4 million, up 2.8\nmillion from the prior quarter.\n\nDuring the quarter, net receivables increased from 127.4 million to 131.9\nmillion, but DSO declined 3.2 days to 49.6 versus 52.8 at the end of the third\nquarter. Net unbilled revenue balances increased in the quarter from 47.3\nmillion to 58.2 million, resulting in a DSO of 21.8 days, an increase of 2.7\ndays from Q3's figure of 19.1 days. On a cumulative basis, the combined DSO for\nour trade receivables and unbilled revenues decreased from 71.9 days to 71.4\ndays, a decrease of 0.5 days.\n\nAt July 31, the accrual for our self-insured casualty program decreased to 44.7\nmillion from 48.5 million at the end of the third quarter. During the fourth\nquarter of fiscal '04, current quarter revenues from multi-year master service\nagreements represented 55.7 percent of contract revenues versus 43.7 from Q4 of\nthe prior year. Revenues from long-term contracts and multi-year master service\nagreements represented 88.1 percent of contract revenues versus 86.9 percent for\nQ4 of the prior fiscal year.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nThanks, Dick.

Was there a charge this quarter buried in SG&A\nregarding to Arguss? Can you break that out with the pre-tax and after-tax issue\n- -- the pre-tax and after-tax number?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDick Dunn  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - SVP, CFO\n\n\nThe pre-tax, Alan, was 1.2 million. It is included in the numbers we have\ngiven. The tax would be the same effective rate for the quarter.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlan Mitrani  - Copper Beech Capital - Analyst\n\n\nThat's roughly 2 cents a share that you took in SG&A expense.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDick Dunn  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - SVP, CFO\n\n\nWell, it's a little less than that after-tax, Alan. I think it's probably --.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nAbout 1.5, I would --\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlan Mitrani  - Copper Beech Capital - Analyst\n\n\n1.5, 1.8, right -- yes, I was rounding. So are you finished with that issue?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nWhat happened, we had assumed the defense of a lawsuit as part of that\ntransaction that we were advised to be highly confident that it would not result\nin any payment. And we had a jury trial and so far we did not prevail. Now, we\nhave appeals underway, but at this point it can't get any worse.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlan Mitrani  - Copper Beech Capital - Analyst\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThomson StreetEvents  streetevents@thomson.com  617.603.7900\nwww.streetevents.com                                                           7\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(c) 2004 2002 Thomson Financial.

So the issue is resolved, at least right now, against you. If\nsomehow you appeal or do something later on, we could see some money back?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nThat is correct.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlan Mitrani  - Copper Beech Capital - Analyst\n\n\nSo with that said, just to move on, your CapEx was pretty high this quarter.\nHow much of that was related to the ramp-up of Verizon?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nThere was a significant portion there, Alan. There were also just some\nscheduled replacements. We had strong acquisition years for capital equipment in\n'98/'99, and given the bonus depreciation that we have for tax purposes this\ncalendar year, we just thought it was a good time to do it.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlan Mitrani  - Copper Beech Capital - Analyst\n\n\nThat's good. And do you have any sense of what CapEx could be this coming year?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nWe're thinking about from a budget standpoint at 35 to 40 million. It's clearly\ncontingent upon the magnitude of the Verizon ramp-up, which we are continuing to\nbuy assets for every day.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlan Mitrani  - Copper Beech Capital - Analyst\n\n\nI will ask one more question and jump back in. Verizon tripled this quarter for\nyou, and actually, Comcast didn't even decline, it seems. How much is in your\nbacklog for Verizon for the next 12 months? In the past, you've talked about\n100, 125 million. Can you give us a sense, is Verizon's ramp-up going to take\naway some of the pain of Comcast's decline?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nWe're not going to comment directly on the backlog, other than to say that it\nwas up pretty significantly in the quarter as they continue to bring projects\nonline and we get more visibility into their build. And our view, as we\nindicated in the comments, is that the potential magnitude of these\nfiber-to-the-prem or other fiber deeper deployments by the phone companies could\nbe very significant in size.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlan Mitrani  - Copper Beech Capital - Analyst\n\n\nThanks. I will jump back in queue.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator\n\n\nSteven Fox with Merrill Lynch.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCeleste Laurenzano  - Merrill Lynch - Analyst\n\n\nActually, this is Celeste Laurenzano for Steven Fox. Good morning. Quick\nquestion on the gross margin. If you can maybe talk about what puts and takes\nyou saw during this quarter, some things that may have helped or hurt on that\nline.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nI think what we saw, Celeste, in the quarter was that of the three months, June\nwas a little wetter. And so when you looked at returns generally in the business\nin June, it was a little bit depressed from either May or July. And so I think\nthat was a good portion of the difference. Clearly, we continue to ramp up\nessentially during the quarter to well over 1000 folks at Verizon. Certainly we\nhad some expenses there to get that number of people in the field.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCeleste Laurenzano  - Merrill Lynch - Analyst\n\n\nOkay. And then looking at G&A, X the judgment, the 1.2 million, going forward\non that 20 million, should we assume that that should creep up as more Verizon\nprojects roll out?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nAs we grow the Company, hopefully G&A will grow, but at a slower rate. We do\nhave an extra week, when you look at the absolute numbers, and we leave it to\nyou to make that adjustment on a more normal basis. We did have a good quarter,\nso we had some bonus expense that is recorded as G&A. But we don't see anything\nabout the new business coming on that would indicate that it had a higher\npercentage margin -- overhead profile than the business that we have now.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCeleste Laurenzano  - Merrill Lynch - Analyst\n\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThomson StreetEvents  streetevents@thomson.com  617.603.7900\nwww.streetevents.com                                                           8\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(c) 2004 2002 Thomson Financial.

With regards to backlog,\nhistorically your backlog is down 10, 15 percent sequentially from the April\nquarter to the July quarter. Your backlog for the next 12 months is actually up\nfrom April. Can you just address that and talk about how this year it is a\nlittle bit different than your historical seasonal patterns?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nI think clearly there was the ramp-up of Verizon, and we\'re still taking the\nsame prudent position we did on recording the out-year backlog, as we get more\nvisibility there. But at this point, the vast majority of that backlog is\nrecorded in the next 12 months, and so that offsets some of the normal seasonal\npattern where this quarter is not a strong one for booking backlog, just because\nit\'s the summer.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlex Rygiel  - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey - Analyst\n\n\nSome more clarity on Verizon -- you mentioned you have 1500 crew members or\nsubcontractors working on that. It sounds like it\'s about 20 percent of your\nwork force. Does that mean that in the fiscal first quarter of \'05, 20 percent\nof your revenues are going to be coming from Verizon?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nNo, I don\'t think that\'s exactly the right way to look at it, because we are\nable to use a larger percentage of subcontractors in that 1500 than we have in\nthe rest of our business, as we have talked about before. For example, our\nlocating business is all performed in-house, which remains unaffected by that\nmix shift. So we feel comfortable that we\'re going to continue to grow the\npeople deployed there, but I don\'t think that it would necessarily get to that\nlevel as quickly as you had indicated.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlex Rygiel  - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey - Analyst\n\n\nDoes that 1500 tie perfectly to the five markets that you are currently active\nin?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nYes, absolutely. That\'s where we are.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlex Rygiel  - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey - Analyst\n\n\nAnd with regards to the other two markets that you have mentioned in the past,\nare those two markets included in your backlog?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nAbsolutely, they\'re all included. Estimates that we have for the backlog\ninclude all the markets where we have visibility.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlex Rygiel  - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey - Analyst\n\n\nAnd have you included any other markets over and above the seven in your\nbacklog with regards to Verizon at this point in time?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nNo, there has been no change.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlex Rygiel  - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey - Analyst\n\n\nOkay. When you think about Verizon, Verizon was out there last week talking at\na conference, suggesting that maybe they would consider accelerating their\nfiber-to-the-premise deployment activities in 2005, maybe such that they passed\n4 million homes rather than 2 million homes. When you think about your backlog,\ncan you kind of help us to understand what plan your backlog is relative to\ntheir thinking?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nWe are taking a conservative view that the public statements that I have seen,\nAlex, indicate that they\'re thinking strategically about a bigger build and\naccelerating the number of homes passed next year. But I still think -- at least\nthe comment that I read said "could." And until "could" becomes a little bit\nmore definite, we are not altering our view on the backlog.\n\nThat being said, the bias that we have based on their public statements, that\nyou can read as well as we can, indicates that they are thinking about bigger\nrather than smaller and quicker rather than slower.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlex Rygiel  - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey - Analyst\n\n\nOne last question. You referenced fiber-to-the-premise and then you suggested\nfiber deeper to networks by some of your telco customers. BellSouth\'s revenues\non a sequential basis were up again pretty substantially, back to a pretty high\nlevel that we saw a few years back. Is that what you\'re suggesting with regards\nto that comment about fiber going deeper into the RBOCs\' networks? And the\nfollow-on was that can you discuss SBC and whether or not\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThomson StreetEvents  streetevents@thomson.com  617.603.7900\nwww.streetevents.com                                                           9\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(c) 2004 2002 Thomson Financial.

And could you give us a couple of the other customers that you normally\ngive us -- Directv -- some of the round up of the top 10 -- Directv, Charter,\nAdelphia, and Alltel?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDick Dunn  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - SVP, CFO\n\n\nDirectv was about 8.8 million. Charter was about 9.1. And Adelphia was about\n9.4.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlan Mitrani  - Copper Beech Capital - Analyst\n\n\nAnd Alltel?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDick Dunn  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - SVP, CFO\n\n\nThey're at 6.9.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlan Mitrani  - Copper Beech Capital - Analyst\n\n\nAnd Adelphia is up for being sold. We know they have not -- it's typical when a\ncompany could get sold or in the process may underspend their capital. Are you\nseeing anything out of Adelphia right now that indicates they are a bit on hold\nwith some of their capital spending plans, and then maybe can pick it up once\nthey figure out who is going to own them in a year?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nI don't know if it would be fair to say that they are underspending, Alan. I\njust think when you're in the stage of corporate life that they are in, that\nthey are taking a prudent view as to what capital dollars they should spend.\nBecause in the event -- which they still have stated they would love to stay\nindependent -- but in the event that they are sold to a different entity or\nmultiple entities, they may have different views as to what kind of architecture\nthey want to deploy. So you don't want to spend a bunch of money one way when\nperhaps somebody next year may spend it a different way.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlan Mitrani  - Copper Beech Capital - Analyst\n\n\nThat's fair. On depreciation, now that you just spent 17 million this quarter,\nwhich is like half of the past year's depreciation, I know last quarter there\nwas some amount of money, I think, that was a one-timer, Dick, or was related to\nsome equipment that had rolled off. This quarter, the depreciation seemed high.\nI know it was helped by the extra week to put the number higher, but what is a\ngood rate to use for depreciation going forward?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDick Dunn  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - SVP, CFO\n\n\nThis current run rate is probably pretty good. Last quarter, it came down a bit\nbecause of the rolloff of some '99 additions. That rolloff happened in that\nquarter. So this run rate, at least for the next four quarters, I think, with\nthe exception of how we end up with the CapEx spend, is a reasonable level base\nto start from, I guess.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlan Mitrani  - Copper Beech Capital - Analyst\n\n\nAdjusted for the 14th week, so more like 10.8?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThomson StreetEvents  streetevents@thomson.com  617.603.7900\nwww.streetevents.com                                                          10\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(c) 2004 2002 Thomson Financial.

Also, if I adjust your SG&A for the extra week and as well as the\ncharge, if I pull it out, I get roughly 18.5 million, which tells me for the\nlast couple years you have had almost no increase in SG&A, while revenues have\nbeen up about 60 percent. I know you feel you don't need to pick up SG&A that\nmuch unless you are going to get a lot of leverage. Is that still true\nfor the next 1.5 years?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nI think it depends on the growth rate. We would love to add some SG&A if we can\ncontinue to grow, and we see some opportunities that may let us, then that may\ngo up some. But I think what we're seeing is the dividends of the way we managed\nthrough the recession, that we maintained the core management group that is\nabsolutely crucial to us making money every day. And we are all working hard,\nbut we still have good capacity for growth.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlan Mitrani  - Copper Beech Capital - Analyst\n\n\nOkay. And just to understand, which markets exactly, which states are you\nworking in with Verizon? You referenced Tampa, which is Florida. I assume you\nprobably didn't get that much work done, given what the weather was this past\nquarter, but can you tell us what states typically you're working on with\nVerizon?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nAlan, we are in a position where we have a nondisclosure and confidentiality\nagreement with Verizon which allows us to talk about markets that they publicly\ndisclosed, but does not allow us to talk about anything else until they disclose\nit. So they are on the record as being in process in Tampa, and so we can\nconfirm that. But we just can't get ahead of the customer on any other\ndisclosure.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlan Mitrani  - Copper Beech Capital - Analyst\n\n\nAnd could you remind us how much of your Comcast work is typically maintenance\nwork?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nWe have set an expectation over the last several quarters of 15 to $20 million\nof business that we can see going out three or four quarters, and we're still\ncomfortable with that.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlan Mitrani  - Copper Beech Capital - Analyst\n\n\nAre you finished with the upgrades or are you still working on some markets on\nupgrades?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nThere are a few markets that are, on a limited basis, that are still\ncontinuing. And clearly, there was more of that activity in May and June than\nthere is now, which is reflected in our guidance.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlan Mitrani  - Copper Beech Capital - Analyst\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator\n\n\n(OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS) We will return to the line of Alan Mitrani.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlan Mitrani  - Copper Beech Capital - Analyst\n\n\nGuess I'm the inquisitive guy today. SBC a few months ago put out a release\nwhere they talked about looking at equipment vendors for FTTP. I know Alex's\nprevious question referenced FTTP, but can you talk about whether you think\nthere will be a construction RFP out in the next few months? It seems like SBC\nis about six months behind Verizon and BellSouth is a few months behind them.\nWhat is your view on that and where do you see that playing out and are you\npositioned to pick up work in the next 12 months from other vendors?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nI don't know that I am in a position to say who's behind who. All I can say is\nthat SBC has indicated that they see, with their fiber-to-the-prem for\ngreenfield and fiber-to-the-node for overbuilds, that they see an incremental\nspending of 4 to $6 billion over the next four or five years. I think they are\nstill settling down exactly the equipment vendors and the architecture, and I\nthink after that, you will see some more construction activity. Historically, we\nhave not done a lot of work for SBC, but we certainly see them as a key\nprospect.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlan Mitrani  - Copper Beech Capital - Analyst\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThomson StreetEvents  streetevents@thomson.com  617.603.7900\nwww.streetevents.com                                                          11\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(c) 2004 2002 Thomson Financial.

Was that clear that you don't think any of the work you're doing\nfor the next 12, 18, 24 months has any different margin profile than the work\nyou have done in the last 12-plus months?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nNo, I think the issue, Alan, is where we are. If we look a year ago, we were\nabout three quarters into the AT&T upgrades. We were busy across multiple\nmarkets and we had good margins, and we think when we get to the same stage with\nthe current upturn in the business from Verizon that the margin profiles are\ngoing to be very similar.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlan Mitrani  - Copper Beech Capital - Analyst\n\n\nSo it is just a question of building wire centers and putting in conduit --\nbeing able to have all your men deployed on the job?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nI don't want to minimize the effort of our folks. When you go from 0 to 1500\npeople in four months, there is a lot of work there, and there is a lot of\ninvestment in overhead and job overhead and in systems and structures that you\nhave to build in upfront. And while we're doing that, that may have some impact\non margin, but it is all good money because we're going to get it back as the\nprojects continue to build.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlan Mitrani  - Copper Beech Capital - Analyst\n\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't ask about -- in Florida, I am watching TV and I'm\nseeing hurricanes coming towards Florida one after the other. Can you give us a\nsense as to how much weather impacted you see this quarter and where it is for\nthis coming quarter?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nWe have had limited impacts in terms of any reduction in production. We did not\nhave substantial ariel, substantial construction in the Fort Myers to Orlando\narea. We are picking up some storm restoration work, a minor amount on power and\nsome also on the cable side, but not probably net not a significant number\neither way.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlan Mitrani  - Copper Beech Capital - Analyst\n\n\nOkay. And then as well, acquisitions, can you talk about that? You have net\ncash again. You have paid down most of your debt. It looks like there's going to\nbe more work the next 12 months and some of your competitors are still\ndislocated. What you seeing in that market? Do you expect to make acquisitions\nin the next 12 months?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nWe are always looking at the right acquisitions at the right time. We want to\nmake sure that we remain focused on running our business, because we are rapidly\npicking up some business with the telcos. But at the same time, if there's a\ngood opportunity out there, we maintain the balance sheet that will support\nacquisitions and we've done them before and we will most likely, at the right\ntime and with the right companies, do them again.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlan Mitrani  - Copper Beech Capital - Analyst\n\n\nLastly, one of your competitors is having problems in Florida. Are you seeing\nany employee -- more resumes towards you? Are you picking up any workers or\npicking up any work from competitor dislocation?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\nWe are just not in a position to comment about competitors with any specific\ndetails, other than to say that we feel comfortable that the way we have run the\nbusiness that we will be able to attract the talent that we need to continue it\ngrowing.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlan Mitrani  - Copper Beech Capital - Analyst\n\n\nThanks a lot.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator\n\n\nThank you very much.

Was it front-end loaded or back-end\nloaded?\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteven Nielsen  - Dycom Industries, Inc. - President, CEO\n\n\nIt was more loaded to the back end.\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlex Rygiel  - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey - Analyst\n\n\nAnd are all Verizon markets created equal?\n\n\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThomson StreetEvents  streetevents@thomson.com  617.603.7900\nwww.streetevents.com                                                          12\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(c) 2004 2002 Thomson Financial.
