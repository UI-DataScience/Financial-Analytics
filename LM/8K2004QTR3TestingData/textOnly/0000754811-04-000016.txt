(NASDAQ:  GROW)\n(the Company),  a boutique registered  investment advisory firm, today announced\nthe results of operations  for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2004. The Company\nposted net income of $2,166,642, or $0.29 per share, compared to a net income of\n$42,612,  or $0.01 per share, for the 2003 fiscal year.  Revenues for the fiscal\nyear ending June 30, 2004, were  approximately  $12.98 million,  or 73.6 percent\nhigher than the fiscal year 2003.\n\n"The  biggest  driver  behind  this  significant  increase  in net income is the\nsubstantial  asset growth in the Company\'s gold,  natural  resources and foreign\nequity  funds,"  says Frank  Holmes,  Chief  Executive  Officer  of U.S.  Global\nInvestors. "During this secular bull market in commodities,  investors have been\nattracted to our specialty funds due to their superior relative performance when\ncompared to their  peers.  We believe  Asia is the key driver  behind  commodity\ndemand and that global environmental  regulations are slowing the supply to meet\nthis demand.  This has been reflected in the price of its stock,  `GROW\',  which\nhas  outperformed  the S&P 500 for the past 1-, 3- and 5-year periods as of June\n30, 2004."\n\nAccording to Lipper,  as of June 30, 2004 the U.S. Global  Investors fund family\nhad several funds  leading  their peer group,  as well as the fund universe as a\nwhole.  In fact,  three U.S.  Global  funds--the  World  Precious  Minerals Fund\n(UNWPX),  the Global  Resources  Fund  (PSPFX),  and the Eastern  European  Fund\n(EUROX)--ranked  #1 in their  peer  groups  for both the 1- and  3-year  periods\nending June 30, 2004, based on total return.  (The World Precious  Minerals Fund\nranked 1 out of 48, 1 out of 39,  15 out of 30,  and 12 out of 18 gold  oriented\nfunds for the 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. The Global Resources Fund ranked 1\nout of 76, 1 out of 70, 11 out of 55, and 17 out of 20 natural  resources  funds\nfor the 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year  periods.  The Eastern European Fund ranked 1 out\nof 181, 1 out of 150, and 3 out of 118 emerging markets funds for the 1-, 3- and\n5-year periods.) As a result of such strong asset growth,  U.S. Global Investors\npaid off the remainder of its mortgage bank debt.  Through its early  repayment,\nU.S. Global expects to free up future cash flows.\n\nAlthough there was a slight market correction over the past quarter, U.S. Global\nInvestors has also seen positive growth in its own investment  portfolio for the\nyear.\n\nExpenses  for the fiscal year ending  June 30,  2004 were  approximately  $10.14\nmillion,  or 29.7  percent  higher than the 2003 fiscal  year.  Consistent  with\nincreased fund assets,  certain sub-advisory fees,  distribution  platform costs\n(e.g. Schwab) and  performance-driven  salary costs contributed to the increases\nin expenses. Regulatory costs have also added to the Company\'s expenses, but are\nnecessary to comply with  regulations  addressing  recent  scandals in corporate\nAmerica.\n\nBook value per share increased from $0.76 at June 30, 2003 to $1.14 at June 30,\n2004.\n\n', u'\n\n                                           Financial Highlights\n                                       U.S. Global Investors, Inc.\n\nSelected                                       Year ended June 30,\nFinancial Data                           2004                        2003\n                                         ----                        ----\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal Revenues                       $12,983,500                 $7,478,936\nTotal Expenses                       $10,141,019                 $7,817,883\nGain on Litigation Settlement        $        --                 $  371,057\nTax Expense (Benefit)                $   675,839                 $  (10,502)\n                                     -----------                 -----------\n\nNet Income                           $ 2,166,642                 $   42,612\n\nBasic and Diluted Net Income\nPer Share                            $      0.29                 $     0.01\n\nWeighted Average Basic Shares\nOutstanding                          $ 7,469,164                 $ 7,460,260\n\nWeighted Average Diluted\nShares Outstanding                   $ 7,533,134                 $ 7,469,120\n\nAverage Assets Under\nManagement                           $     1,344                 $     1,071\n($ in millions)\n\n\nAbout U.S. Global Investors, Inc.\n\nU.S. Global Investors,  Inc. is a registered  investment adviser with a focus on\nprofitable niche markets around the world.
