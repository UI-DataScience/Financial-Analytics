(OTC Bulletin\nBoard:  AVSY), the petroleum  industry\'s leading provider of integrated software\nsolutions,  announced  today a net income of $106,560 for the second  quarter of\n2004,  up from a $17,628 net loss for Q2 2003.  For the 6 months  ended June 30,\n2004,  net income rose to $63,631 from a net loss of $15,136 for the same period\nof 2003.\n\nThe jump in net income is due to a 115% increase in software  sales from $79,568\nin Q2 of 2003, to $171,519 in Q2 of 2004.  Software sales for the 6 months ended\nJune 30,  2004,  grew by 25.2% to $191,725  compared  to  $153,126  for the same\nperiod last year.  "With oil prices at record  highs,  oil and gas companies are\nembracing  new  technology  to  improve  efficiencies  and  make  their  current\nresources more productive," said Chuck Shreve, President of Avatar Systems. "The\npresent  activity  in  the  energy  sector,  combined  with  Avatar\'s  increased\nmarketing  efforts in 2003, have attracted many new customers looking to upgrade\ntechnology  as a way to save  their two most  valuable  commodities  -- time and\nmoney."\n\nNet revenues  for the second  quarter of 2004 were up 8% over those for Q2 2003,\nincreasing  from $431,719 to $466,203.  Net revenues for the 6 months ended June\n30, 2004,  fell by 8.4% to $781,214  compared  with $852,620 for the same period\nlast year. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower hardware sales in the\nsecond quarter when compared with an exceptional quarter ended June 20, 2003.\n\nShreve anticipates  Avatar\'s positive sales growth to continue.  "Avatar remains\ncommitted  to fully  supporting  customer  needs with  exceptional  products and\nservice," he said. "Our ongoing  investment in research and development  ensures\nthat Avatar customers will continue to receive  affordable  solutions as well as\nthe most advanced technology designed for the petroleum industry."\n\n\nAvatar Systems,  Inc. is based in Dallas, Texas.

"An annual  subscription\ngives oil and gas companies  high-speed  Internet access to process data and top\nquality network and server  infrastructures  on which to run it. They don\'t need\nto purchase a server or perform backup. All customers need to access our network\nis an Internet connection from anywhere in the world."\n\nIn spite of the fact that Avatar has conducted no marketing to date, interest in\nthe Petroware  2000 ASP program is strong.  Avatar plans to initiate a marketing\neffort in the third  quarter  of this  year.  "We  expect to see a surge in this\nsector of business as all  applications  move  toward  Internet  delivery in the\nfuture," said Shreve.  "Like our maintenance  agreement,  the Petroware 2000 ASP\nprogram is a recurring  revenue model,  which we anticipate will produce a major\nrevenue  stream in 3 to 5 years.  To generate  additional  revenue,  Avatar will\nconsider  leveraging the network structure by hosting third party  applications,\nincluding those outside the oil and gas industry."\n\nAvatar Systems,  Inc. is based in Dallas, Texas.
