Gross margin was 64% in the current quarter\nversus 63% in last year's third quarter.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense grew 18% and was 38% of revenue, the\nsame as in last year's third quarter. Corporate expense decreased to $2.5\nmillion, down 26% from the third quarter of 2003, as expenses to maintain\nCooper's global trading arrangement declined.\n\nOperating income grew 25% and improved to 25% of revenue versus 23% in last\nyear's third quarter. Total operating expenses were 40% of revenue, the same as\nin last year's third quarter.\n\n                                                                          Page 2\n\n\n\n\n\n", u"\n\n\nCurrency fluctuations did not significantly impact operating income in the\nquarter. Because CVI manufactures the majority of its lenses in the United\nKingdom with costs denominated in pounds sterling, and CSI imports some of its\nproducts from Europe and Canada, the unfavorable currency translation of\nmanufacturing and operating costs tends to offset the currency gains on overseas\nrevenue.\n\nIncome before taxes grew 24%, despite $456 thousand of foreign exchange loss\ncompared to $282 thousand of foreign exchange gain in the prior year. Interest\nexpense fell 12%, reflecting both a general decrease in interest rates and the\nCompany's refinancing of part of its higher interest debt in the third quarter\nof 2003.\n\nBecause accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require\nthe projected fiscal year ETR to be used when reporting year-to-date results,\nthe ETR was decreased to 22% in the second fiscal quarter reflecting the\nfavorable shift of business through jurisdictions with lower tax rates. The 19%\nETR in the third quarter reflects the 22% ETR and a release from reserves of\nabout $700 thousand. Cooper now expects that the ETR for fiscal 2004 and the\nfourth quarter of 2004 will be 21% and 22%, respectively.\n\nCompared to the third quarter of 2003, the number of shares used to calculate\ndiluted earnings per share increased 5% to 34.1 million shares.\n\nWithout the contribution of the $700 thousand tax adjustment and the foreign\nexchange losses, third quarter earnings per share would have been 69 cents.\n\nThird Quarter 2004 Business Unit Operating Summaries ($'s in millions)\n\n", u'\n', u'\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    CooperVision                CooperSurgical\n                              --------------------------------------------------------\n                               2004       %     % chg      2004    % Rev   % chg vs\n                                         Rev    vs 2003                      2003\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u'\nNet sales                     $102.8    100%       17%    $26.3     100%      27%\nCost of sales                   34.2     33%       13%     11.7      45%      22%\n                              ------                      -----\nGross profit                    68.6     67%       19%     14.6      55%      31%\nSG&A                            38.1     37%       18%      8.4      32%      47%\nR&D and amortization             1.5      1%       23%      1.0       4%      66%\n                              ------                      -----\nTotal operating expense         39.6     38%       18%      9.4      36%      49%\n                              ------                      -----\nOperating income              $ 29.0     28%       21%    $ 5.2      20%       8%\n                              ======                      =====\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n', u"\n\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights\n\n     o    At the end of the third fiscal quarter, Cooper's days sales\n          outstanding (DSO) decreased to 62 days from 66 days a year ago due to\n          improved collection of both CVI domestic and international\n          receivables.

Thomas Bender, Cooper\'s chief executive officer.\n\n "Our specialty lens franchise--toric, cosmetic, and multifocal lenses and\nlenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms--continues to gain momentum, while our\nvalue-added monthly disposable spherical and aspherical products continue to\ncapture market share from two-week commodity disposable spherical lenses.\n\n"CVI\'s global toric revenue, 41% of our soft contact lens business, grew 23%\nover the third quarter of 2003 and 25% year to date.\n\n"The market remains robust. During the second calendar quarter, contact lens\nrevenue worldwide reported by the five leading contact lens manufacturers grew\n15%--10% in constant currency--and increased 13% in the United States according\nto independent market research data.\n\n"Through six months, the data indicates that the global market has grown 9% in\nconstant currency and the U.S. market has grown 11%."\n\nThird Quarter and Year-To-Date CooperVision Worldwide Highlights\n\n     o    CVI\'s worldwide revenue of $102.8 million grew 17% over last year\'s\n          third quarter--13% in constant currency--and is 19% ahead for the\n          year--13% in constant currency.\n\n     o    CVI\'s specialty lenses--toric, cosmetic, multifocal lenses and lenses\n          to alleviate dry eye symptoms--grew 22% over last year\'s third quarter\n          and accounted for nearly two-thirds of its global soft lens business.\n          Year to date, specialty lens revenue is ahead 25%.\n\n     o    Sales of toric lenses, which correct astigmatism, increased 23% over\n          the third quarter of 2003 and accounted for 40% of CVI\'s global\n          contact lens revenue.

Because CVI manufactures the majority of its lenses in the United\nKingdom, the favorable impact of currency on revenue tends to be offset by the\nunfavorable translation of manufacturing and operating costs outside the United\nStates. The effect of currency on operating income in the quarter was not\nsignificant.\n\nSG&A expense grew 18% during the quarter compared to revenue growth of 17%.\n\nProposed Acquisition of Ocular Sciences, Inc.\n\nIn July, Cooper and Ocular Sciences, Inc.(Nasdaq: OCLR) announced that they had\nsigned a definitive agreement for Cooper to acquire Ocular in a merger in which\nOcular stockholders will be entitled to receive 0.3879 of a share of Cooper\ncommon stock and $22.00 in cash, without interest, for each share of Ocular\ncommon stock they own.\n\nAt closing, expected in the first quarter of Cooper's 2005 fiscal year, which\nbegins on November 1, 2004, Cooper will pay approximately $600 million in cash\nand issue approximately 10.5 million shares of its common stock to Ocular\nSciences stockholders and option holders.\n\nCompletion of the transaction, which has been unanimously approved by the boards\nof directors of both companies, is subject to customary closing conditions,\nincluding approvals of each company's stockholders and expiration of the waiting\nperiod required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and\napproval of the Company's registration statement by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission.

CSI\'s\noperating margin was 20% for the quarter, down from 23% in the third quarter of\n2003, reflecting integration expenses of two recent acquisitions - SURx and\nMilex - and increased marketing expenditures.\n\nCSI plans to increase marketing expenses over the next 12 to 18 months for\nprograms designed to increase the organic growth of its business. These programs\nwill focus on CSI\'s products in the incontinence, infertility and female\nsterilization markets using its restructured sales force of 175 independent and\ndirect sales representatives.\n\nConvertible Senior 2.625% Debentures and Proposed Changes to FASB 128\n\nIn the third quarter of 2003, we issued $115 million of 2.625% contingently\nconvertible senior debentures due on July 1, 2023. The debentures are\nconvertible into 22.5201 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount\nor approximately 2.6 million shares.\n\nBecause Cooper\'s share price has exceeded the conversion price specified for the\nsecurities, earnings per share will be diluted to account for the additional\nshares that could be issued beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter 2004. As the\nCompany has a right to and intends to redeem the principal for cash, current\naccounting standards define the level of dilution as equal to the number of\nshares that might become issued exclusive of the principal amount. This would\ndilute fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 earnings per share by about 4 cents at\ncurrent share price levels. This estimated dilution is included in the fourth\nquarter and fiscal 2004 earnings per share guidance and the 2005-2007 guidance\nfor the proposed combination of Cooper and Ocular.\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued an Exposure Draft, "Earnings\nPer Share - an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 128" that requires contracts with\nan option to settle the principal in cash or stock to presume a stock settlement\nfor fully diluted earnings per share computations. If adopted, this could\nrequire Cooper to include additional shares in the computation of diluted\nearnings per share beginning in the fiscal first quarter 2005 and subsequent\nperiods and could also require the Company to restate prior period earnings per\nshare for the comparative amounts.\n\nThe proposed method could dilute Cooper\'s fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 fully\ndiluted earnings per share by 11 cents and 13 cents, respectively. The\nincremental dilution between the current and the proposed accounting methods is\nnot included in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2004 earnings per share guidance\nor the 2005-2007 guidance for the combination of Cooper and Ocular.\n\n\n                                                                          Page 7\n\n\n\n\n\n', u'\n\n\nEarnings Per Share\n\nAll per share amounts in this news release refer to diluted per share amounts.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn this news release, we report Cooper\'s "cash flow per share" as 99 cents for\nthe third quarter of fiscal 2004, 84 cents for the third quarter of 2003 and\n$3.67 for the 12 months ended July 31, 2004.\n\nAlthough "cash flow per share" is a non-GAAP financial measure, we disclose it\nbecause we think it is the most appropriate measure of our liquidity and\nfinancial strength, particularly when calculated consistently over time.\n\nIn Cooper\'s case, cash flow per share is more informative than the more common\nnon-GAAP measure of liquidity called "earnings before interest, taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization" (EBITDA) because unlike most companies, Cooper\ndoes not expect to pay federal income taxes until about 2007, when we expect to\nexhaust the usage of our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. Cooper has a\nsignificant competitive advantage, as most companies expend a large portion of\ntheir pretax profits on taxes. Readers should understand this and judge our\nfinancial strength accordingly.\n\nTo calculate "cash flow per share," we add back non-cash charges for\ndepreciation and amortization to income before income taxes, and then divide the\nresult by the average number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per\nshare. In the tables below, we reconcile earnings per share (the closest GAAP\ndisclosure) to "cash flow per share" for all periods reported using the same\ndiluted per share figures.\n\n\n                                                                          Page 8\n\n\n\n\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n                           I.
