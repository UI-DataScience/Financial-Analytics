(NASDAQ: REMC), today announced financial results for its second quarter of fiscal year 2005, which ended July 30, 2004. Net sales from continuing operations for the three months ended July 30, 2004 increased 35.6% to $108.8\nmillion as compared to $80.2 million for the quarter ended August 1, 2003. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'For\nthe quarter ended July 30, 2004 the Company reported a net loss of $76.5 million or $1.23 per share which included a goodwill impairment charge of $62.4 million. This loss compares to a loss of $3.6 million in the prior year second quarter.\n\x93While the business environment in the wireless industry remains challenging, we believe that we are making good progress in realigning our businesses to achieve profitability,\x94 stated Tom Waechter, REMEC\x92s new President and CEO. He\ncontinued, \x93We conducted an impairment analysis of the goodwill associated with our commercial wireless business and determined that it should be written off in its entirety. This $62.4 million non-cash charge reflects the significant downward\nprofit challenges in the wireless marketplace resulting from industry overcapacity and our continuing losses. Additionally, approximately $5 million of our second quarter loss is attributable to actions directly related to our drive to\nprofitability. We believe that a significant portion of these expenses will not recur.\x94 Mr. Waechter went on to say, \x93We are reporting discontinued operations this quarter. During the quarter we entered into negotiations to sell two of our\nnon-core businesses, one of which sold in August for $3 million plus notes. The second is expected to sell during the third quarter. We are exploring a number of strategic and financing alternatives, including the sale of additional business units\nand have engaged a financial advisor to assist us in this process. Our shareholder value enhancement actions are expected to generate significant levels of cash and to place the Company on a solid financial and operational footing.\x94 ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Commercial Wireless Systems\x92 net sales were $84.5 million for the three months ended\nJuly 30, 2004, up 40.3% from the comparable year earlier quarter. Net sales in the Defence & Space segment rose 21.4%, to $24.3 million as compared to $20.0 million for the prior year second quarter. Revenues in the Defence & Space segment\ncontinue to grow and the backlog of orders continues to exceed twelve months of sales. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Company Gross profits for the quarter of $9.9 million, or 9.1% of sales, were negatively impacted by the low-to-negative margins on our new amplifier and filter products and not yet obtaining the benefit of the ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'China bill of materials on the filter products that have been moved from Finland to China. Additionally there were\napproximately $4 million in charges related to asset write-offs and severance costs. Zero value inventory sales were $0.6 million for the quarter. The prior year second quarter gross profit of $19.9 million, or 24.8% of sales, included $2.8 million\nof zero value inventory sales and had the benefit of stronger margins in essentially all business segments. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, decreased from 14.4% of sales for the three months ended August 1, 2003 to 13.0% of sales for the three months ended July 30, 2004. SG&A costs totalled\n$14.2 million for the three months ended July 30, 2004 as compared to $11.6 million for the comparable prior year quarter, an increase of $2.6 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of bad debt reserves, expenses for strategic\nconsulting, and the Company\x92s Sarbanes-Oxley implementation project. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Research and development expenses decreased $1.3 million, or 10.5%, for the three months ended July 30, 2004 as compared to the comparable prior year quarter. Expenses were $11.8 million in the prior year period, which compares to $10.5\nmillion for the three months ended July 30, 2004. The decrease was primarily due to improved cost controls. As a percentage of net sales, research and development expenses decreased to 9.7% for the three months ended July 30, 2004 compared to 14.7%\nin the comparable prior year. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The Company\x92s cash and short-term\ninvestments balances as of July 30, 2004 totalled $26.4 million, a decrease of $8.1 million from the prior quarter. During the quarter REMEC\x92s revolving line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank was increased to $30 million under two-year\nagreement which is secured by substantially all of the Company\x92s domestic assets, principally trade receivables and inventory. Approximately half of this line is available for funding operating requirements, the balance is absorbed by the line\ncoverage required by currency hedging and letters of credit.

I\x92d like to start the call with some opening remarks, then I\x92ll ask Winston to review our financials for the\nsecond quarter of our 2005 fiscal year. And then, following some final remarks, we\x92ll take your questions for the remainder of the time we have together today. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'I am pleased to have been recently selected by the REMEC Board of Directors to lead the company forward as the CEO. As CEO of REMEC, an\nimportant part of my mission will be to continue to build on the world-class reputation that REMEC enjoys for the unrivaled quality of its products and the ability to integrate those products into a competitive solution for our customers. Key to\nthis mission is to achieve our primary objective of sustainable operating profitability. While the business environment in the wireless industry remains challenging, we believe that we are making good progress in re-aligning our business to achieve\nour profitability goals. On the defense and space side of the business, the news continues to be very positive. Revenues are running at record rates, and the backlog of orders remained well beyond 12 months of sales. Net income is healthy, with a\npositive cash flow. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The wireless systems business is a different situation. We\nare competing under very severe industry conditions today. The price of a base station has decreased 25 to 30 percent year-on-year over the last three years. Added to this already difficult industry pricing situation, REMEC has, over time, burdened\nitself with an overly complex organization, the result of not completely integrating its past acquisition. Since the beginning of our fiscal year, we have accelerated our efforts to respond to those challenges, capitalize on our strengths, and\neliminate our weaknesses. Our strengths include the performance of our commercial wireless products, our engineering designs aimed at integrating leading functionality in a cost-competitive package, and our customer-oriented responsiveness. Proof of\nthis strength is our expanding customer base and adoption of our 2G and 3G state-of-the-art offerings. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our weaknesses have been our lag in controlling manufacturing costs and in optimizing our supply chain at the same time that we are integrating our acquisition. In response, our Board of Directors adopted a\ncomprehensive operational improvement plan, which, as the Chief Operating Officer until recently and now as CEO, I have had, and will continue to have, the main responsibility to implement. Let me update you on these efforts before addressing other\nspecific operating or market conditions. The status of the ongoing improvement initiative as is follows. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Cash \x97 the cash burn in Q2 was reduced to less than one-half of the cash burn in the previous quarter. This was achieved through effective control of inventory and capital expenditures. Inventory was reduced by\n10.3m, and capital expenditures were held to 3.2m, a decrease of one-third from our first quarter spending rate of 4.8m. This was accomplished without sacrificing service to our customers or delaying important new product introductions. ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Accounts receivable grew during the quarter by 1.9m. All of that increase was due to\nrecord FY \x9105 revenues during the month of July. Balances greater than 60 days actually decreased by 2.2m during the quarter, a result of stepped-up efforts by our sales and accounting teams to work with customers to improve our collection\nprocesses. We expect to see continued improvement in this area. The net result of our focus on asset management is that we have cash resources on hand to effectively operate our business going forward. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Sale of non-core businesses \x97 we had made a commitment to reduce non-core assets that\nhad been a drain on our profitability and our management focus. In our previous conference call, we announced the divestiture of our artificial intelligence and fixed wireless access asset, and stated that we were moving along two additional\ndisposals that have also been contributing to our losses. We continue to make progress, with our third non-core business being sold in August. The nano-wave business sold for 3m in cash and a note. Cash proceeds from this sale will benefit us in Q3.\nWe also signed a letter of intent for the sale of fourth\x97 of a fourth non-core business. We expect closure of that sale by late Q3 or early Q4. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Product line organization \x97 we announced over a quarter ago management reorganization on all product lines so that our product line leaders could better serve our\ncustomers and improve product line financial performance throughout the entire product delivery cycle. Our product line leaders have now been given much broader responsibility for developing, engineering, manufacturing and distributing our products\nin each of our core product lines. The new product line organization continues to gain excellent traction. This product-focused organization is at the heart of all of our improvement programs, and has enabled us to multiply and accelerate their\ndeployment. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'Reduction of headcount in high-cost areas: we had announced our intent to reduce our headcount in the high-cost areas.\nThe restructuring plan announced in Q1 of this year has been completed. The estimated annual savings for these reductions is $24 million. A key point of the program has been to phase out our Finland-based manufacturing activities and ramp up our\nChinese manufacturing base. Over the last nine months, headcount of Finland operation has been reduced by over 500 employees. This high-cost labor has been replaced in China with a much lower cost workforce. In a similar time frame, our China\nworkforce has increased from 150 to close to 1,000 employees. We now have 35 design engineers located at our Shanghai facility. With manufacturing wages that are less than 20 percent of Finland\x92s, this move represents a significant savings for\nus, and gives us a strong platform to address Chinese market opportunities, at the same time respond to our global customer\x92s demand for such local Chinese presence. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Supply chain savings \x97 we are making significant progress in our supply chain savings efforts. With the sourcing materials ramping in\nChina, the cost of direct materials is being driven down. The cost savings in the first half of this year have exceeded $8m. This will further improve as the Chinese source material for a major OEM customer were qualified in late July. Full benefit\nof changing from European materials to Chinese materials for these high-volume filter products will be realized starting in September when all the European material has been used. Beyond these milestones, we are continuing to review how we can\nfurther reduce our material and logistics costs going forward. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Leading\nmanufacturing \x97 as Bob Shaner [sp] discussed on our previous quarterly call, we have been reviewing the ways many of our products are engineered and manufactured. We have launched a lean manufacturing program whereby our manufacturing processes\nare better coordinated as a product goes through its many assembly and testing steps. The kickoff of lean manufacturing has exceeded expectations with its introduction in our Costa Rica facility. The initial production line bring-up of lean has\nreduced floor space and direct labor requirements by 20%, with work in inventory being reduced to one-third of its previous dollar value. Lean manufacturing is now being launched in both the Philippines and China factories simultaneously. The\nbenefits of the Chinese manufacturing operation continue to grow, with loaded labor rates running at one-half of what they were at the beginning of the year. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Operating expenses \x97 through labor reductions and other forms of cost savings, we have been able to reduce operating expense as a percentage of revenue by seven\npercentage points year-on-year. Additional savings are being worked as we drive toward our goal of managing operating expenses to a level of no greater than 20% of our revenues on an ongoing basis. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'As you can see, there is not a single aspect of our business that we are not proactively\nengaged in improving so that our shareholders obtain better results for their investment. I would like to acknowledge the very high level of effort that our employees have expended in achieving success with these improvement programs to date. The\npersonal commitment has been significant. Although many of these accomplishments have been overshadowed in the financial results of Q1 and Q2 by the relentless ASP erosion that has occurred, I do see us reaching a crossover point in the second half\nof the year, where the benefits of the improvement programs start to offset our negative earnings trend. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The key point of my mission as CEO being the achievement of profitability requires that we not only take these above-mentioned improvement programs to full completion, but also focus on additional initiatives. These\ninclude focusing on the optimization of supply chain savings, gaining design engineering efficiencies through lean concepts, cost reducing low margin and high-volume product, and the further migration of our operations to low-cost areas. The\noutsourcing of certain mature products is presently under review as well. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Now\nI will provide an overview of the market and our financial results. Winston will follow with a more detailed account for the financials. Overall, the demand for our products from global customer base remains strong. As mentioned earlier, defense and\nspace backlog exceeds 12 months of revenue. For wireless systems, the demand for tower-mounted amplifiers, ODUs and transceivers exceeds our present capacity. We are in the process of ramping capacity to meet the increasing demand. Regarding power\namplifiers and filters, the demand has grown, but the precise mix of products has been somewhat unpredictable. This fluctuating model mix and the wide range of gross margins for these products makes inventory management quite challenging. It also\ndrives significant swings in gross margins from quarter to quarter. Q2 is an example where we had two of the lowest margin power amplifier products shift in heavy volumes during the quarter, negatively impacting our gross margin expectations for the\nquarter. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Although a smaller part of our total business, we did see increased\ndemand from network operators for power amplifier sales at the end of Q2. Pricing pressure from our customers remains intense. We experienced a significant contractual price reduction with a major filter customer in July that amounted to 1.24\x97\n1.4m in lost revenue and lower margins. This price reduction was not offset by reduced material cost in China in Q2 because of qualification schedules. However, we will see this offset occur for most of Q3. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Besides the timing of ASP decreases and unfavorable product mix in Q2, we also incurred\nseverance costs related to restructuring, one-time non-cash asset write-offs and other general cleanup items. As we mentioned in previous calls, our desire is to clean up all aspects of our business in addition to selling non-core business units.\nThis will help us to set the stage for achieving our profitability goals. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston will now go through the financial results in detail and provide a summarized listing of one-time costs and charges that occurred in Q2 with a comparison to Q1 run rates. As Winston will detail shortly, we have also taken significant\nfinancial charges this quarter to right our businesses and align our financial structure with the industry realities we confront in our commercial wireless markets. The details of this will be covered as part of Winston\x92s remarks. ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston? ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Thanks, Tom. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Before I get into the details of the income statement and balance sheet, I\x92d like to\ntake a minute and discuss goodwill and the write-off\x97 the impairment write-off we took in the quarter. As you saw in the numbers that we provided to you, we took a 62.4m non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter. This $62.4m represents\nall of the goodwill associated with our commercial wireless business. As many of you know, we are required to do a goodwill impairment analysis at the end of every quarter and, based upon the results of our analysis, it was determined that we should\nno longer carry the goodwill associated with our commercial business units as an asset. The key factors driving this were ongoing significant margin\x97 the ongoing significant margin pressures that exist in the wireless marketplace due in large\npart to industry over-capacity; and secondly, to the\x97 the perception that this condition is not expected to change materially until additional business consolidations have occurred. And adding to all that is our own continuing losses do not\nsupport retaining our commercial goodwill as an asset. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'And I like to point out\nthat, even though the analysis tends to be somewhat mechanical, the industry performance and industry outlook, along with the company\x92s historical and current period performance are major driving factors in this analysis. But the net result is\nthe goodwill write-off. We think this is the right decision to make for the business. I think it takes goodwill away and postures us with a clean\x97 virtually no intangibles on our balance sheet as we go forward. We still have a little bit of\ngoodwill on our defense books, about $3m. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'If you look at the key elements of\nthe income statement, I\x92d like to start out with sales, and sales from continuing operations were 109m in the first quarter. This was about $1m below the level experienced in the first quarter, but it was within our range of expectations.\nI\x92d like to point out that, once the decision has been made to sell a business, we no longer carry those businesses in the\x97 all the elements of the income statement and balance sheet, but rather we picked those up as a single line item in\nthe income statement and a single line item on the balance sheet identified as \x93discontinued operations.\x94 The sales from these\x97 the two units that Tom mentioned were approximately $6m in the first quarter, and a similar number in the\nsecond quarter. Of course, the sales do not show up. The only thing that shows up is the operating profit or loss. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The\x97 as you look at the sales by geographical area, we had somewhat of a mix change going from the first quarter to the second quarter. We had about 50\x97 almost\nexactly 50% of our sales were in North America during the quarter. This was up about 20% as a percentage of our total sales from quarter to quarter. Europe was also up about 10%, accounting\x97 at $44m, accounting for about 40% of our sales, and\nAsia and the rest of the world declined to about 10%. As I said earlier, sales from period to period were essentially flat. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Looking at our top 10 customers, we had three customers account for more than 10% of our sales. That compared to about two customers\x97 that compared to two customers\nin the first quarter, and the\x97 interestingly, the top 10 customers accounted for about 73% of our sales in the quarter. Now, that compares to something that\x92s in the mid to low 60s in the prior quarters and in fiscal 2004. Our Q2 loss\nbefore the goodwill impairment charge was $14m. This loss compared to a $7m loss in the first quarter. When we adjust for severance and the other charges that Tom mentioned, our ongoing operating loss for the second quarter was pretty much the same\nas that experienced during the first quarter. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Some of the major items that\nwere in these non-recurring items are\x97 we like to believe they\x92re going to be non-recurring\x97 was about $3.6m in working capital, reserves, receivables and inventory, and to\x97 and a little bit on lower of cost to market adjustments\non inventory associated with some of our startup programs. About half of that was associated with a kind of an assessment of the assets in the\x97 our wireless enhancement business that we are taking a critical look at to determine exactly what\ndirection we are going to take without business. An additional 1.3 was severance. As Tom indicated, that was primarily Finland, and reflects the phase two reductions that took place in Finland, and then we spent about one million\x97 a little over\n$1m, to about 1.1m, for strategic consulting and also our S-OX implementation program. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Like everybody else that\x92s a public company, our S-OX implementation costs are not insignificant. They were about $350,000 during the quarter. They will grow in Q3 and Q4 as the pace on this effort picks up. The balance, which is a\nstrategic consulting, was tied to the lean manufacturing Tom talked about, and also looking at business opportunities that\x92s where we\x97 that are in adjacent markets where we can take the business and those\x97 although there\x97 we may\nspend a few dollars as we go forward, they will not be nearly as significant as that which we spent in the second quarter. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'And also as Tom indicated, we had about\x97 you had specifically identifiable on two other programs, 1.4m in pricing impact quarter-over-quarter, as a result of getting\nthe China bill of materials. The pricing reductions will still be there, but we will\x97 we should see\x97 we expect to see improved margins on those products as a result of a lower bill of material costs. Also, we\x92ll have the benefit of\nthose products being built in China as opposed to shipping products back and forth, which will save us on the logistics of some of the other costs. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'In previous quarters\x97 as in previous quarters, our loss was driven by low gross margins and relatively high operating expenses even after you get done with these\none-time adjustments, which gets back to Tom\x92s point about our need to get those in line. And we have a number of initiatives underway to further reduce our operating expenses and improve gross margin, and that, along with some other things\nwe\x92ll talk about\x97 that we\x92ve ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'been talking about, are really to the keys to our driving the business successfully to profitability. Gross profit at\n9.9m was 9.1% of sales. The defense business was much more profitable than was the commercial business. As Tom indicated, on the commercial side, the continuing pricing pressures there have\x97 are the major factor in dealing with that, but\nwe\x92ve also got continuing costs associated with Finland, China. We\x92ve got\x97 as we\x92ve talked about before, we still have duplicate costs in Finland that, until we\x92re completely out of there from a manufacturing standpoint,\nwill not go away. The logistics costs associated with that are not insignificant, and then you\x92ve got some of the startup and learning as we bring\x97 as we continue to bring that China factory up to speed. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The one thing that Tom mentioned that will help us in this whole process is the attention\nwe\x92re paying on the logistics and supply chain, and as we look on a go-forward basis, we expect to see considerable improvements as a result of those actions. Operating expenses, as Tom indicated, were down about $2m, or a little over\x97\nlittle less than 10% on the quarter. One of the\x97 operating expenses have\x97 although they\x92re high, have tracked pretty much in line with what our expectations have been, and it is an area that we need to continue to look at, and are\ndoing so as we speak. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our operating loss, excluding goodwill, was $14m. That\ncompares to a\x97 $14m compares to a $5.2m loss in the same quarter a year ago. It\x92s appropriate to point out that there were\x97 there was about $3-1/2m in items last year that do not recur this year in the nature of some zero value\ninventory sales, the sale of a building in the U.K. and some foreign exchange, and a couple of other things. If you look at our current quarter other income, that was primarily driven by a foreign currency gain and a couple other smaller items.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Looking at the cash and the balance sheet items, as Tom indicated, our cash is\nat $26m. That\x92s an $8m decrease from April. A major portion of that was driven by the operating loss. The operating loss was $14m, much of which was non-cash, but the lion\x92s share of the loss. Tom talked about the inventory reductions and\nthe capital expenditure reductions that we\x92re driving, and those have been partially offset, as he indicated, by higher receivables and some lower payables. The lower payables come about as we reduce our inventory levels. Our payable levels are\nnot as high as they were when\x97 with the higher inventory levels. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'As\nyou\x97 the day sales and receivables continues in or about 60 to the mid-60 days, which is a very good performance. As you kind of look overall\x97 at our cash position, we continue to expect to see near-term pressure on our operating cash as\nwe implement our profit improvement actions. However, we would like to point out that we have no debt, and the borrowing ability that we have under our domestic bank line that we announced about a month ago, along with the international line that\nwe\x92re currently working to put in place, plus the significant levels of cash we expect to generate from our strategic initiatives, we believe puts us in a solid financial and operational footing, the financial, from the standpoint of being able\nto drive the improvement actions that we\x92ve got underway, and financial, from the standpoint of having the cash\x97 having a strong cash and balance sheet to take those actions. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Thanks, Winston. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Before turning to your questions, I\x92ll do a brief summary. I am very pleased with the exceptional efforts of our employee team during this very difficult pricing\nenvironment. The majority of improvement programs that we have been tracking with you each quarter are progressing to plan. As a matter of fact, the lean initiative has been fully embraced by our factories and is running ahead of schedule. The major\nexception to this has been the complex task of migrating manufacturing and the supply base from Finland to China. Although delays have been costly and frustrating for all of us, the majority of this effort is finally behind us. The demand for our\ncustomer base remained strong, with two product lines being limited by our ramp capacity. Customer pricing remains an issue, and the downward pressure has not been completely offset by our improvement programs. We will continue to focus on reducing\ncosts at the same time we become more selective with respect to product sales and related gross margins. Our expectations are for operational cash burn to continue to decrease in the go-forward quarters, with additional cash to be received from the\nsale of non-core businesses. We continue to evaluate a significant range of alternatives related to driving increased shareholder value. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'I will now open it up to questions. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'QUESTION AND ANSWER ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Operator ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Thank you. Our question and answer session will be conducted electronically. If you do have a question or a comment at this time, we do ask that you please press star,\nfollowed by the digit one, on your touchtone telephone at this time. Once again, that\x92s star, followed by the digit one, on your touchtone telephone at this time. We\x92ll proceed in the order that you signal us, and we will take as many\nquestions as time permits. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our first question today will come from Matt\nRobison with Ferris Baker & Watts. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Matt Robison - ', u'Ferris Baker & Watts - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Hi, good afternoon. Can you comment on some of the items that were in your release, such as other income taxes, if any, and what the net income number was? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'I think as I indicated, the net income number was\x97 give me just a second. The major\nthing in other income was foreign exchange, as I indicated in my comments. The net loss was $76.5 million, but if you take this 62.4 on top of goodwill impairment away from that. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Matt Robison - ', u'Ferris Baker & Watts - Analyst', u' ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yeah, but that\x92s //. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yeah, and that\x97 I\x92m sorry? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Matt Robison - ', u'Ferris Baker\n& Watts - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'They didn\x92t pay any taxes, right?\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman -\n', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'No. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Matt Robison - ', u'Ferris Baker\n& Watts - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'And the other income, do you have that\nnumber? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman -\n', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yes, it was 463,000. Half of\nthat\x92s goodwill. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Matt Robison -', u' Ferris Baker & Watts - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'All right. When do you expect to do a full income statement and balance sheet? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We are releasing our 10-Q today. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Matt Robison - ', u'Ferris Baker & Watts -\nAnalyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK. So, we\x92ll be able to pick up all the balance\nsheet // later in the\x97? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yeah, yes. Yeah, one of the problems you\x92ve got is this restatement driven by the discontinued businesses makes prior period comparisons a little bit difficult. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Matt Robison - ', u'Ferris Baker & Watts - Analyst', u' ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Right, and the parts of your commercial business that seemed to perform according to your\nobjectives were the\x97 if I could read into that\x97 that much into it\x97 were the microwave signals business and the tower-mount amplifiers? Is that the right takeaway? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Both of those areas have actually stronger demand than we anticipated. So, from the\ndemand standpoint, those have definitely been there. We\x92re going up a ramp to increase our capacity in both areas, so that\x92s something we gave a very strong focus on. But yeah, those have been two very strong areas for us in the business.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Matt Robison -\n', u'Ferris Baker & Watts - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Does the fact\nthat the mismatch between your expectations on the PA side and the filter side and where you\x92re actually seeing the business, and\x97 in terms of total lower price? That just indicates that that\x92s where your pricing is more aggressive,\nso you\x92re addressing the demand on that basis or\x97 and what\x92s the\x97 are there measures you can take to cure that, or is it just moving people over to China? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yes. I think on tower amplifiers, the demand was pretty close to what we expected in\naggregate dollars. The mix was somewhat different, and that does change around during the quarter fairly significantly. So, the mix moved more during the quarter to two of the products, which at least one of those is in a ramp phase and is at lower\ngross margins. So, the answer to that is getting through the ramp more effectively and, as a result, getting to things like capped [sp] and housings [sp] and things that can help us reduce our costs significantly in the supply chain. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'From a filter standpoint, most of our volume\x97 or a majority of our volume comes out of\none customer. As I mentioned, we did not get through the full qualification to benefit last quarter with the materials in China. We did get through that during the quarter, but it was at the end of the quarter, and that will benefit us as we go into\nQ3. But, with the type of volumes we do there, that was a significant impact for us. It is also those two products, obviously, are in an area that we\x92re looking at selectivity and gross margins more closely as we attract additional business.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Matt Robison -\n', u'Ferris Baker & Watts - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'What\x92s your\ntake on the industry outlook on the commercial side for the next couple of quarters? ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President &\nCEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The demand remains strong as we look out over the next\ncouple quarters. I think the pricing pressure is going to remain there. I don\x92t necessarily see that going away as we progress through the quarter. But, I think on the commercial side, especially the tower-mounted amplifiers I think are really\npicking up in volume, ODUs, products and transceiver products for us, and I think power amplifiers and filters will remain healthy. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Matt Robison -', u' Ferris Baker & Watts - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Were those\x97 in those more buoyant areas, is that where you saw your bigger customers?\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter -\n', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'I\x92m not sure\nI understood that question. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Matt Robison - ', u'Ferris Baker & Watts - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'You said you have these 10% customers. Were they in the TMA, ODU and transceiver, or were they\x97? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x97No, no, the volumes aren\x92t significant enough there, and we have a variety of customers that wouldn\x92t have driven them into the top 10. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc.\n- - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'On the commercial side is amplifiers and filters.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Matt Robison -\n', u'Ferris Baker & Watts - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK, thanks a lot.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter -\n', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Thank you.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman -\n', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'One of the things you need to keep\nin mind, as Tom talked about early in his comments on that, is a lot of these cost reduction actions and\x97 given what he talked about in terms of the price of a base station coming down, these cost reduction actions are just necessary to keep,\nmaintain and improve your margins based on what\x92s going on on pricing. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Operator ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Before moving onto our next question, we would like to remind the phone audience that, if you have found that your question has been answered, we do ask that you please press the pound key to remove yourself from the\nquestion queue.

', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Naveen Niacon - ', u'Contra Partners - Analyst', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Thank you. These numbers are just a disaster. Why wouldn\x92t you\npre-release them with this operating loss? And I\x92m projecting break-even for this next quarter. Can you give me your forecast and your outlook on when you expect to achieve break-even? And finally, Tom, I think you should realign management and\nget proper controls here so this kind of stuff stops. This is quarter number God knows what in a row of this type of performance. Thank you. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK. I guess in response to one part of your question as far as pre-release, we didn\x92t\ngive any guidance for the quarter, so we saw no requirement to pre-release these. The revenue numbers were in the range that we had anticipated. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'There was enough discussion in the prior quarter, talk about the one-time items that happened in the first quarter, and we talked about the\npricing pressures and a lot of the things we\x92re seeing, as a lot of those\x97most of the challenges we\x92ve identified in this meeting. And so, I\x92m not sure how you got to a break-even projection, because that\x97you would not have\ndone that based upon the information we provided to you. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Operator ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our next question will come\nfrom Mark Jordan with A.G. Edwards. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Mark Jordan - ', u'A.G. Edwards - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Good afternoon, gentlemen. One question that I have is, in dealing with your customer base, obviously you\x92ve been in negative cash burn position for a while. You\x92re taking steps to sell relatively small pieces of your company.\nClearly, you\x92ve got one well-performing, very large asset in your defense piece, and that probably could be sold for a very significant amount of money. My question is, number one, are you experiencing concern in your customer base about the\nlong-term viability of REMEC, and any resistance to do business with you because of the tough recent history? And then, secondly, when you talk about looking at alternatives, is\x97 would you look at the sale of the defense business as a way of\nputting a very large slug of cash on the books to give you the financial elbow room to work through the next year? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yes. From a customer base, we haven\x92t seen any reluctance. We\x92ve, again, had healthy order intake from those customers on the\ncommercial side. You don\x92t work off of a large backlog of orders. Typically, you work off forecast, and those orders have continued to come in, so we haven\x92t seen any indication of that. Secondly, speaking of the defense business,\nit\x92s a healthy part of our business. We\x92re really driving to improve the performance of the commercial operation. We believe that we have enough cash to give us enough elbow room to move forward. It\x92s not a lot of elbow room but, at\nthis point, we believe that we have enough to move ourselves forward and do the appropriate things for the business. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Mark Jordan - ', u'A.G. Edwards - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Do you have any generic goals with regards to when you think this company should be at a\x97 say, a cash-flow break-even operating basis\nand/or some measure of profitability? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yes. We have been very reluctant to give guidance going forward. We\x92re not going to really give any formal guidance at this meeting. We have very strong internal goals, as you can see, to right the ship and, as we move through the end\nof this fiscal year to be in a much closer position to EBITDA break even so that the cash burn pretty much is behind us, and then with these additional asset sales, and we\x92ve got that elbow room to maneuver going into next fiscal year.\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Mark Jordan - ', u'A.G. Edwards - Analyst', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK. A final question addressing the absolute level of R&D right now.\nEven at this quarter with the reduction you\x92ve had, you\x92re still at a $42m a year run rate. Is that full spend level truly necessary for a company that\x92s being focused more and more narrowly as you get rid of other assets? And if so,\nwhere can you drive that R&D number down to and still spend money where you need to? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yes. With that scenario, as I mentioned, we\x92re looking at just as we are implementing these lean concepts in the manufacturing process side. We\x92re also now\nstarting that evaluation in the design engineering side. We do believe there\x92s some efficiencies we can gain there. Some of the costs in there are related to the transition of new products into the manufacturing arena from the design group, so\nas we get through some of these major moves from Finland to China and through some of the significant ramps we\x92ve been going through with some of our new customers, that will come down without negatively impacting our ability to design new\nproducts. So, we\x92re looking at\x97 really at two aspects, the efficiency of our design teams overall and our satellite facilities, and also the reduction of the cost to bring new products from design engineering into manufacturing.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Mark Jordan -\n', u'A.G. Edwards - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'A final question. The\ntransition from Finland has been very long, longer than anyone would have assumed. When can you say that that would be 98 or 99% complete? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'From a manufacturing standpoint, it\x92s 95 or 98% complete at this point, and we\x92ve\njust, in the end of this last quarter, have gotten the approval by one of our major customers on the material purchases in China. So, both from a supply chain and a manufacturing standpoint, we\x92re pretty well within that range you just asked\nabout. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman -\n', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'There will still be some costs in\nQ3 that remain duplicate on that, which will negatively impact our gross margin. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Operator ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Next, we\x92ll hear from Justin Martos [sp] with Grand [sp] Partners. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Justin Martos - ', u'Grand Partners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Couple questions. On the revenue side, you explained about 1.4m in revenue because of this\x97 it sounds like because you didn\x92t get the Chinese thing in place.\nWhat about the other 8m? Was that just pricing pressure, or was their volume just light in that part of the\x97? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\x97Well, in the\x97 the change in sales levels? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Justin Martos - ', u'Grand Partners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yes. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The other came about from pulling the discontinued businesses out of our\nrevenue line. There was about $6mof discontinued businesses and sales that occurred during the quarter. The sales were not picked up because you only pick up the operating income or loss on the discontinued line in your income statement. ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Justin Martos - ', u'Grand\nPartners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'So, 6m discontinued and 1.4m\x97?\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman -\n', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x97Yes. The sales on a restated\nbasis were within $1m of each other quarter to quarter, and if you look at them the way we were in the first quarter, they\x92re pretty close to the same number. We\x92re down a little bit, but not significantly. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Justin Martos - ', u'Grand Partners\n- - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'And then, the difference\x97 and then with the\ngross margin, what\x92s the\x97 is it just\x97 was that just absolute pricing pressure? And, to the manufacturing not being qualified hit on the gross margins\x97 within the cog side absolute dollar-wise? I mean, was it - it sounds like it\nwas five. I mean, is it really five? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'I\ndon\x92t have the exact number for you, Justin. I\x92ll\x97 we\x92ll take a look at it, and\x97 but I don\x92t have an exact number in terms of kind of\x97 some on the duplicate\x97 some of the duplicate costs ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Justin Martos - ', u'Grand Partners\n- - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Right. Were the businesses that were taken out the\nsix\x97 the approximate 6m, were they higher gross profit than the company was in the April quarter? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'It would be average or maybe just a little bit higher than average. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yeah. They tend to be a little bit higher than average. One of the reason for we\x92ve been doing that with both those\x97 one of the\nreason we sold those businesses\x97 well, two reasons. One, they\x92re non-core, and secondly, to do anything with them required a fairly significant R&D investment in both cases, and it just\x97 given the focus on driving profitability\nand getting focused on our core businesses, it just didn\x92t seem like the prudent thing to do. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Justin Martos - ', u'Grand Partners - Analyst', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Right, right, OK. And then\x97 OK. So, really, it sounds like on\nthe\x97 and the reason you\x92ve done the wireless charge on the wireless infrastructure side, that is really because the gross profit margins in there, they must be\x97 can you just give us a range, because it sounds like defense gross\nmargins continue to do well, but the wireless infrastructure\x97. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x97Well, when you got done with everything, the wireless gross margins were below 5%. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Justin Martos - ', u'Grand Partners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Right. And then\x97 OK, thank you very much. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc.\n- - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Thanks. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Operator ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Next, we\x92ll hear from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Rich Valera - ', u'Needham &\nCompany - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Thanks. Winston, have you said what the line\nitem from discontinued ops was during the quarter that will be on the income statement? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yes. It just\x97 it says just that. It says\x97 if you go to\x97 did you guys get a copy of our financial statement? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Rich Valera - ', u'Needham &\nCompany - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'No, we don\x92t have any income statement\nor balance sheet. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston\nHickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'You got the press\nrelease, right? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Rich\nValera - ', u'Needham & Company - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Right, but\nthere\x92s no income statement or balance sheet. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We apologize for that. The short turnaround time, in terms of reporting, coupled with a holiday just really put our backs against the wall. But if you go to the income statement\x97 hang on just a second\x97\nyou\x92ve got\x97 just before you get down to your net loss, there\x92s a line called\x97 it\x92s \x93Loss From Discontinued Operations Net Of Tax.\x94 And that number with 1/2m in the current quarter and, for the six months ended July\n30th, it was ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'423,000, which means we made about $77,000 on those two businesses in the first quarter. And then, if you go to the\nbalance sheet, it\x92s going to be in the asset section, because what you do there is you just net asset from liability. And just\x97 on the line just before other current assets in your current assets section, there\x92s a line called\n\x93Net Assets Of Discontinued Operations,\x94 and that was $8.8m at the end of July, and it was $11m at the end of January. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Rich Valera - ', u'Needham & Company - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK, and I think you alluded to this, but could you give the specific gross margins in each segment for wireless and for defense? ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC,\nInc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'They were in the high 20s for defense and less than\nfive for commercial. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Rich\nValera - ', u'Needham & Company - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'And all of\nthe 4m roughly of\x97 sort of non-recurring charges and cogs, those were all in wireless? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yes. There was virtually nothing in defense. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Rich Valera - ', u'Needham & Company - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK. And within your prepared remarks, you mentioned\x97 and this sort of goes back to a previous question. You mentioned that you expected\nsignificant additional cash from strategic initiatives. And in all your previous deals, you\x92ve got your below single digit type of cash from the sales, and I think this most recent one is 3m. What would result in significant additional cash\nfrom these sales? Are we talking like\x97? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc.- CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x97Keep in mind, what we\x92ve done is we\x92ve sold some very small businesses to this point, it and as we look at our business mix, we\x92ve got the\x97 we will get more cash out of\x97 we\x92ll get\nsignificantly more cash out of the other business that we have up for sale, and some of the others that we\x92re considering will be a lot more cash than the $3m we\x92ve talked about. So, significant is a little bit in the eyes of the beholder,\nbut\x97. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Rich Valera -\n', u'Needham & Company - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x97But in the one\nthat you think was\x97 is going to close any time now\x97. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc.- CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x97They\x92ll be well above 3m. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Rich Valera - ', u'Needham & Company - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Well above 3m, OK. And just trying to hone in on this Asian\x97 the supply chain issue for your largest OEM customer that\x92s\ntransitioning from Finland to China, you sort of alluded to this costing you a significant amount of money several times. I\x92m just trying to get an idea of sort of, now that you\x92re qualified, can we have any sense of how much that saves\nyou going forward? You mentioned the 1.4m pressure on revenue from\x97. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x97I think, Rich, that\x92s something we should do for you in\nthe\x97 at the end of Q3 because we\x92ve still got some carryover items and some things like that, and that\x97 we will\x97 we should be\x97 when we report the Q3 results, we\x92ll be very, very clean on that, and I\x92d be a little\nbit reluctant to get too detailed on that because of we\x92re balancing a number of pieces. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Rich Valera - ', u'Needham & Company - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Sure. On your op-ex, I think you broke out pretty much what was sort of non-recurring in cogs. How much on your op-ex would you say was non-recurring? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc.\n- - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Probably $1m. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Rich Valera - ', u'Needham &\nCompany - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'One million dollars total? OK. And so, I\nknow you\x92re kind of reluctant to do this, but would you hazard the trajectory of op-ex sequentially, given sort of continued\x97 so, you would suggest it\x92s down sequentially? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'It should come down a little bit. That would be my expectation. The S-OX program will go up,\nthe strategic items that we invest in will go down, and we\x92re talking a look at the op-ex as well as the other elements of our cost. So, we\x92re not predicting anything on that, but directionally, it should be down. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Rich Valera - ', u'Needham &\nCompany - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK. Finally, this is sort of a bigger\npicture question maybe for Tom, but I look at your\x97 I\x92ll give you the benefit of the doubt on the non-recurring stuff on your cogs line. You\x92ve got normalized gross margins of around\x97 overall gross margins around 12% this\nquarter. You need to get to 20%, by your own model to break even, assuming you\x92ve got 20 percent op-ex. That\x92s 800 basis points of improvement you need to basically enact here to get to break even, and I\x92m just\x97 I\x92m\nreally\x97 I\x92m hearing some things that should help by some amounts, but I\x92m just not hearing anything that sounds to me like 800 basis points of improvement. Am I missing something here, or is\x97 how do you do that? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. -\nPresident & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yes. The biggest opportunity, obviously,\nis in the direct material costs, and we\x92re spending in the neighborhood of $170m a year on materials. So we feel that we are not mature, from a supply chain basis. We\x92ve done a lot of work to reposition ourselves into Asia, especially\nChina, but we think there\x92s a lot of additional room there to bring our direct material costs down. And also, as Winston talked about during the call, his script was the logistics cost, because we had a lot of material moving between Finland\nand China, and that\x92s mostly behind us now. And our type of products, it\x92s a pretty heavy product and bulky, and it\x92s pretty expensive as far as shipping costs. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'So, the biggest area of opportunity is in the direct material. We do believe with lean and what we\x92ve seen, as I mentioned, we saw\ninitially with the initial lines that went in, about a 20% direct labor savings, space reduction, reduction in future purchases of capital because of the additional throughput there. So, it\x92s really going to be a combination of the lean, which\nbrings us efficiencies through the manufacturing process, reduces our capital needs going forward because of the end throughput and reduced cycle time, and then the supply chain reduction. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'But at the end of the day, Rich, you\x92re right. Eight hundred basis\npoints is a long ways to go. And as Tom talked about earlier, we are in an industry that has too much capacity. So, we\x92ve got to do these, and we\x92ve got to get our operating expenses and margins in line. I mean, that\x92s how your\nfinancial model works for you, and that\x92s\x97 and it includes a lot of things in looking at both the cost of sales side, pricing, as well as where we\x92re spending our operating expense dollars. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Operator ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Once again, just as a reminder to our phone audience, if you find that your question has\nbeen answered, please press the pound key to remove yourself from the question queue. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We\x92ll next go to Wes Cummins with B. Riley & Company. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Wes Cummins - ', u'B. Riley & Company - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Hey, good afternoon. Do you guys\x97 you mentioned in your prepared comments the only way that you see pricing pressure kind of abating in the industry is to refer the\nconsolidation. Are you guys going to wait around for that to happen, or are you guys looking to really enact that to really start to fix the industry? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Well, we\x92re\x97 obviously, the first move for us is to continue to improve our\ninternal fundamentals, and to really get a clear picture as we strip away some of these non-core assets, under-performing business lines where we can really take the business to, and that\x92s really the phase we\x92re in today. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Wes Cummins - ', u'B. Riley &\nCompany - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK. And what really is the issue for you\nguys\x92 gross margins? If I look at similar companies like Power Wave or Andrew that\x92s got\x97 maybe got a little bit better product mix, the\x97 their margins just on the commercial business alone are approaching 20%, and you guys are\nbelow five. I understand that the issues with China, those should be resolved. But if those get resolved, why shouldn\x92t we see gross margins approaching 20 in your commercial business by the fourth quarter? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc.\n- - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'You\x92ve got\x97 keep in mind, on Andrew,\nyou\x92ve got a lot of legacy business that\x92s holding their gross margins up, and I don\x92t\x97 I think the Power Wave is under 20, and the points have been well under 20. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Wes Cummins - ', u'B. Riley & Company - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Right, but they\x92re 19 last quarter. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc.\n- - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Right. If we execute to the improvement plans we have,\nthat should definitely move us in that direction. We also need to be more selective than we have in the past with the business we bring on, and we\x92re living through some of that now. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Wes Cummins - ', u'B. Riley & Company - Analyst', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK. Couple of other things. In your press release, you pointed out\nspecifically that you guys have hired a financial advisor to consider the sale of additional business units. I mean, it\x92s been fairly well known that you guys were going to sell two of the units. Did you point this out because you\x92re\nlooking at selling some bigger pieces of the business? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Well, initially, the units that we sold off were quite small, very low revenue, and pretty heavy investments in R&D and other operating expenses. As Winston mentioned, the revenue generation of some of these\nnon-core businesses we\x92re looking at right now are getting larger in the revenue area, and we\x92ve brought in advisors and help to support us in that area as these business units have gotten larger and more substantial part of our total\nbusiness. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Wes Cummins -\n', u'B. Riley & Company - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'How many more\nnon-core business units do you have? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We just have a couple, what I would consider a couple more non-core business units. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Wes Cummins - ', u'B. Riley & Company - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Have you guys considered selling any of the commercial wireless businesses, the ones that\x97 your amplifier, filter or TMA businesses? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. -\nPresident & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We have not today looked at selling those\nindividual units. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Wes\nCummins - ', u'B. Riley & Company - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK, and\nwould you guys\x97 would you completely rule out selling the defense business? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yes. As I think was mentioned in previous conference calls, we\x92re looking at all aspects of bringing value to our shareholders, so I don\x92t think at this stage\nwe would say we\x92re ruling anything out. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Wes Cummins - ', u'B. Riley & Company - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK, thanks. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Operator ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'And we\x92ll next take a question from Kevin Dede with Merriman. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Kevin Dede - ', u'Merriman Curhan\nFord & Co. - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Guys, thanks for taking my questions.\nTom, would you mind sort of characterizing the pricing environment and the trends that you\x92re seeing from, say, the fourth quarter or the first quarter and this quarter, current quarter? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. -\nPresident & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yes, Kevin. I\x97 you know, as I\nmentioned, it remains pretty brutal out there from a pricing standpoint. I believe that, internally, we have processes in place today, which I\x92m involved in a majority of, of reviewing them. We\x92re being much more selective in bids we\nrespond to out there, and are, obviously, less anxious to fill up factories, etc., because we\x92re at a pretty reasonable capacity level in those factories. So, I\x92d say that the environment is still pretty brutal, from pricing standpoint, I\ndo believe in the last quarters, so we have gotten more selective and have a much better process in place to evaluate what we go after in the market. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Kevin Dede - ', u'Merriman Curhan Ford & Co. - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'So, in your mind, do you think the environment is stabilizing, or are you just being more\ncareful? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter -\n', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'I would say it has\nsomewhat stabilized, and we\x92re being more careful. It is\x97 it fluctuates in different areas as far as the intensity, but I\x92d say, across the entire base, it has become more stable. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Kevin Dede - ', u'Merriman Curhan\nFord & Co. - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Can you tell us\x97 I mean, you\nalluded, or at least Winston did, to perhaps being finished up with the transfer in the third quarter, being able to give us more insight to what expenses will look like during the fourth quarter. Can we assume, then, that that transition should be\ncomplete this quarter? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Are you talking about the Finland? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Kevin Dede - ', u'Merriman Curhan Ford & Co. - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'From Finland? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The manufacturing portion, yes. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Kevin Dede - ', u'Merriman Curhan Ford & Co. - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK. Are there plans to perhaps consolidate Costa Rica and Philippines into China, or further consolidation on the manufacturing side?\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President &\nCEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We don\x92t have firm plans to do that today. We are\ntransitioning some products out of those sites, especially I know in Costa Rica, some products into China as they get into a more mature phase and we start to bring up potentially products beyond the filter products in China. That is part of the\nroadmap we\x92re on today. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'As\nTom indicated in his earlier comments, we\x92re looking at perhaps out\x97 does it make sense financially to outsource some of these more mature products. And also, as we talked, when Bob was\x97 in our earlier conversations, Bob has indicated\nthat we do need to look at whether or not we have too many factories, and that\x92s one of the things we\x92re looking at. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Kevin Dede - ', u'Merriman Curhan Ford & Co. - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'All right. You posted really nice growth in your defense business. Can you give us any\ninsight on how we might expect to see that going forward, future bids on projects coming up, where your current contracts stand in terms of their completion? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'You know, as we said, we have a very healthy backlog. Most of those are products that are\nmulti-year types of contracts and deliveries, unless we have a performance failure, and our team in the defense side has been pretty flawless on that aspect as far as quality and meeting customer commitments. So, we have a good visibility, based on\nthe backlog, and many of those contracts extend out for a number of years, so we\x92re feeling pretty comfortable with that situation today. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Kevin Dede - ', u'Merriman Curhan Ford & Co. - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'How about new ones coming up? Where do you think you stand in terms of winning new projects\nas they come to you? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom\nWaechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yes. I\nthink our win rate is quite healthy and has remained healthy. I haven\x92t seen that change\x97 any significant change in that metric as we\x92ve progressed through the year. I think we\x97 as we go after opportunities, the win rate has been\nquite high for us, and it continues to be that way. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Kevin Dede - ', u'Merriman Curhan Ford & Co. - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Can you give us an idea\x97? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x97 They tend to announce, Kevin, a handful of key wins during the year as we go through. It would be inappropriate for us to comment on anything that\x92s kind of\nforward-looking because it\x92s in the future, but it\x92s\x97 they tend to have the few, and then they have a fair number of smaller wins that are really critical to the seed planting for product business that\x92s going to be coming down\nthe road in one year, two years. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Kevin Dede - ', u'Merriman Curhan Ford & Co. - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK. Can you just give us a read on capacity utilization at your three commercial plants and your San Diego business? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President &\nCEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yes. We\x92re in the three offshore wireless facilities.\nWe\x92re above 75%, majority of the time in the 80% type of range. I would say in our local defense-oriented manufacturing, it tends to run even a little bit higher than that. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Kevin Dede - ', u'Merriman Curhan Ford & Co. - Analyst', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Great. Thanks a lot for taking my questions, guys. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. -\nPresident & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Thanks, Kevin. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Operator ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Next, we\x92ll hear from Eric Aguire [sp] with Camelback Research Alliance. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Eric Aguire - ', u'Camelback\nResearch Alliance - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Hi. My first question is with\nrespect to the non-cash charges. Of the 62.4m in charges, how much relates to the lines of business acquired from Spectrian? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'None. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Eric Aguire - ', u'Camelback Research Alliance - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Zero? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Zero. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Eric Aguire - ', u'Camelback Research Alliance - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'OK. My next question is for Tom. How do you envision your experiences from Spectrian will benefit you leading the company going forward? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. -\nPresident & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Well, I have had, with Spectrian,\nextensive experience in the power amplifier side of the business, which had\x97 really is at the heart of the RF conditioning products and our fastest-growing product line for us today, so I think that\x92s a very direct experience, and also the\ncustomer base mirrors very closely the customer base we have here at REMEC. So I think also we did a lot of outsourcing of manufacturing at Spectrian, and if we do choose to outsource some of our more mature products as we go forward, I think we\nhave a pretty good roadmap of how to do that. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Eric Aguire - ', u'Camelback Research Alliance -\nAnalyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK. Lastly, just curious as to what the motivation was\nbehind the exchange of the employee options for restricted stock. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yes. The main motivation was to keep employees motivated and focused during a pretty critical period. I think in our industry, where the entire industry is taking a\npretty big hit over the last three years and stock values have decreased pretty significantly during that time, we have a number of employees that were way under water on their stock options, and I think this is a way to give them some motivation to\ndrive for the improvement of the company going forward. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Operator ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our next question will come\nfrom Steven Hanson [sp] with Millennium Partners. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Ted Wachel - ', u'Millennium Partners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Hi. This is Ted Wachel [sp]. You mentioned that you had two non-core businesses that you have up for sale. I suspect that those are the two businesses that you\x92ve hired an outside advisor on. If not, I\x92d\nlike to clarify that. And can you just walk through what those two businesses are that you view as non-core at this point? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'The one\x97 we had two businesses up for sale. One actually closed in August. That was our nano-wave business that was based in Toronto and was actually part of our\ndefense and space operation. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Ted Wachel - ', u'Millennium Partners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'And that\x92s where you were paid 3m? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Three million plus notes. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Ted Wachel - ', u'Millennium Partners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Right. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK, and the other business we have not named. We do have a letter of intent, but we don\x92t feel it\x92s appropriate to name that business until we actually get into a definitive agreement\x97 arrangement with\nthe potential buyer. There\x92s one sold and one that we have an LOI on today. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Ted Wachel - ', u'Millennium Partners - Analyst', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK, but you said you have retained an outside advisor to analyze\nstrategic alternatives relative to some of your business units. What are you referring to then? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'So they are helping us with that business unit that we have an LOI on today, and then we are looking at other business units within our total organization to see if it\nmakes sense to continue in those product lines or not. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Ted Wachel - ', u'Millennium Partners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK, and so none of that refers to the defense business, correct? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter ', u'- REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Well, as we look at ourselves strategically, we\x92re looking at all aspects of the business. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Ted Wachel ', u'- Millennium Partners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK, last question. You talk about a need to execute on the plans. Do you feel that you\nexecuted on your plans during the latest quarter, or did you fail to execute on your plans during the latest quarter? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'I believe we executed on our plans except for the qualification of Chinese material for one of our major filter companies. That drug out\nbeyond, I think, any of our expectations, so we did not perform well in that particular area. The rest I think we\x92ve met our expectations. On the lean manufacturing, as I mentioned, we\x92ve exceeded it. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Operator ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Our next question will come from Oscar Wilson [sp] with Ardmore Partners [sp]. ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Oscar Wilson - ', u'Ardmore\nPartners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Hey, good afternoon. Can you tell me what\nthe operating cash flow was in the quarter? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yes, it was about 8m negative. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Oscar Wilson - ', u'Ardmore Partners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK. Well, the cash \x97 how much did the cash account change in the quarter? ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Eight million dollars. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Oscar Wilson - ', u'Ardmore\nPartners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Because you also had a sale leaseback of 4m\nin the quarter. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston\nHickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'No. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Oscar Wilson - ', u'Ardmore\nPartners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK. Was that in the previous quarter?\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman -\n', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'No. We didn\x92t do a sale\nleaseback. In the previous quarter we had a sale. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Oscar Wilson - ', u'Ardmore Partners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'For your finished facility? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'On the building. That was in the previous\x97 that was in the first quarter. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Oscar Wilson - ', u'Ardmore Partners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK, OK. Can you tell me exactly how much zero cost inventory you guys have left, and do you expect to continue to sell that? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc.\n- - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We haven\x92t released any specific amounts. It would\nbe inappropriate to do that. But, we have\x97 we don\x92t have a lot, and the problem becomes, Oscar, is that that inventory tends to be fairly old, and the longer you have it, the more whiskers it gets on it. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Oscar Wilson - ', u'Ardmore\nPartners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK, but there\x92s\x97 do you expect\nnext quarter to have\x97? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x97 We\x92ll have some. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President &\nCEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yes. There is inventory of zero value that we will sell\nover the next couple quarters. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'But\nI wouldn\x92t expect it to be a large number. And that was\x97 it\x92s been a $1/2m in each of the quarters. In round numbers, it\x92s been $1/2m in the first and second quarter, and it could be twice that, or it just depends. A lot depends\non the specific customers, on what their needs are, too because it doesn\x92t fit with every operator. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Oscar Wilson - ', u'Ardmore Partners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK, OK. And are you\x97 you guys are not giving guidance for next quarter, is that correct? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'That\x92s correct. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Oscar Wilson - ', u'Ardmore Partners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'When do you expect to start giving guidance again? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc.\n- - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Well, what we hope to do in this call, and I think\nwe\x92ve done a little bit of that, is to give you some directional input on where\x97 on the direction things are going, but we\x92re going to evaluate that on a quarter by quarter basis. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Oscar Wilson - ', u'Ardmore\nPartners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Why is it that you feel like you can\x92t\ngive guidance? I mean, are there\x97 what are the factors that you feel like you can\x92t accurately predict? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'One of the major factors that I talked about during the call is the pretty dramatic range of margins we get in some of our major product\nlines. And as the mix changes during the quarter, typically the aggregate dollars and revenue are pretty close to what has been planned, but the mix changes pretty dramatically, and we\x92re trying to close the gap on those variations, and also as\nwe strip away some of these non-core business and activities, I think we\x92re getting a much better feel from what we can actually do going forward. And until we have much better grasp on that, we don\x92t feel it\x92s appropriate to give the\nguidance. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman\n- - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'And the other thing that\nhappens, Oscar, is you look at this quarter, for example. As we go through and take these profit improvement actions, we keep coming up with not necessarily the large, but some\x97 the cost of some cleanup kinds of things, too. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Oscar Wilson - ', u'Ardmore Partners - Analyst', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'I mean, I\x92m just concerned as an analyst looking at this company, I\nwant to be able to get some sense of what\x92s going to happen in the near term, and if you guys don\x92t have any kind of satellite on that, it\x92s just\x97. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x97No, we have a view. The fact that\x97. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Oscar Wilson - ', u'Ardmore\nPartners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x97But you\x92re no\x97? ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC,\nInc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x97The fact\x97 yes, but that we\x92re just,\nfor reasons previously expressed, we\x92re just reluctant to give that. We think it\x92s appropriate that we give you some directional kinds of things, which we\x92ll attempt to do more, but we don\x92t believe it\x92s appropriate that we\ngive you this we\x92re going to hit this number. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Oscar Wilson - ', u'Ardmore Partners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Well, what about sort of longer-term targets, like will you expect to be cash-flow positive by this time next year, or expect to be profitable by this time next year? I mean, just\x97 we need to have some way of\nevaluating your performance against something. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'I think that\x92s a fair comment, and we\x92ll take that under advisement. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Oscar Wilson - ', u'Ardmore Partners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK, thank you. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Thanks. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Operator ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'And gentlemen, we do have a question from Andrew Mathis [sp] with Mathis [sp] Capital Management. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Andrew Mathis - ', u'Mathis Capital Management - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Hi, guys. I had a couple quick housekeeping items since we don\x92t have a balance sheet.\nI was wondering, could you give us the reserve numbers for inventory, warranty and receivables? ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'See, where have I got that? The inventory number is in the high teens.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Andrew Mathis -\n', u'Mathis Capital Management - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'High teens, OK.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman -\n', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The receivables number is in the\nmid-single digits, and the warranty number is in the high single digits. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Andrew Mathis - ', u'Mathis Capital Management - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'OK, high single digits. Also wondered, you alluded to kind of lower cap-ex. I was wondering if you could put a number on that. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc.\n- - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'You mean for the quarter or go-forward? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Andrew Mathis - ', u'Mathis Capital\nManagement - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Both, if you could. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. -\nPresident & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The quarter was approximately 3.5m, which\nwas down, I believe, a little bit more than a million from the previous quarter. Our expectations when we went into the year that we would have spent probably at least twice that in the first half of the year, so I think the biggest factor for us\ntoday in order to keep that at that type of level is the benefits we get out of the lean manufacturing. The initial implementation looks very promising. We\x92re not far enough along with it in the Philippines and Chinese factors, I think today,\nto have full confidence that we\x92re going to be able to keep at the same levels we were in the first half of the year. I believe that the capital spend will be at least what we spent in the first half of the year, probably more. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc.\n- - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The other thing we got, too, Andrew, is we\x92re\nlooking at some facility kinds of things that we may have to do for defense and, if that\x92s the case, that will\x97 that could impact our capital expenditures in the second half of the year. So, that would be a one-time anomaly. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Andrew Mathis - ', u'Mathis Capital\nManagement - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'And how big might that be? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. -\nPresident & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'That would hit in the fourth quarter, and\nit would be\x97. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x97Several million dollars. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President &\nCEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yes, It would be a little bit below 2m. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Andrew Mathis - ', u'Mathis Capital\nManagement - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK, because I remember in the 10-Q you\nsaid you might\x97 capital expenditures may continue to be significant as a result of their pure expansion to international production facilities, so you\x97. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x97Yes. We\x92re pretty well built-out in the facilities. We have one additional\nproduct line that\x92s going into China right now that we\x92ve\x97 was part of the capital expenditures we saw here, and then, as I mentioned, we are under capacity in the ODU line and, to some degree, the TMA line. I think the ODU line is\none that will be the most capital-intensive as far as getting that capacity ramp. So, most of the factories are built out now. It\x92s a matter of how much throughput we can get through, then the capital there. There will be some additional spend\nfor the ramp on the ODU products, the microwave products, and additional line going into China right now. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We\x92ve also had, as Tom alluded to in his comments earlier, we\x92ve had good success of moving inventory from around\x97 excuse me\x97 capital around to avoid\nthat, so we\x92ve got a much better\x97 we\x92ve had a lot more success in the balancing of our test equipment and other fixed asset requirements than we anticipated we\x92d have when we entered the year. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Andrew Mathis - ', u'Mathis Capital\nManagement - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Right, OK. So, what were the proceeds? I\nbelieve you did sell a couple of things during the quarter. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We only sold\x97 well, we did not sell anything during the quarter. We sold the nano-wave business, but that occurred after the quarter was over. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'So we did not recognize that in our income statement or in our cash. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc.\n- - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'It happened in the latter part of August when we\nactually finalized the deal. It will show up in our third quarter, but not our second quarter. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Andrew Mathis - ', u'Mathis Capital Management - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'And also, in your new line of credit, I was wondering if there\x92s any covenants that you might be kind of close\x97. ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x97Yeah. I mean, there\x92s a quick ratio covenant, and then\nthere\x92s also a net\x97 tangible net worth covenant. The goodwill, as you know, does not affect it. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Andrew Mathis - ', u'Mathis Capital Management - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Right, that doesn\x92t matter. And what is the tangible goodwill covenant? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We\x92ve got quite a bit of headroom on it. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Andrew Mathis - ', u'Mathis Capital\nManagement - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK, thank you very much. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. -\nPresident & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Thanks. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Operator ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'We\x92ll go back to Justin Martos with Grand Partners. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Justin Martos - ', u'Grand Partners\n- - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yeah, I just had a follow-up. So, on the gross\nprofit, you have a $4m charge on the\x97 within there, or was it\x97 is there anything else? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'That was in the non-recurring items we talked about. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Justin Martos - ', u'Grand Partners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'And\x97 I\x92m sorry, it\x92s just because the income\x97 I think the press release is slow in coming out. But basically, when you\nadjust for the non-recurring type things, where are you coming in on a\x97? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x97Well, if you did the $4m, I mean, that\x92s four points by itself, and it\x92s\x97 what we haven\x92t talked about, which we haven\x92t quantified, is\nsome of the other\x97 is the accumulation of some of the other costs that we\x92ve got, the duplicate Finland and logistics and some other things. We will do a better job of that for you in the Q3 report. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Justin Martos - ', u'Grand Partners\n- - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'So, in the next\x97 and basically, could that be\nsignificant? We\x92re talking greater than $1m on that? ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Oh, yes. I mean, it\x92s\x97 yeah, we\x92re talking\x97 I\ndon\x92t know that it\x92s four points, but it\x92s several points. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Justin Martos - ', u'Grand Partners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Great. And then, in the defense business, sequentially, was it\x97 on an absolute dollar basis, was it actually down? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc.\n- - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'No. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Justin Martos - ', u'Grand Partners\n- - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'So it was up? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. -\nPresident & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Yes, it was up quarter-on-quarter.\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Justin Martos -\n', u'Grand Partners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Because the thing\x97 in\nthe things you sold, you have not actually\x97 they were not defense-related, is that correct? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Well, yeah. The nano-wave business was defense, but it wasn\x92t helping them. It helped them in the first quarter profitability. Remember, we said we had $2.7m\x97\n1.7m worth of one-time good news in the first quarter? Both of those came from the defense business. Now, that did not recur, but the gross margins on the ongoing business was up modestly from where it was in the first quarter. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Justin Martos - ', u'Grand Partners\n- - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'The gross margins were? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc.\n- - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'As well as the bottom line number. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Justin Martos - ', u'Grand Partners\n- - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK, but on an absolute dollar sales, defense\nwas\x97? ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u'\n', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x97Not materially different. Up a little bit. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Justin Martos - ', u'Grand Partners\n- - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Up sequentially? ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. -\nPresident & CEO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Hang on. They\x92re up\nquarter-to-quarter if you back out the nano-wave out of Q1 and Q2. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Justin Martos - ', u'Grand Partners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Oh, so if you back out the nano-wave, which you sold after the end of the August quarter, that\x92s how you\x92re looking at to say it was up, right? Because if you\nhave the nano-wave, then that would be\x97. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Winston Hickman - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - CFO', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'\x97Including the nano-wave, we were up slightly, and if\x97 excluding nano-wave, the continuing business is up almost $1m in sales. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Justin Martos - ', u'Grand Partners - Analyst', u' ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK, thank you. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Operator ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. ', u' ', u'\xa0', u' ', u'Tom Waechter - ', u'REMEC, Inc. - President & CEO', u' ', u'\n', u'\xa0', u' ', u'OK, I would like to thank you for continued interest in REMEC, and we\x92ll talk to you\nagain next quarter.
