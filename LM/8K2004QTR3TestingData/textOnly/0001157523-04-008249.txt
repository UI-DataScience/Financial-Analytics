Software license revenue was $1.5 million, reflecting a 20\npercent increase over the prior quarter and a 218 percent increase\nover the same quarter last year. Gross margin also continued to\nimprove, rising to 68 percent, up from 67 percent in the prior\nquarter, and 60 percent a year ago.\n    On the bottom line, Versata\'s $1.1 million, or $0.13 per share,\nGAAP net loss was slightly higher than its second quarter net loss of\n$880,000, or $0.11 per share, and less than one-third of the $3.8\nmillion, or $0.51 per share, loss in the prior year period.\nContributing in part to the quarter\'s GAAP net loss were approximately\n$645,000 in restructuring and other costs primarily related to\nVersata\'s write-down of certain leasehold improvements associated with\nthe headquarters\' lease restructure completed last quarter. The\nnon-GAAP net loss for the third quarter, which excludes these charges,\nwas $316,000, or $0.04 per share, substantially better than the\n$879,000, or $0.11 per share, net loss during the second quarter and\nthe $1.4 million, or $0.19 per share, net loss in the prior year\nperiod.\n    Versata reduced its cash burn by 42 percent, to $452,000 this\nquarter from $784,000 last quarter. Versata ended the third quarter\nwith $10.3 million in cash and short-term investments.\n    "We made a lot of progress on several fronts during the third\nquarter and I\'m personally very proud of our team\'s achievements,"\nsaid Alan Baratz, CEO and president of Versata. "Although much work\nremains, I believe our emphasis on operational, product and service\nexcellence will continue to serve us well."\n\n    Customers\n\n    During the quarter, Versata sold new products and services to\nseveral of its existing customers, including Equifax, GAD, IBM and the\nState of Utah.\n    Also aiding sales were key customers who deployed new applications\nthat they have been developing on the Versata platform. Among this\ngroup is Equifax. An information services provider, Equifax in the\nthird quarter deployed to one client an application that automates the\nprocess of extending credit and processing loans. This required\nEquifax to purchase new Versata run-time licenses. As more Equifax\ncustomers choose to use the new application, we expect that Equifax\nwill purchase additional Versata licenses.\n\n    Products\n\n    Versata made two key enhancements to its products during the third\nquarter. First, the company shipped the Versata Logic Suite for the\nopen source JBoss application server. Second, Versata certified its\nsoftware for the WebSphere platform for the IBM eServer iSeries\nservers.\n    Versata also recently enhanced its engineering capacity with the\naddition of a team of seven talented developers, most of who are based\nin Nova Scotia, Canada. Their depth of experience as a group includes\nseveral decades of enterprise software development, including senior\nroles in the creation of the BEA WebLogic Integration product.\n    Finally, with its newly expanded engineering team, the company has\nbeen able to begin work on Versata Logic Suite 6.0, its next major\nsoftware release. Versata Logic Suite 6.0 is being designed to provide\ndevelopers with several key enhancements, including improved workflow,\naccess to tools based on the open source Eclipse project, business\nactivity monitoring using executive dashboards, and new features for\nbusiness process management.\n\n    Quarterly Conference Call\n\n    Versata will host its quarterly conference call, open to all\ninterested parties, at 2:00 p.m. (PDT), 5:00 p.m. (EDT), today. The\ncall will be available over the Internet at www.versata.com.\n\n    Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Regulation G)\n\n    Versata uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures to report\nits financial results. Management believes that these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures provide an additional tool for investors to\nevaluate on-going operating results and trends excluding certain\nitems. Versata has historically included non-GAAP financial measures\nwhen reporting to the investment community and therefore believes the\ninclusion of certain non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency\nand comparability with past financial reports. However, non-GAAP\nfinancial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a\nsubstitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with\nGAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used within our earnings press\nrelease exclude expenses for: stock-based compensation, amortization\nof intangibles and restructuring and other. Investors are encouraged\nto review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to\ntheir most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as provided in\nthe financial tables attached.\n\n    About Versata\n\n    Versata provides solutions for automating and simplifying the\nbuilding, maintenance and ongoing evolution of large, complex,\ndata-intensive enterprise applications. These applications typically\naccess multiple data sources, incorporate multiple database tables and\nuser interfaces, execute very complex business transactions and\nsupport thousands of users. The Versata solution effectively and\nefficiently replaces time intensive hand-coding efforts with simple,\nintuitive business rules and graphical process flow specification.\n    Versata Global 2000 customers include American Management Systems,\nBritish Telecommunications, JP Morgan Chase & Co., Meridian Health\nCare Management and Union Bank of California.
