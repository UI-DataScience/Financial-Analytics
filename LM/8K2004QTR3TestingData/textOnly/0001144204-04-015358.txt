LAWSON, PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN, 21ST CENTURY HOLDING COMPANY\n(954) 308-1257 OR (954) 581-9993\n\n\n                      21ST CENTURY HOLDING COMPANY REPORTS\n                           LOSSES FOR HURRICANE JEANNE\n                              AND FORWARD GUIDANCE\n\n         PLANTATION, FLORIDA, SEPTEMBER 27, 2004 - EDWARD J. (TED) LAWSON,\nPRESIDENT & CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF 21ST CENTURY HOLDING COMPANY (NASDAQ:\nTCHC), comments about Federated National Insurance Company, a subsidiary of 21st\nCentury, "First and foremost we would like to assure all of our policyholders\nthat were affected by Hurricane Jeanne that our adjusters are in the stricken\narea and working hard to help take care of them. Our claim lines are open 24\nhours a day, 7 days a week. Our offices are staffed and we are responding to our\npolicyholders needs."\n\n         Mr. Lawson continued, "First of all, as with the other storms this\nseason, this hurricane should not impair Federated National or its ability to\nwrite business in the future. We believe Federated National has enough\nreinsurance in place to handle this storm. American Vehicle, our other insurance\nsubsidiary, writes general liability and personal auto insurance and will not be\naffected.\n\n         After an unprecedented four major hurricanes, Mother Nature has reduced\nour estimated earnings for 2004 down to approximately break even. Guidance for\n2005 however, will remain the same at approximately $2.67 per share (post stock\nsplit).\n\n         The Company is presently exploring alternatives to reduce its exposure\nto these types of storms. Although these measures may increase operating\nexpenses, management believes that they will protect long-term profitability. A\nbasic insurance company\'s function is to spread the risk among a group of common\ninterest parties (such as homeowners) but those parties, over time, must bear\nthe risk. At the appropriate time we will need to file for rate relief. However,\nright now our emphasis is on our insureds, as it should be. We will be reporting\nour third quarter earnings around November 10th and will have a conference call\nat that time."\n\nABOUT THE COMPANY\n\n         The Company, through its subsidiaries, underwrites standard and\nnon-standard personal automobile insurance, flood insurance, general liability\ninsurance, mobile home insurance and homeowners\' property and casualty insurance\nin the State of Florida. The Company underwrites general liability and\nhomeowners insurance as an admitted carrier in the State of Louisiana. The\nCompany also operates as an approved (non-admitted) carrier in the State of\nGeorgia underwriting general liability coverage for contractors, mercantile\nclasses and special events. In addition, the Company has underwriting authority\nand processes claims for third party insurance companies. In addition to\ninsurance services, the Company offers premium finance services to its insureds\nas well as insureds of certain third party insurance companies. Lastly, the\nCompany offers other ancillary services including licensing of its tax\npreparation software products, electronic income tax filing, tax preparation,\nand automobile tag and title transfer services.\n\n         The Company offers single and master franchise opportunities to\nindividuals through its subsidiaries, Fed USA Insurance/Financial Services and\nEXPRESSTAX(R) Franchise Corporation.\n\n\n', u'\n\n         Safe harbor statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform\nAct of 1995: Statements in this press release that are not historical fact are\nforward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties\nthat could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those\ndiscussed herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, words such\nas "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "intend," "could," "would,"\n"estimate," or "continue" or the other negative variations thereof or comparable\nterminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The risks and\nuncertainties include, without limitation, uncertainties related to estimates,\nassumptions and projections generally; inflation and other changes in economic\nconditions (including changes in interest rates and financial markets); pricing\ncompetition and other initiatives by competitors; ability to obtain regulatory\napproval for applications to underwrite in an additional jurisdiction or for\nrequested rate changes, and the timing thereof; legislative and regulatory\ndevelopments; the outcome of litigation pending against the Company and any\nsettlement thereof; risks related to the nature of the Company\'s business;\ndependence on investment income and the composition of the Company\'s investment\nportfolio; the adequacy of the Company\'s liability for loss and loss adjustment\nexpense; insurance agents; claims experience; limited experience in the\ninsurance industry; ratings by industry services; catastrophe losses; reliance\non key personnel; weather conditions (including the severity and frequency of\nstorms, hurricanes, tornadoes and hail); changes in driving patterns and loss\ntrends; acts of war and terrorist activities; court decisions and trends in\nlitigation, and health care and auto repair costs; and other matters described\nfrom time to time by the Company in releases and publications, and in periodic\nreports and other documents filed with the United States Securities and Exchange\nCommission. In addition, investors should be aware that generally accepted\naccounting principles prescribe when a company may reserve for particular risks,\nincluding litigation exposures. Accordingly, results for a given reporting\nperiod could be significantly affected if and when a reserve is established for\na major contingency. Reported results may therefore appear to be volatile in\ncertain accounting periods.\n\n                                     #####\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n-----END PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE-----\n']
