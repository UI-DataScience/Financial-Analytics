Last year\'s first quarter loss was\nunusually low due to the benefit of approximately $170 million in revenues\nrelated to the release of the record-setting best seller, HARRY POTTER AND THE\nORDER OF THE PHOENIX.\n\nNet loss for the quarter ended August 31, 2004 was $50.3 million, or $1.27 per\nshare, which included $3.6 million pre-tax, or $0.06 per diluted share, in\nseverance costs relating to the previously announced fiscal 2004 reorganization\nof the Continuities business. This compares to the year-ago net loss of $24.8\nmillion, or $0.63 per share, which included Special severance charges of $2.0\nmillion pre-tax, or $0.03 per diluted share. Revenues were $323.7 million in the\nquarter, as compared to $475.4 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\n"We are off to a good start to achieve Scholastic\'s fiscal 2005 financial\ngoals," said Richard Robinson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.\n"Strong performance in Educational Publishing, driven by technology sales, and\nimproved results in International helped us achieve a smaller than expected loss\nfor the first quarter. Our Continuities business met expectations as we\nsuccessfully executed on our plan. Non-HARRY POTTER trade revenue resumed\ngrowth, reflecting improved sales of front-list titles. Cash use was\napproximately flat with the year-ago quarter, and debt at August 31st was down\n$82 million versus last year."\n\nScholastic\'s fiscal 2005 goals include revenue of $2.1 to $2.2 billion, earnings\nper diluted share of $1.50 to $1.70, excluding severance charges, and free cash\nflow of $40 to $50 million.\n\nFIRST QUARTER SEGMENT ANALYSIS\n\nCHILDREN\'S BOOK PUBLISHING & DISTRIBUTION - Segment revenue was $121.8 million,\nas compared to $287.9 million in the year-ago quarter, and operating loss was\n$65.0 million, as compared to $16.6 million. Trade revenue declined in\ncomparison to the year-ago period, due to last year\'s release of HARRY POTTER\nAND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, partially offset by an 8% increase in other trade\nrevenues in the fiscal 2005 first quarter. As planned, Continuities results\nimproved on lower revenue as a result of reduced bad debt and fewer returns.\n\nEDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING - Segment revenue was $118.2 million, as compared to\n$105.8 million in the year-ago quarter, and operating income was $22.2 million,\nas compared to $15.5 million. A more than 50% increase in sales of the READ\n180(R) technology program fueled a 25% increase in Curriculum revenue compared\nto the year ago quarter. Library Publishing results improved, with revenue up\n18%, while sales of collections of children\'s books to schools declined\nmodestly.\n\n\n                                  Page 1 of 2\n', u'\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL - Segment revenue was $71.8 million, as compared to $65.3 million\nin the year-ago quarter, and the operating loss was $3.0 million, as compared to\n$3.9 million. Segment results reflected improved revenues and profits in the\nCompany\'s Australian operations. Revenue also benefited from $4 million in\nforeign currency translation.\n\nMEDIA, LICENSING & ADVERTISING - Segment revenue was $11.9 million, as compared\nto $16.4 million in the year-ago quarter, and operating loss was $6.7 million,\nas compared to $4.9 million. The revenue decline primarily reflects different\nproduction delivery schedules of animated television series in fiscal 2004 and\nfiscal 2005. MAYA & MIGUEL(TM), Scholastic\'s new media, licensing and publishing\nfranchise, with a focus on the adventures of a Latino family, will debut on PBS\non October 11th.\n\nCONFERENCE CALL\n\nScholastic will hold a conference call tomorrow (September 22, 2004) at 8:00\na.m. Eastern time.
