Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n- ----------  ---------------------------------------------\n\nOn September 16, 2004, the Company issued a press release announcing\nfinancial results for the fiscal third quarter ended August 31, 2004 (the "Press\nRelease"). A copy of the Press Release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and is\nincorporated by reference herein.\n\nThe Press Release contains disclosure regarding the following non-GAAP\nfinancial measures: operating income (excluding litigation settlement charges),\nnet income (excluding litigation settlement charges) and earnings per share\n(excluding litigation settlement charges), each for the Company\'s third fiscal\nquarter ended August 31, 2004, and the Company\'s operating income (excluding\nlitigation settlement charges), net income (excluding debt extinguishment and\nlitigation settlement charges) and earnings per share (excluding debt\nextinguishment and litigation settlement charges), each for the nine months\nended August 31, 2004. A reconciliation of each of these measures to the most\ncomparable GAAP measurement for the applicable period is contained in the\nCompany\'s unaudited consolidated statements of income attached to the Press\nRelease. The Company considers disclosure of the above referenced non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to be meaningful information regarding the Company\'s\nfinancial performance and useful for comparison with forecasted net income\nwithout the effect of debt extinguishment and litigation settlement charges, as\napplicable for the third fiscal quarter of 2004 and the nine months ended August\n31, 2004.\n\nThe Press Release also contains disclosure regarding the Company\'s earnings\nbefore interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure. The Press Release presents EBITDA excluding litigation\nsettlement charges for the third fiscal quarter of 2004, and EBITDA excluding\ndebt extinguishment and litigation settlement charges for the first nine months\nof fiscal 2004. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to EBITDA is\nnet income. A reconciliation of EBITDA to net income is contained in the\nCompany\'s unaudited consolidated statements of income attached to the Press\nRelease. The attachment to the Press Release also sets forth net income margin\nas the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to EBITDA margin.\n\nThe Company considers EBITDA an important indicator of its operational\nstrength and performance, including its ability to pay interest, service debt\nand fund capital expenditures. EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but\nnot as a substitute for, operating income, net income and other measures of\nfinancial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Further, EBITDA is one\nmeasure used in the calculation of certain ratios to determine the Company\'s\ncompliance with its existing credit facility.\n\nThe information in this Current Report on Form 8-K is being furnished and\nshall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by\nreference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the\nExchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in\nsuch filing.\n\n', u'\n\nItem 9.01.

Reports Third Quarter Earnings Per Share Before Litigation Charges\nIncrease 35%; Total Revenues up 12%\n\n     CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--September 16, 2004--\n\n                     Announces 2005 New Product Line-Up and\n                     Gives Initial Guidance for Fiscal 2005\n\n     Chattem, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTT), a leading marketer and manufacturer of branded\nconsumer products, announced today financial results for the fiscal third\nquarter ended August 31, 2004.\n     Total revenues for the quarter were $66.1 million, operating income\nexcluding litigation settlement charges was $16.8 million and net income\nexcluding litigation settlement charges was $9.3 million, representing increases\nof 12%, 6% and 36%, respectively, over the corresponding year-ago results.\nEarnings per share excluding litigation settlement charges for the fiscal 2004\nthird quarter were $.46, a 35% increase over the third quarter of fiscal 2003\nearnings per share.\n     Chattem's earlier estimates for its third fiscal quarter were $63-65\nmillion of total revenues and $.41-.43 earnings per share, excluding litigation\nsettlement charges. On August 27, 2004 the Company revised these estimates to\n$65-66 million of total revenues and $.44-.46 in earnings per share, excluding\nlitigation settlement charges.\n    For the first nine months of fiscal 2004, total revenues were $197.5\nmillion, operating income excluding litigation settlement charges was $51.7\nmillion and net income excluding debt extinguishment and litigation settlement\ncharges was $27.0 million, or $1.34 per share, representing increases over the\ncorresponding year-ago period of 9%, 14% and 41%, respectively.\n     After giving effect to the payments pertaining to the settlement of\nlitigation concerning Dexatrim(R) with phenylpropanolamine (PPA), the Company\nhad net income of $8.7 million, or $.43 per share, for its third fiscal quarter\nof 2004. For the first nine months of fiscal 2004, net income after debt\nextinguishment and litigation settlement charges was $15.3 million, or $.76 per\nshare. See the reconciliation of operating income excluding litigation\nsettlement charges and net income excluding debt extinguishment and litigation\nsettlement charges in Chattem's unaudited consolidated statement of income\nattached hereto.\n     The 12% increase in total revenues for the third fiscal quarter of 2004\nover the third fiscal quarter of 2003 was led by the Icy Hot(R), Aspercreme(R),\nSelsun blue(R), Gold Bond(R), Pamprin(R) and Bull Frog(R) brands.\n     Net sales of Icy Hot were once again very strong, increasing 70% over the\ncorresponding year-ago period. While the Icy Hot Patches and newly introduced\nMedicated Sleeve had outstanding quarters, the remaining portion of the\nfranchise also enjoyed double digit growth. Odor-free Aspercreme similarly\nexperienced a strong quarter with sales increasing 22%. Also enjoying\nyear-over-year sales increases during the third fiscal quarter of 2004 were\nCapzasin(R) (33%) and Sportscreme(R) (8%), further evidencing the strength of\nChattem's market-leading topical analgesic franchise.\n     Selsun blue turned in another excellent quarter with sales up 6% from the\ncorresponding year-ago period, when the brand was already enjoying outstanding\nsales. Selsun blue's domestic factory shipments have increased from\napproximately $20 million in 2001, the last full year of Abbott Laboratories'\nownership, to a projected $34 million in 2004.\n     Gold Bond's sales rose 7%, led by strong performances of the foot and\nlotion segments of the business. Shipments of the new 14-ounce pump version of\nGold Bond Ultimate Healing Lotion began in the latter half of the quarter and\nshould serve to increase the retail presence of this successful product that was\nintroduced a year ago.\n     Pamprin's sales increased 28% from the third fiscal quarter of 2003,\nprimarily due to the introduction of Pamprin All Day, which is being supported\nby an on-going media campaign.\n     Bull Frog completed its most successful summer campaign since the brand was\nacquired, with sales in the third fiscal quarter up 92% from the corresponding\nyear-ago quarter. Increased distribution and display programs and reduced\nreturns were cited as the reasons for the dramatic sales increase.\n     Somewhat offsetting the strong sales performance in the third fiscal\nquarter of 2004 was a 41% decline in the Dexatrim pill business, which continues\nto suffer from overall category sales weakness. The Dexatrim All in One Bar also\nperformed below expectations for the quarter, as the category proved to be more\npromotional and seasonal than expected. pHisoderm also experienced a quarterly\ndrop in sales, declining 17%, due primarily to intense competition in the acne\ncategory.\n     International total revenues in the quarter increased 16% from the third\nfiscal quarter of 2003, reversing three straight quarters of declining sales.\nThis increase in revenues was principally attributed to the strengthening of\nSelsun blue sales outside the United States and improvement in the Company's\nCanadian business.\n     Chattem once again enjoyed excellent margins in the third fiscal quarter.\nGross margin based on total revenues was 71.1%. Advertising and promotion as a\npercentage of total revenues was 28.2%. Selling, general and administrative\nexpense (S,G&A) as a percentage of total revenues was 17.4%.\n     For the first nine months of fiscal 2004, gross margin, advertising and\npromotion, and S,G&A as a percentage of total revenues were 71.3%, 28.5% and\n16.7%, respectively.\n     The Company's effective tax rate declined to 33% for fiscal 2004 due to the\ncontinuing implementation of tax savings initiatives. The effective tax rate for\nthe first nine months of fiscal 2003 was 37%.\n     Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)\nexcluding litigation settlement charges was $18.2 million for the third fiscal\nquarter of 2004 and $55.7 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2004,\nexcluding debt extinguishment and litigation settlement charges. The Company's\nEBITDA margin (EBITDA (excluding litigation settlement charges) divided by total\nrevenues) was 27.4% for the third fiscal quarter and 28.2% for the first nine\nmonths of fiscal 2004, when EBITDA excludes debt extinguishment and litigation\nsettlement charges. (See reconciliation of EBITDA (excluding debt extinguishment\nand litigation settlement charges) to net income in Chattem's unaudited income\nstatement attached hereto). EBITDA for the third fiscal quarter and first nine\nmonths of fiscal 2004 after debt extinguishment and litigation settlement\ncharges was $17.3 million and $51.2 million, respectively.\n     Days' sales outstanding in accounts receivable were 44 compared to 43 a\nyear ago. Inventories measured as days on hand were 92 compared to 111 a year\nago, again demonstrating Chattem's strong adherence to balance sheet discipline.\n     As was previously reported on August 27, 2004, during the third fiscal\nquarter the federal district judge presiding over the phenylpropanolamine (PPA)\nlitigation relating to the Company's Dexatrim brand stated that the Court would\nenter an order approving the settlement previously reached in this litigation.\nBased upon the Court's statements, the number of claims submitted in the\nsettlement, the number of claims which elected to opt out of the settlement and\ncontribution from insurers and other third parties, Chattem now expects to\nrecord pre-tax charges totaling $10-15 million, or $7-10 million net of taxes,\nalthough the exact timing of this charge is not yet known. The Company recorded\nthe first portion of this charge, $3.5 million pre-tax, or $.17 per share ($2.3\nmillion and $.11 per share, respectively, net of taxes), during its second\nfiscal quarter, and $834,000 pre-tax, or $.04 per share ($559,000 and $.03 per\nshare, respectively, net of taxes), during its third fiscal quarter. Chattem\nexpects to record the balance of this charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal\n2004, although the exact timing of this charge cannot yet be determined. Chattem\npreviously estimated the total pre-tax charge associated with the PPA settlement\nto be $20-25 million.\n     During its third fiscal quarter, Chattem purchased 61,100 of its shares at\nan average price of $29.14 per share. A total of $15.0 million remains available\nunder the Company's previously announced $20 million board stock repurchase\nauthorization.\n     For the fourth fiscal quarter of 2004, Chattem currently expects total\nrevenues to be in the $57-59 million range and earnings per share before\nlitigation settlement charges to be in a range of $.33-.35. For fiscal 2005,\nChattem's current expectations are that total revenues will grow 5-8% over\nfiscal 2004 levels, with earnings per share growth before any charges to be in\nthe 10-15% range. These estimates constitute forward-looking statements and are\nsubject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those set forth in\nthe Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n     Chattem also announced its line-up of product line extensions for fiscal\n2005: the Aspercreme Odor-Free Therapy Back and Body Patch which provides\nodor-free, non-irritating temporary relief from minor arthritis, joint and\nmuscle aches; Gold Bond Ultimate(TM) Comfort Body Powder, a unique time-released\nformula enriched with Aloe and vitamins A, C and E to protect and nurture all\nskin types, as well as provide body freshness, odor protection and moisture\ncontrol; Dexatrim MAX, a diet pill combining a complete daily dose of B vitamin\ncomplex and ECGC from Green Tea to boost metabolism, provide added energy, fight\nweight gain and control hunger cravings; pHisoderm pH2O, a line of three\nproducts specially formulated with an essential vitamin and hydrating complex\nthat boosts the skin's natural processes; and Bull Frog UV Defender, a line of\nthree hypoallergenic sunblocks for kids shielding delicate skin by providing\neight hours of waterproof protection from both UVA and UVB rays.\n     During the 2005 fiscal year Chattem expects to announce certain additional\nline extensions including products from Selsun blue and the topical analgesic\nportfolio.\n     Statements in this press release which are not historical facts, including,\nwithout limitation, financial guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and\nfiscal 2005, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements\ninvolve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual outcomes\nand results to differ materially from those expressed or projected.\n     Chattem will provide an online Web simulcast and rebroadcast of its third\nfiscal quarter 2004 conference call. The live broadcast of the call will be\navailable online at www.chattem.com and www.streetevents.com on Friday,\nSeptember 17 beginning at 8:30 a.m. EDT.
