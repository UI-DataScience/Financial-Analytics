Provides Supplemental Information Regarding Quarter 2005 Earnings\n\n    BEAUMONT, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 8, 2004--Conn\'s, Inc.\n(NASDAQ/NM:CONN), a specialty retailer of home appliances, consumer\nelectronics, home office products, bedding and lawn and garden\nproducts, today provided supplemental information recording its recent\nearnings release for the quarter and six months ended July 31, 2004.\n    Subsequent to the earnings conference call, several potential\ninvestors requested additional information regarding the Company\'s\nextended term promotional credit programs that helped drive same store\nsales increases of 7.2% for the quarter ended July 31, 2004 and 5.3%\nfor the six months ended July 31, 2004. In accordance with Company\npolicy and the Securities and Exchange Commission\'s Regulation FD, the\nCompany has elected to respond to such questions in a manner that will\nafford all investors an opportunity to access the same information at\nthe same time.\n    The following reflects supplemental information that the Company\nbelieves will be helpful in understanding the impact of these\npromotional programs on its operations:\n- -0-\n*T\n\n1. As the Company has previously announced, in the quarter ended April\n   30, 2004, the Company extended beyond one year its promotional\n   credit programs, which provides for a reversal of accrued interest\n   in the event that the customer timely pays their account within a\n   pre-determined time period. The Company does not accrue interest\n   on those accounts that are expected to make all payments in a\n   timely manner. In addition to the Company\'s traditional 90 day,\n   six month and one year programs, these new promotional programs\n   extend credit on a "same as cash" basis for 18 and 24 months if\n   the customer timely pays off their account through equal monthly\n   payments as originally agreed. In addition, the Company also began\n   selectively offering a 36-month "interest free" program whereby\n   interest is only assessed prospectively if the customer does not\n   honor the monthly payment terms under which the account is\n   established.\n\n2. Since these promotional programs extended payment beyond one year,\n   the Company implemented the provisions of APB 21, Interest on\n   Receivables and Payables, whereby it discounts the initial sale to\n   its present value and accretes this discount as interest income\n   over the expected life of the note.\n\n   As of, and for the quarter and six months ended July 31, 2004, the\n   following results and data are noted on these extended term\n   promotional credit programs (dollars in thousands):\n\n                                          Three Month      Six Months\n                                             Period          Period\n\nTotal product sales generated                   $8,501        $10,697\nTotal service maintenance/insurance\n premium financed (a)                            1,815          2,392\n                                         --------------  -------------\nAmount of extended term promotional\n credit                                        $10,316        $13,089\n                                         ==============  =============\n\nImpact of initial discount on recorded\n sale                                            $(716)         $(929)\nRecorded accretion of interest income in\n current period                                    143            173\n\n                                                             As of\n                                                         July 31, 2004\n\nBalance of extended term promotional\n credit portfolio                                             $13,089\n\nPercent extended term promotional credit\n portfolio to total credit portfolio                              3.4%\n\nScheduled additional accretion of\n interest income on existing extended\n promotional credit accounts through the\n end of fiscal year 2005                                         $458\n\n\n(a) A portion of the Company\'s customers purchase service maintenance\n    agreements or credit insurance at the time of the purchase of the\n    product. The premium on both policies is also eligible to be\n    financed through the extended promotional credit program. The\n    amount above represents the gross premium financed; only\n    commissions earned on the sale of these products is recorded as\n    income to the Company.\n\n    The Company has determined that approximately 57% of these\n    extended promotional credit sales represented sales to new\n    customers that had not previously financed their purchase through\n    the Company.\n\n3. Based on the stricter underwriting standards associated with these\n   new programs, the Company, generally, has attracted a higher rated\n   credit customer that the Company believes will have an even higher\n   on-time payment rate than the Company\'s average credit customer\n   and actually improve the performance of the overall credit\n   portfolio. The design of this new program is intended to offer\n   these programs only to those customers whose credit scores are\n   generally above the average credit score of our existing customer.\n\n*T\n\n    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Thomas J. Frank, commented\nas follows on the new credit programs, "We are seeing an entirely new\ncustomer as a result of these programs, one that traditionally was not\ninterested in our credit. We believe the fact that we can offer these\nnew credit programs allows us to sell additional product at a fair\nmargin, generate additional ancillary business and enhance the quality\nof our portfolio by reducing the overall delinquency and write-off\nrate. We view this program as a very positive approach to increasing\nour top and bottom line performance."\n\n    About Conn\'s, Inc.\n\n    The Company is a specialty retailer currently operating 48 retail\nlocations in Texas and Louisiana. It sells major home appliances,\nincluding refrigerators, freezers, washers, dryers and ranges, and a\nvariety of consumer electronics, including projection, plasma and LCD\ntelevisions, camcorders, VCRs, DVD players and home theater products.\nThe Company also sells home office equipment, lawn and garden products\nand bedding, and continues to introduce additional product categories\nfor the home to help increase same store sales and to respond to our\ncustomers\' product needs.\n    Unlike many of its competitors, the Company provides in-house\ncredit options for its customers. Historically, it has financed over\n56% of retail sales. Customer receivables are financed substantially\nthrough an asset-backed securitization facility, from which the\nCompany derives servicing fee income and interest income from these\nassets. The Company transfers receivables, consisting of retail\ninstallment contracts and revolving accounts extended to its\ncustomers, to a qualifying special purpose entity, or the issuer, in\nexchange for cash and subordinated securities represented by\nasset-backed and variable funding notes issued to third parties.\n\n    This press release contains forward-looking statements that\ninvolve risks and uncertainties.
