We returned to profitability this quarter with $6.9 million of\noperating income, representing 17% of revenue. Operating income also improved\nfrom second quarter 2004 by over $10 million, further demonstrating both our\nfinancial leverage and the additional cost synergies achieved since the\nLightspan acquisition. Our cash and investments grew over $9 million during the\nquarter, including over $12 million provided by operating activities. Given the\nrelatively fixed nature of most of our cost structure, our financial performance\nis expected to continue to improve as revenues grow."\n\nMr. Murray continued, "While the market has been softer than expected, we have\nsuccessfully grown revenues and deferred revenues at rates greater than the\nmarket growth rate by capturing market share. This growth reflects the superior\nquality and strength of our product offering. With a broad market leading\nportfolio of accountability, assessment and curriculum products and services, we\nare uniquely positioned to take full advantage of this growth. As our business\nmodel has demonstrated, this growth is expected to continue to generate improved\nfinancial performance and, accordingly, increased value for our shareholders."\n\nThe Company highlighted additional key financial information:\n\no    Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA),\n     calculated as operating income before depreciation, amortization and\n     restructuring charges, were $17.9 million for the twelve month period ended\n     July 31, 2004 as compared to $4.9 million for the twelve month period ended\n     July 31, 2003.\n\no    Cash and marketable securities were $31.0 million at July 31, 2004,\n     compared to $21.7 million at April 30, 2004.

These\nnon-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial\nmeasures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be\nconsidered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial\nperformance prepared in accordance with GAAP. PLATO Learning's management views\nthese non-GAAP financial measures to be helpful in assessing the Company's\nprogress in integrating the operations of Lightspan. In addition, these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to PLATO\nLearning's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors'\noperating results. PLATO Learning includes these non-GAAP financial measures in\nits earnings announcement, because the Company believes they are useful to\ninvestors in allowing for greater transparency related to supplemental\ninformation used by management in its financial and operational analysis.\nInvestors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial\nmeasures used in this press release to their most directly comparable GAAP\nfinancial measures as provided with the financial statements attached to this\npress release.\n\nQUARTERLY CONFERENCE CALL\nA conference call to discuss this announcement is scheduled for today at 3:45 PM\n(CDT).
