Total sales for the second quarter ended August 31, 2004,  increased 8.8\npercent to $2.35 billion from $2.16 billion for the second  quarter ended August\n31, 2003, with comparable store merchandise sales increasing 2.9 percent.  Total\nsales for this year\'s second  quarter  include  domestic  segment sales of $2.23\nbillion and international  segment sales of $117.8 million. The domestic segment\nsales  include  credit  revenues of $6.6  million  generated  through an ongoing\narrangement under which Chase Card Services offers  private-label and co-branded\ncredit cards to Circuit City customers in the United States.\n\nTotal sales for the six months ended August 31, 2004,  increased  7.9 percent to\n$4.41  billion from $4.09  billion in the first half of last fiscal  year,  with\ncomparable store merchandise sales increasing 4.5 percent.  Total sales for this\nyear\'s first six months  include  domestic  segment  sales of $4.27  billion and\ninternational segment sales of $139.5 million.\n\nNeither the arrangement with Chase Card Services nor the  international  segment\nwas in place for Circuit  City last  fiscal  year.  Prior to this year\'s  second\nquarter,  private-label  and co-branded credit cards were made available through\nCircuit  City\'s wholly owned  subsidiary,  First North  American  National Bank.\nPrivate-label  and co-branded  finance income generated  through that subsidiary\nwas reported as finance income on the consolidated statements of operations. The\ninternational  segment  consists of the  operations  of  InterTAN,  Inc.,  which\nCircuit City acquired in May 2004, and thus,  comparable store merchandise sales\nfor the  current  fiscal  year\'s  second  quarter and first six months and total\nsales for the same periods of last fiscal year reflect domestic sales only.\n\nNet Loss from  Continuing  Operations.  The fiscal 2005 second  quarter net loss\nfrom continuing operations totaled $11.4 million, or 6 cents per share, compared\nwith a net loss from  continuing  operations of $39.3  million,  or 19 cents per\nshare,  for the  second  quarter of fiscal  2004.  The  international  segment\'s\nresults  reduced  the  fiscal  2005  second  quarter  net loss  from  continuing\noperations by $3.4 million, or 2 cents per share.\n\nThe net loss from  continuing  operations  for the six months  ended  August 31,\n2004, totaled $16.7 million, or 8 cents per share, compared with a net loss from\ncontinuing  operations  of $67.4  million,  or 33 cents per share,  for the same\nperiod last year. The international  segment\'s results reduced the net loss from\ncontinuing  operations  for the first six months of fiscal 2005 by $3.8 million,\nor 2 cents per share.\n\nNet Sales and Operating Revenues\n"We believe year-over-year improvements in average tickets and extended warranty\npenetration  rates  for  key  merchandise   classes  are  indicative  of  better\nstore-level execution," said W. Alan McCollough,  chairman,  president and chief\nexecutive  officer of Circuit  City Stores,  Inc.  "During the first half of the\nyear, we have continued to refine our store designs,  merchandise  offerings and\nstore staffing to help ensure that we deliver an exceptional  in-store  consumer\nelectronics shopping experience during the upcoming holidays. Equally important,\nwe, just last week, launched our next-generation Web site,  circuitcity.com,  to\ntake our standard-setting online shopping experience to the next level."\n\nExtended  warranty  revenues  were as follows  for the second  quarter of fiscal\nyears 2005 and 2004:\n\nExtended Warranty Revenue(a)\n', u'\n', u'\n                                                  Three Months Ended                Six Months Ended\n                                                       August 31                         August 31\n(Dollar amounts in millions)                    2004             2003              2004           2003\n- ------------------------------------------------------------------------          --------------------\nExtended warranty revenue...................      $91.7         $77.8              $169.0        $150.2\nPercent of total sales......................        4.1%          3.6%                4.0%          3.7%\n\n(a) Calculations exclude  international segment sales and operating revenues and\ninternational segment extended warranty revenue.\n\n', u"\n\n\nThe company's  relocated  stores also continue to generate  attractive  returns.\nSince the  initiation  of Circuit  City's  store  revitalization  program at the\nbeginning  of fiscal 2001  through the end of this year's  second  quarter,  the\ncompany has  relocated  48 stores,  of which 31 have been open for more than six\nmonths.  In their first full six months  following  grand opening,  these stores\nhave averaged sales that were approximately 25 percentage points better than the\nsales pace of the  remainder  of the store base during the same time periods and\nan internal rate of return of approximately 15 percent. The company continues to\nanticipate that, as stores are added to the relocation base, the average results\nfrom relocated stores will vary.\n\nGross Profit Margin\nThe gross profit  margin was 24.6 percent in the second  quarter of fiscal 2005,\ncompared with 22.6 percent in the same period last fiscal year. The inclusion of\nthe international  segment's revenues and cost of sales,  buying and warehousing\ncontributed  77 basis points to this year's second  quarter gross profit margin.\nThe change in the gross  profit  margin of the  domestic  segment  reflects  the\nincrease in extended  warranty  sales,  which carry  higher than  average  gross\nprofit margins;  the increased  efficiency of the company's  product service and\ndistribution  operations;  and the inclusion of credit revenues in the company's\nnet sales and operating revenues.  The inclusion of credit revenues  contributed\n23 basis points to this year's second quarter gross profit margin.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were 25.0 percent of total sales in\nthe second  quarter of this fiscal  year,  compared  with 25.3  percent of total\nsales in the same period last year. The inclusion of the international segment's\nrevenues and selling,  general and administrative expenses increased this year's\nsecond  quarter   expense-to-sales   ratio  by  49  basis  points.  This  year's\nimprovement in the domestic  segment's  expense to sales ratio includes leverage\nfrom the comparable  store sales growth; a reduction in rent and occupancy costs\nas a percent of sales,  largely resulting from the closure of 19 underperforming\nstores at the end of last fiscal  year;  lower  payroll  and fringes  costs as a\npercent of sales; and lower  relocation and remodel expense,  which reflects the\nlarge number of stores that were refixtured in last year's second quarter. These\nreductions were partly offset by increases in advertising expenses.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n", u'\n', u'\n\n                                        Three Months Ended August 31             Six Months Ended August 31\n                                        2004               2003                  2004                2003\n                                              % of               % of                % of                  % of\n(Dollar amounts in millions)         $(a)     Sales       $      Sales        $(b)    Sales        $       Sales\n- -----------------------------------------------------------------------    ----------------------------------------\nStore expense....................    $520.7   22.2%    $480.7    22.3%     $  971.9   22.0%    $ 923.3     22.6%\nGeneral and administrative expenses    48.6    2.1       42.0     1.9          84.5    1.9        78.2      1.9\nRemodel expenses.................        -      -        18.2     0.8           0.1     -         29.5      0.7\nRelocation expenses..............      16.5    0.7        4.0     0.2          18.4    0.4         9.1      0.2\nPre-opening expenses.............       3.6    0.1        1.4     0.1           4.5    0.1         3.1      0.1\nInterest income..................

The company has\nsigned  leases on all the sites it expects to open this fiscal year and plans to\nopen   approximately  30  of  the  stores  in  this  year's  third  quarter  and\napproximately  16 in the fourth quarter.  Circuit City now anticipates  that its\ncapital expenditures,  net of sale-leasebacks and tenant improvement allowances,\nfor its domestic and international  segments  combined will total  approximately\n$155 million in the current  fiscal year and that  expenses  related to domestic\nstore relocations and one remodel will total approximately $47 million in fiscal\n2005.  Through the first six months,  the company has incurred 39 percent of the\nanticipated  remodel and  relocation  expenses.  Circuit  City  expects to incur\napproximately  $17  million in remodel  and  relocation  expense in the  quarter\nending November 30, 2004.\n\nStock-based Compensation Expense\nStock-based  compensation expense was $8.4 million in the second quarter of this\nfiscal year,  compared  with $12.1  million in the same period last fiscal year.\nThe  company  estimates  that  stock-based   compensation   expense  will  total\napproximately $7 million in each of the remaining quarters of the fiscal year.\n\nNet Loss from Discontinued Operations\nDiscontinued operations include the company's bankcard operation, which was sold\nto  FleetBoston  Financial in November  2003. A  transition  services  agreement\nremained in effect  through April 2, 2004.  For the second  quarter ended August\n31, 2004, the after-tax loss from the discontinued  bankcard  operation  totaled\n$507,000 and reflected post-closing adjustments related to the sale.\n\nFinancial Condition\nOn August 31, 2004,  Circuit City had cash and cash  equivalents of $954 million\ncompared with $633 million at August 31, 2003. The year-over-year  change in the\ncash  balance  reflects  the net cash  proceeds  from the sale of the  company's\nfinance operations,  partly offset by acquisition costs for InterTAN, Inc. Since\nthe end of the second  quarter of fiscal  2004,  the company  also has used $211\nmillion  to  repurchase   common  stock  under  the   company's   stock  buyback\nauthorization.\n\nA $52 million decrease in accounts receivable primarily reflects the elimination\nof $86 million in  receivables  related to the  company's  former  private-label\nfinance  operation,  partly  offset by the  addition  of $26 million of InterTAN\naccounts receivable.\n\nMerchandise  inventory  rose to $1.64  billion  at August 31,  2004,  from $1.55\nbillion at August 31, 2003.  The increase  includes  InterTAN  inventory of $106\nmillion.\n\nGoodwill and other intangible  assets of $240 million at August 31, 2004, relate\nto the company's purchases of InterTAN and MusicNow.\n\nAn  increase  of $44  million  in other  liabilities  includes  $17  million  of\nInterTAN-related other liabilities.\n\nEarnings Release and Conference Call Information\nCircuit City will host a conference  call for investors at 11:00 a.m. EDT today.\nInvestors in the United States and Canada may access the call at (800) 399-0127.\nOther  investors may access the call at (706)  634-7512.
