(NASDAQ: ASHW), a\nleading designer of sportswear and golf apparel, today announced financial\nresults for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2004.\n\nConsolidated net revenue for the third quarter ended July 31, 2004 increased\n12.8% to a record $42.8 million as compared to $38.0 million for the third\nquarter of 2003. Consolidated third quarter net income was $0.5 million or $0.04\nper diluted share compared to net income of $2.1 million or $0.16 per diluted\nshare in the same quarter of the prior year. During the third quarter of fiscal\n2004, the Company incurred a $3.0 million pre-tax charge related to a tentative\nsettlement to conclude a 1999 securities class action lawsuit against the\nCompany and certain current and former directors and officers. Excluding this\ncharge, the Company would have reported consolidated net income and earnings per\ndiluted share of $2.3 million and $0.17, respectively. The Company believes that\nexcluding the effect of the charge related to the settlement provides useful\ninformation to investors in analyzing the Company's operations in fiscal 2004 as\ncompared to fiscal 2003.\n\nThe Company attributed the record consolidated third quarter revenue to\nincreases in its domestic and international segments and a $3.4 million\ncontribution from Gekko Brands, LLC, which was acquired July 6, 2004. Third\nquarter domestic revenue increased 13.0% to $35.8 million compared to $31.7\nmillion for the third quarter of 2003. Third quarter revenue from international\nsales increased 11.9% to $7.0 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 from\n$6.3 million for the third quarter of 2003.\n\nFor the nine-month period ended July 31, 2004, consolidated net revenue\nincreased 6.6% to a record $124.8 million compared to $117.1 million for the\nsame period in fiscal 2003. Consolidated net income for the same period was $6.3\nmillion or $0.46 per diluted share compared to consolidated net income of $6.5\nmillion or $0.49 per diluted share for the same period of fiscal 2003. For the\nnine-month period ended July 31, 2004, net income was impacted by the\naforementioned pre-tax charge related to the settlement of a class action\nlawsuit and the one-time gain on sale of fixed assets recorded in the second\nquarter of fiscal 2004. Excluding these two items, the Company would have\nreported consolidated net income of $7.2 million or $0.52 per diluted share for\nthe nine-month period ended July 31, 2004. The Company believes that excluding\nthe effects of the charge related to the settlement and the gain on sale of\nfixed assets provides useful information to investors in analyzing the impact\nthe non-operational\n\n\n\n                                     Page 1\n", u'\n\ntransactions had on the Company\'s performance in fiscal 2004 as compared to\nfiscal 2003. Net revenue for the domestic segment increased 4.7% to $103.3\nmillion for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 from $98.7 million for the same\nperiod of fiscal 2003. Net revenue from the international segment increased\n16.6% to $21.5 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 from $18.5\nmillion for the same period of fiscal 2003.\n\nRandall L. Herrel, Sr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are\npleased to report solid third quarter results. The benefits of our\nmulti-channel, multi-brand distribution strategies were apparent during the\nquarter. We achieved record third quarter revenue due to growth in most channels\noffsetting soft sales in others. Revenue in our core golf, retail, and\ninternational channels increased 3.8%, 6.3% and 11.9%, respectively, offsetting\na 1.5% decline in our corporate channel. Currency exchange fluctuations\naccounted for $0.5 million of the $0.7 million total increase in net revenues\nfrom our international segment. Strong growth in sales of Callaway Golf branded\napparel and a $3.4 million contribution from the recently acquired Gekko Brands,\nLLC also contributed to our record revenue. I believe our third quarter\naccomplishments are particularly notable in light of continuing global\nuncertainties and a slow recovery in the golf industry."\n\n"We are very excited about our strategic acquisition of Gekko Brands," continued\nMr. Herrel. "The Gekko acquisition was immediately accretive and contributed\n$0.2 million or $0.01 per share to our third quarter results. This acquisition\nexpands our multi-channel, multi-brand distribution strategy as it provides us\nwith new distribution channels for the Ashworth(R) and Callaway Golf apparel\nbrands. We also expect sales growth from Gekko\'s The Game(R) brand when we\nbegin delivering this brand to our existing distribution channels."\n\nIn reviewing the Company\'s financial position, Terence Tsang, Chief Operating\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, stated, "We are pleased with the continuing\nimprovements in our operations and profitability. Third quarter gross margin\nexpanded 80 basis points to 42.1% primarily due to our continual efforts to\nimprove sourcing and reduce product costs while controlling other expenses. This\nmarks the fifth consecutive year-over-year quarterly gross margin improvement.\nThird quarter operating margin increased 80 basis points to 10.4% reflecting the\ngross margin improvement and seasonally high sales of Gekko products and the\nassociated operating leverage."\n\nMr. Tsang continued, "Our balance sheet remains strong as we continue managing\nour working capital and seek to optimize our financial leverage. As compared to\na year ago, net accounts receivable and inventory increased 25.1% and 9.7%,\nrespectively, primarily as a result of the Gekko acquisition. Total debt\nincreased to $34.5 million as of July 31, 2004 compared to $9.0 million last\nyear, $21.0 million of which was used for the Gekko acquisition and $11.6\nmillion to finance a portion of our new distribution center in Oceanside,\nCalifornia."\n\nThe Company is increasing its guidance for the fourth quarter fiscal 2004 due to\nthe acquisition of Gekko Brands, LLC. Based on current business trends, the\nCompany expects a 35% to 45% increase in fiscal 2004 fourth quarter net revenues\nto approximately $43.7 million to $46.9 million, as compared to the same quarter\nof fiscal 2003, and earnings of $0.10 to $0.14 per diluted share, compared to\n$0.07 in the same quarter of fiscal 2003. Included in the Company\'s expected\nfiscal 2004 fourth quarter earnings is a $0.02 to $0.03 per diluted share\ncontribution from the acquisition of Gekko Brands, LLC. The Company currently\nplans to report fourth quarter 2004 results on Thursday, December 16, 2004.\n\nAs a result of the increased guidance for the fourth quarter, the Company\nupdated its guidance for the full year fiscal 2004. Based on current\ninformation, the Company expects a 13% to 15% increase in consolidated net\nrevenues for fiscal 2004 to approximately $168.6 million to $171.8 million. The\nCompany expects to report fiscal 2004 earnings of $0.56 to $0.60 per diluted\nshare including the after-tax charge of $1.8 million or $0.13 per diluted share\nrelated to the settlement of a class action lawsuit and a $1.0 million or $0.07\nper diluted share after-tax gain on sale of its distribution center buildings in\nCarlsbad, California. Included in the Company\'s expected fiscal 2004 earnings is\na $0.03 to $0.04 per diluted share contribution from the acquisition of Gekko\nBrands, LLC.\n\n\n                                     Page 2\n', u'\n\nThe Company also announced its initial revenue and earnings guidance for fiscal\n2005, which includes the operations of Gekko Brands, LLC. Based on current\ninformation, the Company expects an increase in consolidated net revenues for\nfiscal 2005 to approximately $207 million to $215 million. The Company expects\nan earnings increase to approximately $0.76 to $0.82 per diluted share for\nfiscal 2005.\n\nMr. Herrel concluded, "Though we remain prudently conservative in our guidance\ndue to the uncertainty and challenges in the golf industry, we are very\noptimistic about the future of Ashworth and the opportunities provided from the\nstrategic acquisition of Gekko Brands, LLC. The acquisition enhances Ashworth,\nInc.\'s multi-brand, multi-channel, global business model in several ways. The\ntransaction increases the Company\'s channels of distribution from three to six\nand increases the number of brands that can be sold into each distribution\nchannel while leveraging existing channel relationships, sales forces and\nexpertise."\n\nInvestors and all others are invited to listen to a conference call discussing\nfiscal 2004 third quarter results and the outlook for the remainder of fiscal\n2004, today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

These adjusted non-GAAP financial measures are considered "non-GAAP"\nfinancial measures within the meaning of SEC Regulation G. The Company believes\nthat this presentation of adjusted non-GAAP results provides useful information\nto both management and investors to better understand the impact of the charge\nrelated to the settlement of the class action lawsuit booked in the third\nquarter of fiscal 2004 and the gain on sale of the Company\'s existing\ndistribution facility in Carlsbad, California booked in the second quarter of\nfiscal 2004. The presentation of this additional information should not be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles. The reconciliation set forth\nbelow is provided in accordance with Regulation G and reconciles the adjusted\nnon-GAAP financial measure with the most directly comparable GAAP-based\nfinancial measure.\n\n                                 ASHWORTH, INC.\n               ADJUSTED NON-GAAP CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n                   THIRD QUARTER ENDED JULY 31, 2004 AND 2003\n                                   (UNAUDITED)\n\n', u'\n', u'\n                                                                                                     QUARTER\n                                                           QUARTER ENDED                              ENDED\n                                                              7/31/04                                7/31/03\n                                          --------------------------------------------------       ------------\n                                                           ELIMINATION OF        ADJUSTED\n                                              AS            CLASS ACTION         NON-GAAP              AS\n                                            REPORTED       SETTLEMENT CHARGE      RESULTS            REPORTED\n                                          ------------       ------------       ------------       ------------\n', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u'\nNet Revenue ........................      $ 42,825,000       $         --       $ 42,825,000       $ 37,960,000\nCost of Sales ......................        24,798,000                 --         24,798,000         22,284,000\n                                          ------------       ------------       ------------       ------------\n   Gross Profit ....................        18,027,000                            18,027,000         15,676,000\nSelling, General and\n   Administrative Expenses .........        13,560,000                 --         13,560,000         12,051,000\n                                          ------------       ------------       ------------       ------------\nIncome from Operations .............         4,467,000                             4,467,000          3,625,000\nOther Income (Expense):\n   Interest Income .................            14,000                 --             14,000              9,000\n   Interest Expense ................
