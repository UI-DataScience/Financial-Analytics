Net income grew to\n$17.3 million, which nearly doubles the $8.7 million earned in the prior year.\nDiluted earnings per share were $.47 compared with $.26 for the third quarter\nof 2003, an increase of 81 percent.\n    Worldwide sales for the third quarter reached a record $198 million, a\n19 percent increase over sales of $166 million for the same period of 2003.\nVolume gains were 16 percent, with the remainder of the increase traced to\ncurrency effects associated with a weaker U.S. dollar.\n    Third-quarter sales volume for the company\'s advanced technology segment\ngrew 26 percent, the finishing segment increased 14 percent, and the adhesive\ndispensing segment climbed 13 percent.\n    On a geographic basis, third-quarter volume was up 9 percent in the United\nStates, 46 percent in the Americas, 13 percent in Europe, 7 percent in Japan\nand 40 percent in the Asia-Pacific region.\n    Backlog at the end of the third quarter was approximately $115 million, up\n$48 million from the beginning of the fiscal year calculated at constant\nexchange rates.\n    For the first three quarters of 2004, sales were $565 million, an\n18 percent increase over the same period of the prior year.  Sales volume\nincreased 12 percent with favorable currency effects accounting for the\nbalance.  Earnings per share on a diluted basis were $1.20, also a record,\ncompared with $.65 for the same period last year.\n    "The acceleration of business activity in our adhesive and finishing\nbusinesses, combined with the continued strength in our advanced technology\nsectors resulted in double-digit sales growth across all segments in the third\nquarter.  These factors, combined with expanding margins, produced an\nexceptional bottom-line for the period," said Edward P. Campbell, chairman and\nchief executive officer.  "We are encouraged by this trend and look forward to\nthe fourth quarter being another period of record revenue and excellent\nbottom-line results," he added.\n\n    Nordson will broadcast its third-quarter conference call on the investor\nrelations page of the company\'s Web site, www.nordson.com , on Wednesday,\nAugust 25, 2004, at 2:00 p.m. EDT.
