(National NASDAQ\nSymbol: (LAKE), a leading manufacturer of industrial protective clothing, today\nreported record earnings for its second quarter ended July 31, 2004.\n\nSix Months\n\nNet sales for the six months ended July 31, 2004 increased $2,600,000 or 5.5% to\n$49,700,000 from $47,100,000 as compared to the six months ended July 31, 2003.\n\nEarnings for the six months ended July 31, 2004 exceeded earnings for the six\nmonths ended July 31, 2003 by 38.5%. Lakeland's net income for the six months\nended July 31, 2004 increased to $2.6 million from $1.9 million for the six\nmonths ended July 31, 2003. As for net income per basic and diluted share,\nLakeland reported $0.72 for the six months ended July 31, 2004 - up 26.3% from\n$0.57 for the six months of 2003.\n\nThe Company's earnings have continued their upward trend for four consecutive\nyears.\n\nThree Months\n\nNet sales for the second quarter ended July 31, 2004 decreased 1.9% to\n$22,800,000 compared with the 2003 second quarter net sales of $23,300,000. This\nwas due to a difficult comparison against last year's second quarter which\nincluded approximately $1,500,000 in SARS induced buying. We believe that many\nof our customers increased their inventories of Tyvek products during our second\nquarter ended July 31, 2003 in response to the outbreak of SARS in Toronto,\nCanada and the anticipation that it would break out in the U.S.A.\n\n\n", u'\n\n\nWhen it became apparent by August of 2003 that SARS would not break out in the\nUS our customers used the inventory they had built up to meet their needs, into\nour third quarter ended October 31, 2003.\n\n\nWe further believe this to be the case as August 2004 monthly sales exceeded\nAugust 2003 monthly sales by almost 16%. This provides evidence of a return to\nmore historical buying trends, rather than the spikes and valleys caused by the\n2003 SARS epidemic.\n\nAdditionally, this quarter we commenced moving some of the production of our\nwoven and fire products made at our Missouri facility to the Company\'s Chinese\nsubsidiaries. This caused us to turn away approximately $400,000 in sales while\nwe began moving these specific product lines overseas. Although these product\nmoves may impact the sales and earnings of this smaller wovens division in the\ncoming quarters, it should increase the Company\'s earnings significantly once\ncompleted in early 2005.\n\nLakeland\'s net income for the second quarter ended July 31, 2004 increased to\n$1.14 million from $.99 million compared to the second quarter of 2003 - up\n15.4%. As for net income per basic and diluted share, Lakeland reported $0.30\nfor this second quarter and for the second quarter ended July 31, 2003. Weighted\naverage shares outstanding increased 594,310 in the second quarter of 2004\nreflecting the impact of the Company\'s June 18, 2004 offering of 1,100,000 new\nshares and its July 1, 2004 additional offering of 180,750 new green shoe shares\nto the public.\n\nAt July 31, 2004, the Company\'s balance sheet included total assets of $58.7\nmillion, cash and marketable securities of $10.6 working capital of $48.7\nmillion, no short-term bank debt and stockholders\' equity of $52.0 million or\n$11.41 per share of book value.\n\nLakeland continues to make progress in the transfer of its USA made glove, fire,\nand woven products to its other wholly-owned subsidiaries in Mexico and China.\nWe believe that such relocation of our manufacturing will continue to positively\nincrease our margins.\n\nHomeland Security Sales of our high end chemical suits continued their rapid\nsales growth of 60% in the second quarter 2004 versus the comparable prior year\nquarter. We are beginning to see and procure larger orders of our high-end\nchemical suits as evidenced by a $900,000 order that was received in the second\nquarter 2004. This is the largest one time order we have received in the\nHomeland Security area. We expect that once federal guidelines have been\npromulgated for our Homeland Security products in 2005, we will begin to see\nmore of these million dollar plus orders from the states.\n\nWe also are continuing our search for compatible acquisitions.\n\n\nStatements contained in this press release that are not historical facts are\nforward-looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions\nof the Private Securities and Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
