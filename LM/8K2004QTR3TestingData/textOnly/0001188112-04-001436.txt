The Order provides that The MIIX Group\nand New Jersey State Medical Underwriters, Inc. will continue to provide\nadministrative services to MIIX Insurance pursuant to the current Management\nServices Agreement until terminated by the Department after appropriate notice.\nThe Order does not stay payment of claims for any litigation currently pending\nagainst MIIX Insurance or its insureds and does not bar claimants from filing\nnew actions against MIIX Insurance insureds. The Order, however, prohibits\npersons from filing any new action or new claim directly against MIIX Insurance\nwithout the permission of the Court.\n\nIn addition, all directors and officers of MIIX Insurance and of its two\nsubsidiaries, Lawrenceville Holdings, Inc. and MIIX Insurance Company of New\nYork, resigned from their positions, effective September 28, 2004.\n\nForward-Looking Statement\n\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on the\nCompany\'s expectations concerning future events and are subject to certain risks\nand uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from\nthose reflected in the forward-looking statements. In particular, the Court\'s\naction in placing an insurance subsidiary into rehabilitation will adversely\naffect the Company\'s ability to manage its runoff and to restructure its\noperations or sell its assets and to continue as a going concern. These and\nother uncertainties and other factors are detailed from time to time in the\nCompany\'s filings with the appropriate securities commissions.\n\n\nContact:\nAllen Sugerman\nChief Financial Officer\n(800) 234-MIIX, ext. 1311\nasugerma@miix.com\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n-----END PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE-----\n']
