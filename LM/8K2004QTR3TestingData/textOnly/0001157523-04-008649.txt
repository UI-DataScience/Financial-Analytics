Announces Record Revenues for the Twelve Month Period Ended\nJune 30, 2004\n\n    BRANCHBURG, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 20, 2004--Hydromer, Inc.\n(HYDI.OB - OTC BB; HDO - BSX) reports that the Company achieved record\nrevenue levels for the year ended June 30, 2004. Revenues of\n$8,690,323 were $2,317,120 higher than the previous fiscal year of\n$6,373,203, or an increase of 36.4%. Net Income was $231,336 ($0.05\nper share) for the current year as compared to $133,826 ($0.03 per\nshare) the year before, a 72.9% increase. For the three months ended\nJune 30, 2004, the Company is reporting a Net Loss of $66,439 ($0.01\nper share) on revenues of $2,680,821 after a $252,000 impairment of\ngoodwill charge taken in the quarter. This compares with Net Income of\n$37,249 ($0.01 per share) on revenues of $1,759,881 the comparative\nquarter a year ago.\n    For the year ended June 30, 2004, products and services sales were\n$6,167,822, up 48.2% from $4,162,737 the prior year. Royalties,\noptions and licensing revenues were up 14.1% to $2,522,501 from\n$2,210,466 the year before. The Company\'s gross profit (Revenues less\nCost of Sales) for the year ended June 30, 2004 of $5,630,391 was up\n36.5% from $4,124,104 the previous year. Operating expenses were\n$4,720,864 this year as compared with $3,976,101 last year (up 24.4%).\nPre-tax income for the year ended June 30, 2004 was $548,855 up\n$345,767 (170.3%) from $203,088 the year before.\n    "In fiscal 2004, we continue our revenue growth for the ninth\nconsecutive year, setting a new Company revenue record (this includes\nthe effects from the acquisition of Biosearch Medical Products Inc\n("BMPI") in February 2000). Since 1995, our compounded annual rate of\nrevenue growth was 25.0%! Such growth was made possible by the\nstrategies and initiatives undertaken by the Company which began years\nago, and continued in the years throughout. This includes the\nacquisition of BMPI and the shift from straight technology licensing\ntowards contract product development, contract manufacturing and\ncoating services. It is primarily in these areas which contributed to\nthis past year\'s revenue growth." said Robert Y. Lee, Vice President\nof Finance.\n    "Earnings before Income Taxes of $548,855 for the twelve months\nended June 30, 2004 was also impressive" added Robert Y. Lee. "Our\nresults would have been greater had we not had the $252,000 charge for\nthe impairment of goodwill, which is a non-cash charge. The goodwill\nin question was created from the acquisition of BMPI in 2000 in which\nwe recorded $511,000 in goodwill. After a change in accounting rules,\nwhich no longer allowed us to amortize the goodwill balance over 40\nyears but to review for impairment periodically, and after a few years\nof realizing the cost savings from synergies of integrating Hydromer,\nInc and BMPI, along with the additional revenues realized (and still\nforthcoming to be realized) which was made possible only through the\nacquisition of BMPI, the carrying value of goodwill as of June 30,\n2004 was no longer at the level pre-accounting rule change. The\nresulting write-off of $252,000 affected both pre-tax and after-tax\nincome to the same extent as there was no net tax benefit to this\ncharge. This impairment charge now, however, allows us to continue on\nwith our operations without this impairment affecting future results."\n    "We look to continue our success. During the fiscal 2004 year, we\nadded two chemists, two engineers and two QA specialists. Since June\n30, 2004, we have added an additional three scientists. This group is\nin the forefront of allowing us to develop new technologies and\nproducts or to support our product quality. Our primary cost is in\npeople costs. We strive to attract the best in personnel as it is the\npeople within our organization who create our success. We have found a\nbusiness formula that has worked for us and we will continuously\nimprove it for future success."\n\n    CONTACT: Hydromer, Inc.\n             Robert Y.
