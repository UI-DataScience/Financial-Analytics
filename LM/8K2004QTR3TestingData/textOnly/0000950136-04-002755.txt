(AMEX: MSI), today\nannounced financial results for the three months and full year ended June 30,\n2004. As expected, the Company experienced significantly lower net sales and\nprofitability in the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter, compared with the same period\nlast year. Despite this decline, the balance sheet improved at June 30, 2004\ncompared with the prior year\'s statement and the Company made considerable\nprogress towards expanding future business.\n\nNet sales for the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter decreased 32.2 percent to\n$10,524,000 from $15,513,000 for the 2003 final quarter. For the full year, net\nsales declined to $53,691,000 from $64,916,000 in the prior year.\n\nFor the 2004 fourth quarter, a net loss of $506,000, or $0.03 per share, was\nrecorded compared with last year\'s net income of $1,049,000, or $0.07 per\ndiluted share. The quarterly gross margin decreased 6.5 percent to 25.8 percent\nfrom 32.3 percent in the 2003 comparable period while selling, general and\nadministrative expenses in the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter increased to\n$3,557,000 from last year\'s $3,311,000.\n\nMel Knigin, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated: "We view the bottom\nline results as a temporary setback that the Company\'s financial strength easily\nwithstood. We were pleased to continue to generate positive cash flow in fiscal\n2004. At June 30, 2004, Movie Star had no debt and $2,527,000 in cash.\nShareholders\' equity increased slightly in 2004 to $17,747,000 from $17,264,000\nat June 30, 2003. Furthermore, the manner in which we have continued to closely\nmanage our balance sheet enabled us to acquire the inventory and other assets of\nSidney Bernstein & Son Lingerie, Inc. and enter into a new credit facility with\nHSBC Bank USA."\n\nFor fiscal 2004, net income decreased to $128,000, or $0.01 per diluted share,\nfrom $3,431,000, or $0.22 per diluted share, reported last year. For fiscal\n2004, the gross margin decreased a modest 1.7 percent to 30.0 percent from last\nyear\'s 31.7 percent. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to\n$15,824,000 from last year\'s $14,623,000. The current year included a special\ncharge of $1,084,000 taken in the third quarter. Had it not been for this\ncharge, selling, general and administrative expenses would have almost equaled\nthe prior year\'s figure.\n\nMr. Knigin further said, "Management has worked hard in following strategies\nthat will expand the Company\'s top line growth beginning this fiscal year even\nthough we are experiencing certain gross margin pressures. Despite this lower\ngross margin, there is a special sense of optimism throughout Movie Star looking\nat our next six-month selling cycle based on the additional open orders of the\nSidney Bernstein and Son division. We believe that our top line will begin to\ngrow starting in the second quarter of this fiscal year. The Sidney Bernstein\nand Son division is off to an excellent start. Additionally, the initial\nresponse to our new Maidenform line that is scheduled for delivery in the\nbeginning of calendar 2005 has been strong."\n\n', u"\n\nMOVIE STAR, INC. produces and sells ladies apparel, including sleepwear, robes,\nleisurewear, and daywear. Current collections include the Cinema Etoile premium\nline of intimate apparel and the Movie Star line of apparel sold as private\nlabel programs.\n\nCertain of the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking and\ninvolve a number of risks and uncertainties. Among the factors that could cause\nactual results to differ materially are the following: business conditions and\ngrowth in the industry; general economic conditions; addition or loss of\nsignificant customers; the loss of key personnel; product development;\ncompetition; risks of doing business abroad; foreign government regulations;\nfluctuations in foreign rates; rising costs for raw materials and the\nunavailability of sources of supply; the timing of orders booked; and the risk\nfactors listed from time to time in the Company's SEC reports.\n\n\nCONTACT:
