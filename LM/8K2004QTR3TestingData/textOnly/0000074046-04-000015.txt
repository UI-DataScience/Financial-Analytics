The company\nreported a net loss of $237,000 or $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter\ncompared to net income of $476,000 or $0.08 per diluted share in the same\nquarter one year ago.\n\nSales for fiscal year 2004 were $185,511,000, a 7% increase from sales of\n$173,041,000 for fiscal year 2003. Net income for the fiscal year was $5,033,000\nor $0.84 per diluted share, a 63% increase in net income over net income of\n$3,083,000 or $0.54 per diluted share for fiscal year 2003.\n\nThe fourth quarter pre-tax loss of $153,000 includes settlement costs of\n$1,250,000 and defense costs of approximately $700,000 associated with the\nCompany\'s settlement of previously disclosed patent infringement litigation.\nExcluding these items, the company earned pre-tax income of $1,797,000 during\nthe quarter. In the same quarter one year ago, the company reported pre-tax\nincome of $511,000 that included a write-off of $573,000 associated with the\nChristmas Valley, Ore., plant closing. Excluding this item, the company earned\npre-tax income of $1,084,000 in the same quarter one year ago.\n\nFiscal year 2004 pre-tax income of $6,931,000 includes a $464,000 loss on\nimpaired assets related to a write-off of box line packaging equipment, and a\n$200,000 reserve for obsolete packaging inventory in conjunction with the sale\nof the dog treats business and the patent infringement litigation defense and\nsettlement costs mentioned above. Excluding these items, the company earned\npre-tax income of $9,545,000 in fiscal year 2004.\n\nFiscal year 2003 pre-tax income of $4,342,000 included gains from sales of real\nestate and mineral rights totaling $449,000, and a payment of $675,000 from a\ncustomer who failed to meet minimum purchase requirements under a supply\nagreement. It also included a $385,000 asset write-off, a $350,000 goodwill\nwrite-down associated with an equity investment and the Christmas Valley plant\nasset write-off of $573,000. Excluding all of these items, the company earned\npre-tax income of $4,526,000 for fiscal 2003.\n\nFISCAL 2004 IN REVIEW\n\nDaniel S. Jaffee, President and CEO commented, "This year we benefited from our\nfocused efforts to reduce costs while growing our business. Over the past\nseveral years we have communicated our need to strengthen the company\'s national\npresence, increase sales and profitability and expand our new product\ndevelopment effort.\n\n"We have completed one full year of national manufacturing and distribution\npresence through the acquisition of the Jonny Cat(R) brand and our mining and\nproduction facilities in Taft, Calif. We have also been able to increase\nprofitability through targeted marketing efforts in all major markets.\nAdditionally, our attention to new product development is making headway as we\ngo into fiscal 2005.\n\n"Despite severe volatility in the cost of oil and natural gas, margins have\nincreased year over year as a result of manufacturing process improvements and\nour ability to increase prices to cover the rising cost of energy.\n\n"While we are generally pleased with sales and earnings for the year, we faced\nsome challenges in the fourth quarter. Among these were the heavy marketing and\nintroduction costs for the Jonny Cat Scoop products and slower demand for\nagricultural carriers.\n\n"Most significantly, in the fourth quarter we announced a settlement and\ndismissal of a patent infringement lawsuit. Under the terms of the settlement,\nthe plaintiff has granted Oil-Dri paid-up licenses of the two patents involved\nin the litigation as well as for a third patent owned by the plaintiff. We were\nsatisfied with the terms of the settlement and are pleased that these costs will\nnot impact future earnings."\n\n\n', u'\n\n\n\nYEAR-END BUSINESS REVIEW\n\nSales in the CONSUMER PRODUCTS GROUP were flat for the quarter and up 9% for the\nyear. While both grocery and non-grocery outlets were strong for the year with\nthe addition of Jonny Cat scoopable products, some of the growth on the West\nCoast was hampered by grocery strikes that began late last year and continued\ninto early 2004. Though the grocery business is still recovering, Jonny Cat\nproducts are gaining expansion into non-grocery markets where they had been\nunderrepresented.\n\nStrong sales and profit contribution from the Canadian operation were up both\nfor the quarter and year. This helped to offset reduced sales from the company\'s\nco-packaging business and the second quarter sale of its dog treats business.\n\nCROP PRODUCTION AND HORTICULTURAL PRODUCTS GROUP sales were down 31% in the\nquarter and 4% for the year. While Agsorb(R) agricultural carriers enjoyed\nstrong sales early in the fiscal year, shipments leveled off in the second half,\nas anticipated. Sports turf sales were also down slightly overall for fiscal\n2004.\n\nThe INDUSTRIAL AND AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTS GROUP sales were up 4% for the quarter\nand 8% for the year. Strong synthetic sorbent sales continue to drive growth in\nboth industrial and automotive markets. Distributor relationships have\nsuccessfully contributed to this year\'s sales and profitability growth, as well\nas our expanded West Coast and nation-wide sales efforts.\n\n\nSales were up 21% in the quarter for the SPECIALTY PRODUCTS GROUP and 11% for\nthe fiscal year. All specialty products have outpaced last year\'s performance.\nParticularly strong for the Specialty Products Group has been sales of its\nanimal health and nutrition product lines, including ConditionAde(R) 200 HPC\nmycotoxin binder and Poultry Guard(R) litter amendment. Expansion of these\nproducts into new markets and efforts to revitalize existing business has paid\noff, especially internationally. The bleaching clay business was also strong in\nthe fourth quarter.\n\n\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\n\nOn June 8, 2004, Oil-Dri\'s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash\ndividend of $0.10 per share on Common Stock. The dividend was paid on September\n10, 2004 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 6, 2004.\nAt the July 31, 2004 closing price of $16.39 and assuming cash dividends\ncontinue at the same rate, the annual yield on the company\'s Common Stock is\n2.4%.\n\nDuring the fiscal year, the company repurchased 119,506 shares of stock, at an\naverage price of $15.27 per share. The company has 182,504 shares remaining\nunder its current repurchase authorization. Cash, cash equivalents and\nshort-term investments at July 31, 2004, totaled $23,069,000. Operating cash\nflow was $18,285,000 for the fiscal year. Capital expenditures for the fiscal\nyear totaled $6,067,000, which was $1,990,000 less than the depreciation and\namortization of $8,057,000. Debt repayments for the year totaled $4,000,000.\n\nThe company\'s effective tax rate was 27.4% of pre-tax income for the fiscal year\nversus 29.0% for fiscal 2003. The decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal\n2004 was due mostly to a change in estimate in calculating the company\'s\ndepletion deduction. It is expected that the company will benefit from lower\nrates throughout fiscal 2005.\n\nLOOKING FORWARD\n\nJaffee commented, "We are moving in the right direction with our business\nstrategy and goals. We have increased cash, cash equivalents, and short-term\ninvestments by $6,399,000, and paid off $4,000,000 in debt this fiscal year.\n\n"We have invested in our consumer brands of Cat\'s Pride and Jonny Cat litters\nthis year and look forward to positive feedback from our consumer market in\nfiscal 2005. Our Specialty Products Group has made great strides in expanding\ntheir scope into international markets. The prospects for further development\nare hopeful in the coming fiscal year. Our focus remains on new product\ndevelopment.\n\n"In light of all the developments that are coming from both existing business\nand new products, fiscal year 2005 looks promising. We are therefore estimating\nearnings per share for fiscal 2005 in the range of $1.20 - $1.30. We feel this\nstrikes a good blend between delivering increased profitability to our\nstockholders and allowing us to invest significant resources behind\nopportunities that will, we hope, bear fruit in upcoming years.\n\n\n\n', u"\n\n\n\n\n                                        ###\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\n           THE COMPANY WILL OFFER A LIVE WEB CAST OF THE FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS\n           TELECONFERENCE ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 2004 AT 10:00AM CST.
