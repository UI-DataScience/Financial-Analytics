For the quarter-ended July 31, 2004, the Company reports\nrevenues of $29.6 million, net income of $199,000 and diluted earnings per\nshare of $0.01.\n\n                                      ($ in millions, except per share data)\n                                          2Q             1Q             2Q\n                                       FY 2004        FY 2004         FY 2003\n\n    Total revenue                       $29.6           $29.8         $36.2\n    Operating income (loss)              $0.6           $(1.2)         $4.3\n    Net income (loss)                    $0.2           $(0.8)         $3.9\n    Earnings (loss) per share, basic    $0.01          $(0.03)        $0.17\n    Earnings (loss) per share,\n     diluted                            $0.01          $(0.03)        $0.17\n\n    Comparison of Q2 2004 vs. Q1 2004\n\n    Second quarter 2004 revenue was $29.6 million as compared to the first\nquarter 2004 revenue of $29.8 million.  While revenue in total was essentially\nflat, the Company did experience an increase in both software implementation\nand consulting revenue.  Both the Revenue Enhancement ("RevE") consulting\nbusiness segment and the Global Payments Consulting ("GPC") business segment\nexperienced revenue increases from the prior quarter.  Offsetting the\naforementioned increases were declines in both software license and\nmaintenance revenue, primarily within the Global Payments Technology ("GPT")\nbusiness segment.  However, the addition of a number of significant new\ncontracts in GPT in Q2 resulted in the strongest quarterly sales to date of\nsoftware and services in that segment, with the resulting revenue being\nrecognized during the balance of 2004 and 2005.  The decline in license fees\nin Q2 2004 from the prior quarter is primarily due to a large sale of a\nlicense for our Check Image Archive product, which generated $2.9 million of\nrevenue during Q1. Maintenance revenue declined in Q2 versus Q1 primarily due\nto the timing of cash receipts on maintenance contracts.  The Company\'s first\nfiscal quarter typically reflects increased maintenance revenue in association\nwith payments on calendar year maintenance contract renewals. Gross margin in\nQ2 2004 was 51% versus 52% in the prior quarter.\n\n    Second quarter 2004 operating income of $631,000 compares favorably to the\n$1.2 million operating loss during the first quarter 2004 primarily because of\na $1.7 million litigation-related charge recorded in Q1. The second quarter\nincluded two notable items that impacted the quarter:  a $1.2 million benefit\nassociated with a change in estimate related to a reserve for a discontinued\nproduct and $1.2 million of litigation costs associated with now settled\nlitigation.\n\n    Comparison of Q2 2004 vs. Q2 2003\n\n    The second quarter 2004 revenue of $29.6 million declined approximately\n18% from the second quarter 2003.  The decrease primarily occurred in software\nlicense, maintenance, and implementation fees.  Soft sales in Q4 2003 and Q1\n2004 and the timing of maintenance collections contributed to the decline in\nrevenue.  Additionally, Q2 2003 revenue was unusually high as the Company was\nable to recognize maintenance revenue that previously had not been recognized\nin Q4 2002 and Q1 2003 as some banks delayed cash payments for their\nmaintenance renewals pending the completion of the Company\'s restatement.\nConsulting revenue increased in Q2 2004 and served to partially offset the\ndecline in total revenue.  Second quarter 2004\'s gross margin of 51% was below\nthe 55% in Q2 2003 due to lower revenue in Q2 2004.\n\n    Second quarter 2004 operating income of $631,000 was significantly below\nthe $4.3 million operating income in the second quarter 2003 mainly due to the\nhigher Q2 2003 revenues as noted above.  This decline in operating income was\npartially offset by a decrease in operating expenses.  Operating expenses were\n$1.1 million lower in Q2 2004 than Q2 2003 primarily as a result of lower\npersonnel costs, a reduction in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\napproximating $200,000 and lower restructuring charges.  Second quarter 2004\noperating expenses included both the previously mentioned $1.2 million of\nlitigation costs associated with now settled litigation and the $1.2 million\nbenefit resulting from the change in estimated reserves related to a\ndiscontinued product.\n\n    Guidance\n\n    As you may recall, in the fourth quarter 2003 and the first quarter 2004\nearnings conference calls we indicated that the timing of bank decisions,\nrelative to Check 21, was generally 1 to 2 quarters later than our initial\nassumption.  While it does appear that the decision process is picking up as\nreflected in our record sales contracts in GPT in Q2, the revenue impact will\nnot be visible until later 2004 or early 2005 due to our revenue recognition\npolicies surrounding the significant number of new products to become\nGenerally Available or GA in Q3, Q4 of 2004 and Q1 2005.\n\n    We continue to feel confident regarding the market and demand for products\nand services in our space.  Consistent with our prior guidance, we believe\nthat we are still on track for attractive revenue growth in late 2004 or early\n2005.  While we expect continued strength in contracted sales in Q3 and\nbeyond, we expect revenues for Q3 to remain relatively flat and operating\nprofits to be approximately break-even or slightly negative due to the effect\nof soft sales in Q4 2003 and Q1 2004, delays in implementation schedules by\nour Check 21 clients, increases in non-capitalized R&D expense associated with\nnew product opportunities, and expansion of our Global Payments Consulting\nbusiness segment.  Q4\'s outlook will be very sensitive to the volume and\ntiming of sales, product delivery, and client implementation schedules.\n\n    "Although our second quarter profitability was not at desired levels, the\nrecord sales contracts achieved in our GPT business during the quarter is an\nindication that we are gaining momentum," said J.D. (Denny) Carreker, Chairman\nand Chief Executive Officer of Carreker Corporation. "We are positioning\nourselves to take full advantage of the present and continuing opportunities\nafforded by recent regulatory changes as well as revenue growth pressures\nchallenging our clients and expect to realize associated revenue growth from\nthese changes in late 2004 or 2005."\n\n    Conference Call\n\n    Management has scheduled a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday,\nSeptember 1, 2004, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
