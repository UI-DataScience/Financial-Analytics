The increase in net earnings\nfor the quarter compared to the same quarter one year earlier is attributable to\nseveral factors.  Net interest income improved by $138,000 from $962,000 for the\nquarter ended June 30, 2003 to  $1,101,000  for the quarter ended June 30, 2004.\nThe  Company's  net interest  margin,  which is net interest  income  divided by\naverage  interest-earning  assets, was 4.72% for the quarter ended June 30, 2004\ncompared to 4.36% for the same period ended 2003. For the quarter ended June 30,\n2004 there was an  increase  in  non-interest  expense  of $66,000 to  $692,000,\ncompared to $626,000 for the quarter  ended June 30, 2003,  primarily the result\nof  increases  of  $22,000  in  office   property  and  equipment,   $14,000  in\nadvertising,   and  $108,000  in  compensation   and  benefits.   The  increased\ncompensation  expense is mainly a result of hiring and training  our  additional\nstaff for our new Pleasant Hill, Iowa,  office that will open in August of 2004,\nbut is enhanced  by  increased  employee  insurance  costs and a $35,500  credit\nadjustment of pension  expense posted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Some\nnon-interest  expense  increases were offset by a substantial  decrease in other\nexpense of $68,000 primarily comprised of reduced employee education costs, loss\non disposal of fixed assets,  and a reduction in audit and accounting expense in\nthe quarter ended June 30, 2004. An overall  increase in non-interest  income of\n$23,000,  comprised  primarily of an increase in fees,  commissions  and service\ncharges of $32,000,  contributed  to the increase in earnings for quarters being\ncompared.  Provisions for losses on loans  increased by $30,000 from $60,000 for\nthe quarter ended June 30, 2003 to $90,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2004.\n\nThe Company also reported  results for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.  The\nCompany  reported net earnings of $1,331,000 or $1.72 per share,  fully diluted,\nfor the  twelve  months  ended  June  30,  2004,  compared  to net  earnings  of\n$1,139,000 or $1.48 per share,  fully diluted,  for the twelve months ended June\n30,  2003,  an increase of 16.8%.  The increase in income for the fiscal year is\nprimarily  attributable  to increased  net  interest  income of $397,000 for the\nfiscal year ended 2004 as compared to 2003 and increased  non-interest income of\n$340,000,  as a result of a  $162,000  securities  impairment  loss on an equity\nsecurity  in the 2003  fiscal  year and a $155,000  increase in gains on sale of\nsecurities  in 2004.  Fees,  commissions  and  service  charges  also  increased\n$62,000.  Provision for loan losses  increased  $64,000 to $300,000 for the year\nended June 30,  2004  compared  to  $236,000  for the year ended June 30,  2003.\nNon-interest  expense increased  $433,000 during the fiscal year to $2.9 million\nfrom $2.4 million  mainly due to increased  compensation  expense of $261,000 as\n\n\n", u'\n\n\nthe Company has added  employees  to open our new bank office in Pleasant  Hill,\nIowa. Office property and equipment  expense  increased  $113,000 for the fiscal\nyear ended 2004 over the prior year primarily attributable to increased property\ntaxes, depreciation, technology equipment maintenance, and office building rent.\nNet interest  margin for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 was 4.61%  compared\nto 4.31% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003. "I am very pleased that income\nfor the fiscal year remained very strong and sufficient to produce an annualized\n12.15% return on equity," stated Robert W. DeCook, Chief Executive Officer.\n\nAt June 30, 2004,  Horizon  Financial  Services  Corporation had total assets of\n$99.0 million and stockholders\'  equity of $11.5 million, or $14.86 per share of\ncommon stock  outstanding  compared to assets of $91.3 million and stockholders\'\nequity of $10.4 million or $13.95 per share at June 30, 2003.  Horizon Financial\nServices Corporation and its subsidiary, Horizon Federal Savings Bank, provide a\nwide range of  financial  products  and services  through  three  offices in two\ncounties in southeast Iowa. In addition, the Company will open a new bank office\nin Pleasant Hill, Iowa, a suburb of Des Moines, near the end of August, 2004.\n\nThe annual  meeting  record date is September 3, 2004 and the annual  meeting of\nshareholders  will be held  October  28,  2004,  at the home  office of  Horizon\nFederal Savings Bank, 301 1st Avenue East, Oskaloosa, Iowa, at 3:00p.m.\n\nHorizon Financial Services  Corporation also announced that the Corporation will\npay a cash  dividend  of 6.25  cents  per share  for the  first  quarter  ending\nSeptember  30,  2004.
