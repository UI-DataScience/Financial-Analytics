(NYSE:VOL) today reported financial results for the\nCompany\'s third quarter and nine months ended August 1, 2004.\n    Volt will conduct a conference call webcast at 11:00 A.M. (EDT)\ntoday to discuss third quarter results. The conference call dial-in\nnumber is 1-800-857-0373 (domestic) or 1-773-756-4602 (international),\npasscode: Third Quarter. The conference call will be broadcast live\nover the Internet and can be accessed for the next 30 days at\nhttp://www.volt.com/investor/press_release.cfm.\n    The following is a summary of the Company\'s results of operations\nand the notes thereto. The notes are an integral part of the summary.\n\n    THIRD QUARTER - FISCAL 2004 RESULTS\n\n    For the third quarter ended August 1, 2004, the Company reported\nnet income of $9.2 million, or $0.60 per share, on net sales of $500.7\nmillion, compared to net income of $2.1 million, or $0.14 per share,\nfor the comparable quarter of the previous year, on net sales of\n$415.2 million.\n\n    NINE MONTHS - FISCAL 2004 RESULTS\n\n    For the first nine months of fiscal 2004, the Company reported a\nnet income of $21.5 million, or $1.40 per share, on net sales of $1.4\nbillion, compared to a net loss of $2.1 million, or $0.14 per share,\non net sales of $1.2 billion last year, for the comparable nine months\nof the previous year.\n    The Company reported income from continuing operations of $12.0\nmillion, or $0.78 per share, in the nine months ended August 1, 2004\ncompared to a loss from continuing operations of $2.1 million, or\n$0.14 per share in the comparable fiscal 2003 period. The results of\nthe first nine months of fiscal 2004 included income from discontinued\noperations, net of taxes, of $9.5 million, or $0.62 per share, from\nthe sale of real estate previously leased to the Company\'s formerly\n59% owned subsidiary, Autologic Information International, Inc. The\nCompany\'s interest in the subsidiary was sold in November 2001.\n    "This has been an exciting quarter for Volt," commented William\nShaw, President and Chairman of the Company. "The extremely strong\nperformance, both in increased sales and operating profit, as well as\nthe acquisition of Nortel\'s directory and operator services business\nfor our Computer Systems segment, is a continuation of the material\nimprovement and momentum of the Company\'s operations during the entire\nyear," stated Mr. Shaw. "Three of our four segments contributed to the\ntwenty-one percent increase in sales and the two hundred and\nforty-seven percent increase in operating profit compared with the\n2003 third quarter." "I am particularly pleased", continued Mr. Shaw,\n"that our operating profit growth rate throughout the year has\nsignificantly exceeded the growth in sales."\n\n    STAFFING SERVICES\n\n    Both the Technical Placement division and the Administrative and\nIndustrial division of this segment contributed to the 20% increase in\nsales and 131% increase in the segment\'s operating profit on a\ncomparable quarter basis. The Administrative and Industrial division\nreturned to profitability, with a six-hundred thousand dollar\noperating profit compared to a two million dollar loss in the\ncomparable fiscal 2003 quarter. This improvement resulted from both a\n31% increase in sales and a 0.9 percentage point increase in gross\nmargin. Gains were shown both in temporary and permanent placement\nbusiness of the division. The increase in gross margin occurred even\nthough payroll taxes have increased, as previously noted.\n    The Technical Placement division\'s increase from the prior year\'s\nthird quarter in operating profit of 56% also resulted from both an\nincrease in sales, both in traditional placement and in the project\nmanagement and consulting business, and an increase in gross margins\nof 23%. Sales for this division increased by 15% compared to the 2003\nthird quarter.\n\n    COMPUTER SYSTEMS\n\n    Improvements in this segment\'s operator service business, a growth\nin DataServ\'s directory service business with non-telco companies, an\nincrease in sales in the Maintech division and an increase in product\nrevenue of 22% resulted in a 154% increase in operating profit from\nthe 2003 comparable quarter. In addition, there was an increase in\ngross margins of 10.7 percentage points and a 4.4 percentage points\ndecrease in overhead as a percentage of sales. Of the $5.5 million\nincrease in operating profit, $1.2 million resulted from the\nsettlement of a vendor dispute and vendor refunds related to prior\nperiods.\n    As previously noted in a press release of August 2, Volt Delta\nResources LLC, the principal business unit of this segment, acquired\ncertain assets and liabilities of the directory and operator services\nbusiness of Nortel Networks on August 2. This acquisition will permit\nVolt Delta to provide the newly combined customer base with new\nsolutions, and an expanded suite of products, content and enhanced\nservices.\n\n    TELEPHONE DIRECTORY\n\n    Operating profit for this segment decreased by $1.5 million\ncompared to the 2003 comparable quarter, primarily the result of a\n$1.5 million sales decline in the segment\'s Telephone Directory\nProduction division, due to a previously reported loss of a major\ncontract, and a $1.6 million decline in revenue from the segment\'s\nUruguayan operations. The operating loss of these two divisions was\npartially offset by a $1.4 million increase in the operating profit of\nDataNational, the publisher of community directories.\n\n    TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES\n\n    A strong performance by the Business Systems and Construction and\nEngineering divisions of this segment more than offset continued\nlosses in the Central Office division and returned the segment to\nprofitability for the quarter. Sales increased 50% and overhead was\nreduced to 20% of sales. This produced an operating profit of $1.0\nmillion for the quarter. However, the depressed condition of the\ntelecommunications industry continues to reduce available work and\nputs extreme pressure on gross margins, which declined in the quarter\ncompared to last year.\n\n    GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSES\n\n    General corporate expenses increased by $0.7 million compared with\nthe third quarter of 2003, primarily the result of increased spending\nfor professional fees and corporate systems.\n\n    LIQUIDITY\n\n    Cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, decreased to\n$34.3 million at August 1, 2004 from $43.2 million at November 2,\n2003. At August 1, 2004, the Company had sold a continuing\nparticipating interest in accounts receivable of $60.0 million under\nits securitization program, an increase of $10.0 million from the end\nof the second quarter, and had the ability to finance up to an\nadditional $90.0 million under the facility.\n    The Company may also borrow under its $30.0 million revolving\nsecured credit facility, which is limited by a specific borrowing\nbase. At the end of the third quarter, $26.6 million was available\nunder the borrowing base. The Company had borrowed 2.0 million British\npounds ($3.6 million) at August 1, 2004 under the $30.0 million\nrevolving secured credit facility.\n\n    Volt Information Sciences, Inc. is a leading national provider of\nStaffing Services and Telecommunications and Information Solutions for\nits Fortune 100 customer base.

                 ========================================\n\n                            (Notes Follow)\n\nNote A - The results of discontinued operations reflect the sale\n         of real estate, in the second quarter of 2004, previously\n         leased by the Company to its former 59% owned subsidiary,\n         Autologic Information International, Inc., which interest\n         was sold in November 2001. The cash transaction resulted in a\n         $9.5 million gain, net of taxes of $4.6 million.\n\n     B - Under certain contracts with customers, the Company manages\n         the customers\' alternative staffing requirements, including\n         transactions between the customer and other staffing vendors\n         ("associate vendors"). When payments to associate vendors are\n         subject to the receipt of the customers\' payment to the\n         Company, the arrangements are considered non-recourse against\n         the Company and revenue, other than management fees to the\n         Company, is excluded from sales. Cash restricted to cover\n         such obligations is included in cash and cash equivalents on\n         the August 1, 2004 and November 2, 2003 balance sheets.\n\n     C - Under an accounts receivable securitization program, the\n         Company, through a 100%-owned consolidated special purpose\n         subsidiary, sold a participation interest of $60.0 million\n         out of pool approximating $229.5 million of receivables to an\n         unaffiliated third party. The outstanding balance of the\n         participation interest sold at November 2, 2003 was $70.0\n         million. Accordingly, the trade receivables included on the\n         August 1, 2004 and November 2, 2003 balance sheets have been\n         reduced to reflect the $60.0 million and $70.0 million\n         participation interest sold, respectively.\n\n\n    CONTACT: Volt Information Sciences, Inc.\n             James J.
