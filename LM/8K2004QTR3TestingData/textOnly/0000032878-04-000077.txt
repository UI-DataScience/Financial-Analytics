The Company reported a loss of $51.4 million on revenues of\n$66.3 million, compared to a loss of $36.2 million on revenues of $65.2 million\nin fiscal year 2003.  On a per-share basis, the loss was $2.15 in 2004 compared\nto a loss of $1.65 in 2003.\n\n     The increased operating loss in 2004 versus 2003 was primarily due to lower\nrevenues from product development activities and equipment contracts with Rare\nEarth Ovonic, and higher costs for patent defense, the inclusion of a full year\nof operating results for United Solar Ovonic and a decrease in revenues from\nlicense agreements, partially offset by higher royalties.\n\n      The table below summarizes the Company's operating results (in thousands):\n\n                                                  Year Ended June 30,\n                                        ---------------------------------------\n                                                 2004             2003\n                                             ------------     ------------\n                                        (in thousands, except per-share amounts)\n  Revenues\n      Product sales                           $  33,857        $  22,416\n      Royalties                                   2,522            1,844\n      Revenues from product development\n        agreements                               29,221           37,335\n      Revenues from license agreements              125            3,444\n      Other                                         580              140\n                                              ---------        ---------\n  Total Revenues                                 66,305           65,179\n\n  Expenses                                      117,071           98,456\n\n  Net Loss from Operations                      (50,766)         (33,277)\n\n  Other Income (Expense)\n      Interest income                               714            3,561\n      Equity in losses and write-down of\n        joint ventures                             (644)         (11,795)\n      Other                                        (726)           3,097\n                                              ---------        ---------\n                                                   (656)          (5,137)\n                                              ---------        ---------\n  Net Loss Before Cumulative Effect of\n    Change in Accounting Principle            $ (51,422)       $ (38,414)\n  Cumulative Effect of Change in\n    Accounting Principle                           -               2,216\n                                              ---------        ---------\n  Net Loss                                    $ (51,422)       $ (36,198)\n                                              =========        =========\n  Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share\n    Before Cumulative Effect of Change in\n    Accounting Principle                      $   (2.15)       $   (1.75)\n  Basic and Diluted Net Income Per Share\n    for Cumulative Effect of Change in\n    Accounting Principle                           -                 .10\n                                              ---------        ---------\n  Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share        $   (2.15)       $   (1.65)\n                                              =========        =========\n\n                                          - more -\n", u'\n\n\n                                             2\n\n     "Our goal is to move the Company into sustained profitability by July 2006.\nThis will be accomplished by transitioning from a highly successful R&D Company\nto accelerating the commercialization of the products and technologies we have\ndeveloped in the fields of energy and information," Robert C. Stempel, Chairman\nand CEO, said. "The plan is to grow the solar, battery and OUM businesses; move\nour hydrogen and other technologies into the commercial stage; achieve cost\nreductions across the enterprise; and capitalize the business for the\ntransition. At the same time, we will continue our valuable materials research\nand technology development to enhance our product portfolio in future years."\n\n     Product sales increased principally due to increased sales by United Solar\nOvonic LLC, as well as the effect of consolidating United Solar Ovonic\'s\noperations after the May 14, 2003 acquisition. United Solar Ovonic\'s thin-film\ntriple-junction solar products continue to receive worldwide acceptance. Our\nbookings indicate a continuing trend of revenue growth with recent orders such\nas the 300kW photovoltaic system for the Beijing New Capital Museum, an order\nfor 2.4MW from Solar Integrated Technologies and an additional order of 750kW\nfrom Alwitra of Germany increasing sales to Alwitra in 2004 to 1.5MW.\n\n     Revenues from product development agreements decreased as a result of lower\nrevenues received related to battery R&D as Cobasys, our battery manufacturing\njoint venture, moves into production, together with decreases in our funded\nprograms in fuel cell and hydrogen technologies, partially offset by United\nSolar Ovonic\'s revenues from its contract with the U.S. Air Force Research\nLaboratory.\n\n     In May 2004 United Solar Ovonic was awarded a $4.02 million, 18-month\ncontract to develop new solar cell technology to be used in space and airship\nvehicles addressing defense and homeland security applications. This contract\nbuilds upon the success of an $11.5 million contract awarded in May 2003 by the\nAir Force.\n\n     In July 2004, ECD and Cobasys LLC entered into a settlement agreement with\nMatsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. (MEI), Panasonic EV Energy Co., Ltd.\n(PEVE), and Toyota Motor Corporation with respect to patent infringement\ndisputes and counterclaims involving Ovonic nickel metal hydride (NiMH)\nbatteries before the International Chamber of Commerce, International Court of\nArbitration. Under the terms of the settlement, no party admitted any liability.\nAlso, Cobasys and PEVE will cross license each other for current and future\npatents to avoid possible future litigation. Cobasys and PEVE have agreed to a\ntechnical cooperation agreement to advance the state-of-the-art of NiMH\nbatteries which are widely used in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Cobasys and\nPEVE have also established a joint development program to collaborate on the\ndevelopment of next-generation high performance NiMH batteries for HEVs.\n\n     The year-end results exclude the funds received under the battery\nsettlement with MEI, PEVE and Toyota, which will be recorded in the first\nquarter of fiscal year 2005.\n\n     In August 2004, Cobasys announced its complete line of advanced Ovonic\nNiMH-based NiMHax(R) battery packs for all transportation applications ranging\nfrom 144 volts and 30kW for light-duty automotive applications to 672 volts and\n280kW for large commercial applications (trucks and buses). Cobasys is poised to\ntake advantage of the emerging hybrid electric vehicle market with its new\n170,000 square foot state-of-the-art battery production facility with new\nautomated manufacturing equipment in Springboro, Ohio. The new facility is ISO\nand QS certified and is capable of producing 1.2 million battery modules\nannually at full capacity when fully equipped.\n\n\n', u"\n\n\n                                       3\n\n     Ovonyx continues to make good progress in the commercialization of its OUM\ntechnology. In August 2004, Ovonyx announced the signing of a license agreement\nwith Nanochip, Inc. granting it the right to use the Ovonyx memory technology in\nits Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS)-based, ultra-high density data\nstorage systems.\n\n     Additional information about the Company and its audited financial results\ncan be found in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended June 30, 2004 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and will\nbe available on the Company's website on or about September 15, 2004.\n\n     ECD will hold a conference call on Tuesday, September 14, 2004 at 1:00 p.m.\n(Eastern Time) to discuss its fiscal year 2004 results.
