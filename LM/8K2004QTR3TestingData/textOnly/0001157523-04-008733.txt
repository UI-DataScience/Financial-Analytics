A copy of the Earnings  Press  Release is attached as Exhibit  99.1.  The\nEarnings Press Release is incorporated herein by Reference.\n\n(a.) Golden  Enterprises,  Inc.\'s Board of Directors  today declared a quarterly\n     dividend of $.03125 per share payable  October 27, 2004 to  stockholders of\n     record on October 8, 2004.\n\n     For the three  months ended August 31,  2004,  Golden  Enterprises,  Inc.\'s\n     basic and diluted  earnings per share were $.02  compared to $.04 last year\n     (restated), on net sales of $24,766,426 versus $24,580,778, 1% increase.\n\n     During the first  quarter,  gross margins  increased  $.15 million,  or 1%,\n     compared to the prior year quarter,  as gains from  improved  manufacturing\n     efficiencies  more than offset net  unfavorable  raw material and packaging\n     costs.\n\n     Selling,  general and administrative expenses increased $.59 million, or 5%\n     during the first quarter ended August 31, 2004. This increase was primarily\n     in selling and delivery expenses and employee benefit costs.\n\n     Management will continue to explore ways to manage our rising fuel cost and\n     other increasing commodities.\n\n     The  following is a summary of sales and income  information  for the three\n     months ended August 31, 2004 and 2003.\n\n\n                                                THREE MONTHS ENDED\n                                                    AUGUST 31,\n                                            -------------------------\n                                                           (Restated)\n                                                2004          2003\n                                            -------------------------\nNet sales                                   $24,766,426   $24,580,778\n                                            ===========   ===========\n\nIncome before income taxes                  $   298,525   $   685,337\nIncome taxes                                    110,350       253,645\n                                            -----------   -----------\n\nNet income                                  $   188,175   $   431,692\n                                            ===========   ===========\n\nBasic and diluted earnings per share        $      0.02   $      0.04\n                                            ===========   ===========\n\nBasic weighted shares outstanding            11,852,830    11,883,305\n                                            ===========   ===========\n\nDiluted weighted shares outstanding          11,852,830    11,883,305\n                                            ===========   ===========\n\n\n\n     This News Release contains certain  forward-looking  statements  within the\n     meaning of the Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995.
