(Nasdaq: PTMK)\ntoday reported results for its second quarter and six-month period ended July\n31, 2004.\n\nSales for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 were $1,011.7 million, an increase\nof 1.6% from $995.6 million in the prior year\'s second quarter. Same-store sales\nincreased 1.3% in the second quarter. The net loss was $1.6 million, or $0.05\nper diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to net earnings\nof $6.2 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, in the prior year\'s second quarter.\nThe results for the second quarter of fiscal 2003 included a $12.1 million\npre-tax gain, or $0.24 per diluted share, from the disposition of real estate\nand a $3.0 million pre-tax charge, or $0.06 per diluted share, related to labor\nbuyout and headcount reduction programs. Excluding these items, net earnings in\nthe second quarter of fiscal 2003 would have been $0.8 million, or $0.03 per\ndiluted share.\n\nEileen Scott, Chief Executive Officer said, "We had mixed results for our second\nquarter in what continues to be a difficult economic environment in the markets\nwe serve and in the face of increasingly aggressive promotional programs by our\ncompetitors. While same-store sales rose 1.3% as a result of increased\npromotional spending, our earnings were negatively affected by the incremental\ncosts associated with these promotions, as well as continued gross profit\npressures from inflation in certain categories. We also experienced higher\nmedical expenses, a trend that is affecting our entire industry. We saw a\nweakening in consumer demand and in our operating performance in the second half\nof the quarter, a trend that has continued into our current quarter. Looking\nforward, we remain highly focused on driving our sales through effective\nmarketing programs, controlling costs and modernizing our stores through our\nrenovation program. These strategies should position us to benefit when market\nconditions improve."\n\nSales for the first six months of fiscal 2004 were $2,001.8 million, an increase\nof 0.1% from $2,000.3 million in the prior year\'s six-month period. Same-store\nsales decreased 0.1% in the six-month period. The net loss was $3.4 million, or\n$0.11 per diluted share, in the first six months of fiscal 2004 compared to net\nearnings of $7.1 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, in the prior year\'s\nsix-month period. The results for the first six months of fiscal 2004 included a\n$1.2 million pre-tax gain, or $0.02 per diluted share, from the disposition of\nexcess real estate. Excluding the aforementioned real estate gain, the Company\nwould have reported a net loss of $4.1 million, or $0.13 per diluted share. The\nresults for the first six months of fiscal 2003 included a $13.7 million pre-tax\ngain, or $0.27 per diluted share, from the disposition of real estate and an\n$8.1 million pre-tax charge, or $0.16 per diluted share, related to labor buyout\nand headcount reduction programs. Excluding these items, net earnings in the\nfirst six months of fiscal 2003 would have been $3.8 million, or $0.13 per\ndiluted share.\n\nFIFO EBITDA, which the Company defines as earnings before interest, taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization and the LIFO charge was $35.8 million and $70.8\nmillion, respectively, in the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal\n2004 compared to $49.8 million and $89.8 million, respectively, in the prior\nyear\'s second quarter and six-month period. Excluding the above-referenced $12.1\nmillion real estate gain and $3.0\n\n                                      -4-\n', u'\n\n\nmillion charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2003, FIFO EBITDA would have been\n$40.7 million. Excluding the above-referenced $1.2 million real estate gain in\nthe first six months of fiscal 2004, FIFO EBITDA would have been $69.6 million.\nExcluding the above-referenced $13.7 million real estate gain and $8.1 million\ncharge in the first six months of fiscal 2003, FIFO EBITDA would have been $84.2\nmillion.\n\nThe Company is presenting FIFO EBITDA and each of FIFO EBITDA and net earnings\n(loss) excluding the identified items above in order to allow investors to\ncompare more fully Pathmark\'s performance in the second quarter and the first\nsix months of fiscal 2004 with its performance in the second quarter and the\nfirst six months of fiscal 2003. None of these measures is calculated in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles. See the notes to the\ntables attached to this release for more information regarding FIFO EBITDA.\n\nTotal capital investments in the first six months of fiscal 2004 were $64.5\nmillion, including cash capital expenditures of $44.9 million, $4.5 million for\nthe acquisition of the remaining 67% of a supermarket joint venture in Newark,\nNew Jersey ("Newark Store") and capital leases of $15.1 million. During the\nfirst six months of fiscal 2004, we opened two stores (including the Newark\nStore), renovated ten stores, and closed two stores, one of which was operated\nby a joint venture in Brooklyn, New York. During the remainder of fiscal 2004,\nwe expect to complete ten store renovations. Capital expenditures for fiscal\n2004, including property acquired under capital leases, the acquisition of the\nNewark Store and technology investments, are expected to be approximately $105\nmillion.\n\nMs. Scott said, "Given our results to date and our expectation of a more\ncompetitive environment during the remainder of the year, we have revised our\nannual guidance. Same-store sales are expected to be flat to up 1.0%, net\nearnings per diluted share of $0.00 to $0.20 and FIFO EBITDA of $154 million to\n$165 million. Previously, our guidance was same-store sales flat to up 1.0%, net\nearnings per diluted share of $0.28 to $0.47 and FIFO EBITDA of $170 million to\n$180 million (see Table C for additional information).\n\nAdditionally, the Company noted that it is in the process of refinancing its\ncredit agreement and that one of the lenders in its existing bank group has\nagreed to use its best efforts to arrange for commitments for a new $250 million\ncredit facility, which would completely refinance its existing credit agreement.\nThe Company also noted that, based on its revised EBITDA guidance, it is\nprobable that at the end of the third quarter it would not be in compliance with\ncertain covenants in its existing credit agreement for the four fiscal quarters\nending October 30, 2004, which would constitute an event of default thereunder.\nThe Company anticipates closing on the new credit facility in the next 30 days.\n\nPathmark will conduct a conference call at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)\ntoday. The call may be accessed via a simultaneous webcast by visiting\nwww.calleci.com. A replay of the call will be available for 14 days after the\ncompletion of the call at 1-877-519-4471, Pass Code 5100210.

quarter of fiscal\n        2004 and $2.1 million in the first six months of fiscal 2004 reflect a\n        provision for certain state taxes and a change in the effective annual\n        income tax rate recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. As a\n        result, the effective tax rates for the second quarter and first six\n        months of fiscal 2004 were approximately 30% and 38%, respectively. The\n        income tax provisions of $4.2 million and $4.8 million, respectively, in\n        the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2003 were based on an\n        effective income tax rate of 40.3% for the full fiscal year. The fiscal\n        2003 income tax provisions were net of the WOTC, which expired on\n        December 31, 2003. Legislation is pending to reinstate the WOTC,\n        retroactive to the beginning of 2004.\n\nb)      FIFO EBITDA represents earnings (loss) before interest, taxes,\n        depreciation and amortization and the LIFO charge. We believe that our\n        investors find FIFO EBITDA to be a useful analytical tool for measuring\n        our performance and for comparing our performance with the performance\n        of other companies having different capital structures. In addition,\n        FIFO EBITDA is consistent with the targets utilized in our incentive\n        compensation program. FIFO EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should not\n        be considered in isolation from, and is not intended to represent an\n        alternative measure of, operating earnings or of cash flows from\n        operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Our\n        measurement of FIFO EBITDA, as presented below (in millions), may not be\n        comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies:\n\n', u'\n', u'\n                                                                   13 Weeks Ended                26 Weeks Ended\n                                                             ----------------------------  ----------------------------\n                                                               July 31,       August 2,      July 31,        August 2,\n                                                                 2004           2003           2004            2003\n                                                             ------------   -------------  -------------  -------------\n\n', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u'\n      Net earnings (loss)..................................  $      (1.6)   $       6.2    $      (3.4)   $       7.1\n\n      Adjustments to calculate FIFO EBITDA:\n\n         Interest expense..................................         16.3           17.5           32.8           34.4\n\n         Income tax benefit (provision)....................
