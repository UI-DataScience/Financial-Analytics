(NYSE: RAI) today\nissued earnings guidance for 2004. This is the first full-year earnings\nguidance issued by Reynolds American since becoming a publicly traded company\non July\xa030, 2004, following a combination of the nation\x92s No.\xa02 and No.\xa03\ncigarette manufacturers, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and the U.S. business of\nBrown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation (B&W). Also on that date, Reynolds\nAmerican acquired Lane Limited from British American Tobacco, p.l.c.

These\ncost-savings initiatives, as well as incremental earnings from the new\nbusinesses partially offset by merger-related costs, are contributing to\nforecasted 2004 operating income of $1\xa0billion to $1.05\xa0billion, net income of\n$645\xa0million to $675\xa0million, and diluted earnings per share of $5.75 to\n$6.05.\x94\n\n\n\n', u'-more-\n\n\n\n', u'\xa0\n', u' PAGEBREAK ', u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'-2-\n\n\n', u'Neal specifically detailed several key elements included in today\x92s 2004\nguidance, noting that operating income includes:\n\n\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\x95', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'$500\xa0million to $550\xa0million of cost-savings associated with the\nrestructuring plan announced in the fall of 2003.

She also said that, as required by the company\x92s\nagreement with BAT, Reynolds American will repurchase shares to offset stock\noptions that are exercised through June\xa02005.
