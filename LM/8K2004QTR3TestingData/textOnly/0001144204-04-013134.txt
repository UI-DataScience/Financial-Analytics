REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2004 RESULTS\n\n                        REVENUES JUMP 81% YEAR OVER YEAR\n\nSAN RAMON, CA -- AUGUST 25, 2004 -- SBE, Inc. (Nasdaq:SBEI),  a leading provider\nof high performance OEM network connectivity  solutions,  today reported results\nfor the three-month and nine-month periods ended July 31, 2004.\n\nNet sales for the third  quarter of 2004 were $2.9  million,  compared with $1.6\nmillion  for the third  quarter  ended July 31,  2003.  Net income for the third\nquarter of 2004 was  $79,000,  or $0.02 and $0.01 per share,  basic and diluted,\ncompared to net income for the third  quarter of 2003 of $141,000,  or $0.03 per\nshare, basic and diluted.\n\nNet sales for the nine months  ended July 31, 2004 were $8.8  million,  compared\nwith $5.2  million for the same period last year.  Net income was  $660,000,  or\n$0.13 and $0.11 per share, basic and diluted,  respectively, for the nine months\nended July 31, 2004  compared to a net income of  $284,000,  or $0.04 per share,\nbasic and diluted, for the first nine months of fiscal 2003.\n\nGross margin for the third quarter of 2004 was 53%, compared to 66% for the same\nquarter in 2003.  Gross  margin for the nine months ended July 31, 2004 was 54%,\ncompared to 62% reported for the same period of 2003.  The decrease in the gross\nmargin is due primarily to the reduction in the gross margin attributable to the\nsale of products to a large  customer  combined with  approximately  $102,000 of\nnon-cash  quarterly  amortization  of the  intellectual  property  acquired from\nAntares in the fourth  quarter of fiscal  2003.  Our gross  margin on sales to a\nlarge  customer  for the quarter  was lower in the same  quarter in 2003 due, in\npart, to sales in 2003 of  previously  written down  inventory.  The Company has\nalso seen some erosion in gross  margin due to slightly  higher raw material and\nmanufacturing  costs. To help counteract  component delivery lead-time and price\nincrease issues,  we have decided to purchase certain critical  components ahead\nof our customer's  orders.  Although we continue to have limited visibility into\nour customer's  product demand, our critical inventory purchase plan is based on\nour best estimate of current customer demand and their past ordering patterns.\n\nTotal operating  expenses increased in the third quarter of 2004 to $1.5 million\ncompared to $1.0 million in the same  quarter of 2003,  primarily as a result of\nincreases in the  staffing  levels of our  engineering  group  combined  with an\nincrease  in  marketing  investments.  SBE  continues  to  pursue  a  policy  of\naggressive  investment in new product  research and  development  and have added\nengineering resources to execute the programs. During the past year SBE returned\nto product  advertising and industry trade show participation to promote our new\nproduct  rollout and take advantage of the economic  recovery.  Total  operating\nexpenses for the nine months  ended July 31, 2004 were $4.1 million  compared to\n$3.0 million in the same period one year ago.\n\n\n", u'\n\n\n"Our third  quarter  revenues  grew 81% year over year and we achieved our goals\nfor sales backlog for the quarter just ended. Although we have not seen a robust\nrecovery of the overall networking and communications markets, we do continue to\nsee strength from our legacy  products  along with customer  product  deployment\nactivity in select areas such as WiFi, E911, voice conferencing,  and VoIP media\ngateways,"  said  William B. Heye,  Jr.,  president  and CEO,  SBE. "We achieved\nimportant  milestones with our new product  initiatives during the quarter. I am\npleased  to report  that we  installed  our Dual Port  Gigabit  Ethernet  TCP/IP\nOffload  Engine  ("TOE")  product in select BETA customer sites and test results\nindicate  that  the TOE  performance  exceeds  expectations.  The  TOE has  been\ninstalled  in  conjunction  with PyX  Technologies\'  iSCSI  software for storage\nnetworking   applications  as  well  as  independently  in  high-traffic  server\napplications.  This BETA testing will continue as we approach  production status\nin the coming quarter. We continue to make key investments in R&D and during the\nquarter  released  several new products such as the addition of packet  switched\nbackplane  capability  to our HighWire  line, a new 24 channel T1 card set and a\n672 channel T3 adapter card.  These new products are attractive to our customers\nfor their  application-ready  telecommunications  platforms,  and enable  timely\nintegration and product  deployment.  Overall, I am pleased with the progress we\nhave made in implementing our strategic plan," said Heye.\n\nThe company  continues to generate  adequate cash flow and liquidity to fund its\nbusiness plan. SBE closed the quarter with a sales backlog of $3.9 million, $1.5\nmillion in cash and $5.3 million in working capital (current assets less current\nliabilities).\n\nBUSINESS OUTLOOK\n\nThe following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are\nforward-looking,  and actual results may differ  materially.  See the cautionary\nstatement at the end of this press release for a summary of the risks associated\nwith  forward-looking  statements and where to find more  information  regarding\nsuch risks.\n\n"Based on our current view of business,  sales forecasts,  and existing backlog,\nwe expect  revenue  growth and  profitability  will  continue  in the  remaining\nquarter of fiscal 2004.  We  anticipate  net sales for fiscal 2004 to be between\n$12.0 million and $14.0 million and diluted earnings per share for the year will\nbe between $0.12 and $0.14.  We remain  committed to our strategy of maintaining\nprofitability in the near term while  positioning the organization for long-term\ngrowth with R&D investments in high growth markets," said Heye.\n\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\n\nSBE\'s third quarter  conference  call will be held Thursday,  August 26 at 11:00\na.m.  Eastern Time / 8:00 a.m.  Pacific  Time.
