This revised forecast for earnings does not include an\nanticipated $0.11 per share of property-related gains for the full year.\n\n         Commenting on the Company\'s revised forecast, Monroe J. Carell,\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We expect earnings to be lower\nthan previously anticipated due to lower revenues and higher-than-forecasted\noperating costs in the fourth quarter. Revenues were impacted by the recent\npolitical conventions in New York and Boston, hurricanes and storms throughout\nthe Southern and Eastern corridors and an overall softness in the economy.\n\n         "While we are disappointed in our revised earnings outlook, we are\npleased that we have been able to continually generate free cash flow to reduce\ndebt throughout the year. We expect to reduce debt by more than $80 million\nduring fiscal 2004," Carell concluded.\n\n         The Company expects to release fiscal 2004 earnings after the market\nclose on Wednesday, November 3 with a conference call on Thursday, November 4.\n\n         Central Parking Corporation, headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, is\na leading provider of parking and transportation-related services. The Company\noperates approximately 3,600 parking facilities containing more than 1.6 million\nspaces at locations in 38 states, the District of Columbia, Canada, Puerto Rico,\nthe United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Chile, Colombia, Germany, Mexico,\nPeru, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, Venezuela and Greece.\n\n         This press release contains historical and forward-looking information.\nThe words "expect," "continue to expect," "remain optimistic," "should,"\n"believe," "anticipate," "project," "plan," "estimate," "objective," "outlook,"\n"assumptions," "guidance," "forecast," "revised forecast," "revised\nexpectations," "goal," "intend," "will likely result," or "will continue" and\nsimilar expressions identify forward-looking statements.
