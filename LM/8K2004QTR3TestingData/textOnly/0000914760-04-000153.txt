LOUIS, MO., August 26, 2004 - Kellwood Company reported operating results\nfor the second quarter ended July 31, 2004, according to Hal J. Upbin, chairman\nand chief executive officer.\n\n         Sales for the second quarter increased $51 million, or 10 percent to\n$560 million, versus $509 million last year due to a combination of organic\ngrowth of $34 million, or 7 percent, and the acquisition of Phat Fashions and\nPhat Farm which provided $17 million of revenue. Phat Fashions and Phat Farm\nwere acquired on February 3, 2004, and are being reported within the Men's\nSportswear segment.\n\n         The organic growth was driven by the new marketing initiatives put in\nplace during the last nine months of fiscal year 2003 including Calvin Klein(R),\nIZOD(R), XOXO(R) and Lucy PeredaTM women's sportswear, Liz Claiborne(R) Dresses\nand Suits, and Def Jam UniversityTM urban sportswear which collectively provided\n$43 million of growth in the second quarter. This growth was partially offset by\nthe planned elimination of certain low margin programs, which reduced sales by\n$15 million. Sales growth of the remaining businesses in the second quarter was\n$6 million, or 1 percent.\n\n         The year-to-year organic sales growth for the quarter came from the\nWomen's Sportswear segment, up 10 percent, and the Men's Sportswear segment, up\n13 percent. These increases were partially offset by an 8 percent drop in sales\nof Other Soft Goods.\n\n         Net earnings in the second quarter from continuing operations were\nstrong, increasing $2.3 million, or 30 percent, to $10.2 million, or $0.36 per\ndiluted share, versus $7.9 million, or $0.29 per share last year. The increase\nin earnings was driven by increased sales, a 1.5 percentage point increase in\ngross profit as a percent of sales partially offset by higher SG&A spending\nattendant with the new marketing initiatives and SG&A expense from the\nacquisition of Phat Fashions and Phat Farm. This is the ninth consecutive\nquarter in which Kellwood has reported a significant year-to-year improvement in\ngross profit as a percent of sales reflecting the continued underlying strength\nof operations, improved sourcing, quality of inventory and improving mix of\nbusiness.\n\n         Kellwood ended the quarter with an exceptionally strong balance sheet\nwith ample liquidity to fund acquisitions to enhance its diversification and\ncapability to service the needs of the Company's customers.\n\n                                     -MORE-\n\n\n\n", u'\n\n                                     [LOGO]\n\n                                    KELLWOOD\n\n\n\nADD ONE\n\n         Total inventory at the end of the second quarter including inventory\nfrom the acquisition increased by only $4 million versus prior year and\nrepresented 57 days supply, versus 62 days at the end of the second quarter last\nyear.\n\n         Sales for the first six months grew by $66 million, or 6 percent to\n$1.247 billion, versus $1.181 billion last year. The increase came from organic\ngrowth of $39 million, or 3 percent and $27 from the acquisition of Phat\nFashions and Phat Farm made earlier this year. The increase in organic sales for\nthe first half came from an 8 percent increase in Women\'s Sportswear and a 7\npercent increase in Men\'s Sportswear, partially offset by a 13 percent drop in\nsales of Other Soft Goods.\n\n         Net earnings from continuing operations for the first six months\nincreased $6.3 million, or 22 percent, to $35.3 million, or $1.26 per share on a\ndiluted basis, versus $29.0 million, or $1.08 per share last year. The strong\ngrowth in net earnings for the first half was driven by higher sales and by a\n1.9 percentage point year-to-year improvement in gross profit. Kellwood\'s\ninvestment in launching several new brands and the acquisition of Phat Fashions\nand Phat Farm has resulted in higher SG&A spending. These initiatives are\nexpected to generate an accelerating rate of growth in sales and operating\nearnings during the second half of the year.\n\n         "As Kellwood looks ahead to the third quarter and total year, we remain\noptimistic that the economy, the rate of job creation, and consumer confidence\nand spending on apparel will continue to improve albeit at a slower pace than\nexperienced earlier this year. We see this same sense of guarded optimism\nexpressed by our customers as they book orders for Fall and Holiday. Like our\ncustomers, Kellwood would rather focus on gross margin and inventory turnover\nthan get too far ahead of a cautious consumer with orders and inventory.\n\n         "As a result of the recent softening in consumer demand for apparel, as\nindicated by Fall orders from customers and some delays in launching certain new\nmarketing initiatives from the third to the fourth quarter, we expect sales in\nthe third quarter to increase by 12 to 13 percent and be in the range of\n$720-$730 million versus $644 million last year, "said Upbin.\n\n         Net earnings from continuing operations are forecasted to increase by\napproximately 5 percent and be in the range of $32.5 million, or $1.15 per\ndiluted share, versus $30.9 million, or $1.13 per share reported last year.\n\n         The Company expects to be on target with its financial plan for the\nfiscal year which calls for sales to increase by 11 percent to approximately\n$2.6 billion, versus $2.35 billion last year. Net earnings from continuing\noperations for the year are planned to increase by $16-$18 million, or\napproximately 24 percent to $89-$91 million, or $3.15-$3.25 per diluted share,\nversus $72.6 million, or $2.68 per share reported last year.\n\n                                     -MORE-\n\n', u'\n\n                                     [LOGO]\n\n                                    KELLWOOD\n\n\nADD TWO\n\n         The Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.16\nper common share, payable September 20, 2004 to shareholders of record September\n7, 2004.\n\n         The Company will conduct a conference call on August 27 at 10:00 a.m.\nEST.

2003, the Company finalized an agreement to sell their domestic\nand European hosiery (Hosiery) operations for $7,500 plus reimbursement of\n$2,800 for costs incurred by the Company in connection with
