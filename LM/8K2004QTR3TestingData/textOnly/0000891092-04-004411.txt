(Nasdaq: CLCT), the leading provider of value-added grading and\nauthentication services and products to dealers and collectors of high-end\ncollectibles, today announced financial results for the fiscal year ended\nJune 30, 2004 with annual earnings of $1,730,000, or $0.27 per diluted share,\nwhich included income from continuing operations of $2,798,000, or $0.44 per\ndiluted share, and a loss from discontinued operations of $1,068,000, or a\nloss of $0.17 per diluted share. Net revenues were $26.4 million for the\nfiscal year 2004, up $6.1 million, or 30%, from $20.3 million for the fiscal\nyear 2003.\n\n    Financial Highlights:\n\n    Fourth Quarter 2004\n\n    -- Net revenues, which consist of grading and authentication services,\n       increased 31%, as the number of collectible coins graded increased by\n       30% and the total number of collectible units graded increased by\n       17% overall, in each case as compared to the fourth quarter last year.\n    -- Gross profit margin from increased to 67% from 64% over the\n       corresponding period last year.\n    -- Income from continuing operations increased to $1.3 million, or\n       $0.20 per diluted share from $0.5 million or $0.08 per diluted share in\n       the fourth quarter of 2003.\n    -- Net income, inclusive of a loss from discontinued (collectibles sales)\n       operations of $534,000, increased to $785,000 from a net loss of\n       $1.3 million or $0.21 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2003.\n\n    Year Ended June 30, 2004\n\n    -- Net revenues increased 30% to $26.4 million from $20.3 million for\n       fiscal 2003, as the number of collectible coins graded increased by\n       35%, and the total number of collectible units graded increased by\n       16% overall, in each case as compared to fiscal 2003.\n    -- Income from continuing operations increased to $2.8 million, or\n       $0.44 per diluted share from $736,000, or $0.12 per diluted share, in\n       fiscal 2003.\n    -- Net income, inclusive of a loss from discontinued operations of nearly\n       $1.1 million, increased to $1.7 million, or $0.27 per diluted share\n       from a net loss of $10.4 million (inclusive of a goodwill impairment\n       charge of $1.4 million and a cumulative effect of accounting change of\n       $8.9 million).\n    -- The Company ended fiscal 2004 with a strong cash position of\n       $21.5 million.\n\n    Fiscal Fourth Quarter Results\n    Continuing operations consist primarily of grading and authentication\nservices for coins, sportscards, stamps and autographs.\n    Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income. Income from continuing\noperations increased to $1.3 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the\nfourth quarter of 2004 from $791,000, or $0.13 per diluted share for the\nimmediately preceding quarter of 2004 and $508,000 or $0.08 per diluted share\nin the fourth quarter of 2003. However, discontinued operations, comprised of\nour collectibles sales businesses, recorded a loss of $534,000 or $0.08 per\ndiluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, as compared to a gain of\n$201,000 or $0.03 per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter of\nfiscal 2004 and a loss of $1.8 million or $0.29 per diluted share in the\nfourth quarter of 2003.\n    As a result, Collectors Universe recorded a net profit of $785,000, or\n$0.12 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2004, as compared to net\nprofit of $992,000 or $0.16 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal\n2004 and a net loss of $1.3 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, in the fourth\nquarter of 2003.\n    Net Revenues. Net revenues increased 31% to $7.8 million in the fourth\nquarter of 2004 from $5.9 million in the corresponding period last year.\nDriving the year-over-year top-line growth was a 17% increase in total\ncollectible units graded to 649,000 units compared with 553,000 units for the\nfourth quarter of 2003. The balance of the revenue increase was primarily due\nto a shift in the mix of collectibles being graded to a greater proportion of\ncollectible coins, which carry a higher average grading fee than sportscards.\n    Gross Profit and SG&A. Gross profit increased 37% to $5.2 million in the\nfourth quarter of fiscal 2004 from $3.8 million in the year-ago quarter, while\ngross profit margin improved to 67% from 64% in the fourth quarter last year.\nThe Company continued to demonstrate progress in improving operating\nefficiency. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased only\nslightly to $3.5 million in the 2004 fourth fiscal quarter from $3.4 million\nin the corresponding prior-year period, notwithstanding 31% increase in net\nrevenues. As a result, as a percentage of net revenues, SG&A declined to\n45% in the fourth quarter of 2004 from 57%, in the same quarter last year.\n\n    Fiscal Year 2004 Results\n    Income from Continuing Operations and Net Income.  Income from continuing\noperations increased to $2.8 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, in the\ntwelve months ended June 30, 2004, from $736,000, or $0.12 per diluted share,\nin the prior year. Discontinued operations incurred a loss of nearly\n$1.1 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the twelve months ended June 30,\n2004. As a result, we recorded net profits for fiscal 2004 of $1.7 million, or\n$0.27 per diluted share.\n    By comparison, for fiscal 2003, the Company incurred a net loss of\n$10.4 million, or $1.66 per diluted share. These results included a non-cash\ngoodwill impairment charge of $56,000 or $0.01 per diluted share, in\ncontinuing operations recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in\naccounting principle and a loss from discontinued operations of $11.1 million,\nor $1.77 per diluted share, which included an impairment charge of\n$1.4 million and cumulative effect of accounting change of $8.9 million.\n    Net Revenues. Net revenues increased 30% to $26.4 million in fiscal year\n2004 from $20.3 million for fiscal 2003. The increase in fiscal 2004 resulted\nfrom a 16% growth in total collectibles units graded and authenticated to\n2,323,000 units in 2004 from 2,002,000 last year and a shift in the mix of\ntotal items graded to a greater proportion of collectible coins.\n    Gross Profit and SG&A. Gross profit increased 37% to $17.3 million in\nfiscal year 2004, from $12.6 million last year, reflecting the increase in\nhigher margin coin grading submissions relative to sportscard and stamp\ngrading submissions. Year over year, the gross profit margin rose to 65% in\nfiscal 2004 from 62% in fiscal 2003, as the growth in revenues drove down the\nfixed elements in cost of sales as a percent of total revenues. SG&A increased\nby only 4% to $13.0 million in the 2004 fiscal period from $12.5 million in\nthe prior year, despite the 30% increase in net revenues in 2004. As a result,\nas a percentage of net revenues SG&A improved to 49% in fiscal 2004 from 62%\nin fiscal 2003.\n\n    Fiscal 2004 was a Turning Point\n    "Our 2004 fiscal year marked a turning point in our history as we made\nstrategic decisions to reposition the Company in order to take advantage of\nour leading brands in the service business of grading and authenticating\ncollectibles and to exit the commerce business in the buying, selling and\nauctioning collectibles," explained Chief Executive Officer Michael Haynes.\n"Additionally, we achieved our objectives to quickly and efficiently sell our\ndiscontinued operations during the second half of the fiscal year and in an\norderly fashion, liquidate substantially all of our inventories and collect\nour receivables from those operations. As a result of all of these efforts, we\nare reporting excellent annual earnings, and our continuing grading and\nauthentication operations, although currently smaller in annual revenue, have\nrecast the Company as one with lower volatility of revenues, lower balance\nsheet risk, higher gross margin, excellent brand recognition and focused\nmanagement, all for the purpose of growing our continuing businesses."\n\n    Improved Financial Condition\n    At June 30, 2004, Collectors Universe had cash and cash equivalents of\n$21.5 million compared with cash and cash equivalents of $4.5 million at\nfiscal year end June 30, 2003. Continuing operations provided net cash of\n$6.1 million in fiscal 2004, compared with $838,000 in the prior year. The two\nmain sources of the cash inflow in 2004 were $2.8 million net income from\ncontinuing operations and $1.2 million of refundable income taxes. Investing\nactivities provided $1,852,000 in fiscal 2004 compared to cash used of\n$294,000 in the prior year. Financing activities generated cash flows of\n$924,000 compared to $16,000 in fiscal 2003.\n    In addition, discontinued operations provided $8.1 million cash in fiscal\n2004 in contrast to a cash outflow of $1.0 million in 2003.\n    Inventories at June 30, 2004 totaled $452,000, as compared with\n$180,000 at the end of fiscal 2003.\n    Assets totaled $33.7 million at June 30, 2004, compared with $32.3 million\nat fiscal year end 2003, and assets of discontinued operations held for sale\naccounted for $1.4 million and $16 million, respectively, of the total.\n    Total stockholders\' equity was $29 million at June 30, 2004, compared with\n$26.3 million at June 30, 2003. The Company currently has no debt.\n\n    Fiscal 2005 Outlook\n    Mr. Haynes stated, "As we stand at the threshold of the initial year of\nour new strategy, we are enthusiastic about a return to our founding premise\nof ending \'buyer beware\' in the markets we serve and extending our excellent\nvalue proposition inherent in our services into other markets for collectibles\nand high value assets. Our cash position provides us with a significant\nresource for enhancing our current market share and continuing our momentum\nalong with the prospect for careful and selective acquisitions that will\nenable us to enter new markets where third party validation can add\nsignificant value and facilitate transactions."\n\n    Conference Call and Webcast\n    Management will host a conference call and simultaneous webcast today at\n8:00 a.m. Pacific/11:00 a.m. Eastern to discuss fourth-quarter and fiscal 2004\noperating performance.

The Collectors Universe brands are among the\nstrongest and best known in their respective markets. The Company grades and\nauthenticates collectible coins, sportscards, stamps, and autographs. The\nCompany also compiles and publishes authoritative information about\ncollectible sportscards and sports memorabilia, United States and world coins,\nand entertainment memorabilia. This information is accessible to collectors\nand dealers at the Company\'s web site, www.collectors.com, and is also\npublished in print.\n\n    Forward-Looking Statements\n    This news release contains statements regarding our expectations about our\nfuture financial performance that are "forward-looking statements" as defined\nin the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking\nstatements can be identified by the use of words such as "believe," "expect,"\n"anticipate," "intend," "plan," "estimate," "project," or words of similar\nmeaning, or future or conditional verbs such as "will," "would," "should,"\n"could," or "may." Our actual results and business in the future may differ,\npossibly materially, from our current expectations as set forth in the forward\nlooking statements contained in this release due to a number of risks and\nuncertainties. Those risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:\nchanges in general economic conditions, and changes in conditions in the\ncollectibles markets in which we operate, such as a possible decline in the\npopularity of some high-end collectibles, either of which could reduce the\nvolume of grading submissions and, therefore, the grading fees we generate; a\nlack of diversity in our sources of revenues and, more particularly, our\ndependence on collectible coin grading for a significant percentage of our\ntotal revenues, which makes us vulnerable to declines in revenues and income\nshould there be declines in collectibles grading submissions generally or,\nmore particularly, in collectible coin submissions which can be caused by a\ndecline in the value of precious metals over which we do not have control; and\nour dependence on a limited number of key management personnel the loss of any\nof which could adversely affect future financial performance. Certain of these\nrisks and uncertainties, in addition to other risks, are more fully described\nin the Company\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30,\n2003, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition,\nalthough we believe that our strategy to exit the commerce segment of our\nbusiness and focus substantially all of our resources on our grading and\nservices segment will better enable us to achieve improvements in the\nprofitability, there is no assurance that our strategy will prove to be\nsuccessful. Among other things, one consequence of our strategy is that there\nwill be a significant decline in our revenues. As a result, our profitability\nwill suffer if we are unable to reduce our general and administrative expenses\nto bring them in line with our lower revenue base. Also, there is a practical\nlimit on the amount by which expenses can be reduced as a means of improving\nprofitability. As a result, our success in the future will depend as well on\nour ability to achieve internal growth in our grading businesses and to find\nand take advantage of opportunities to acquire other businesses that provide\nvalue added services to the collectibles markets. There is no assurance that\nwe will be able to achieve such growth and growth by acquisition presents a\nnumber of risks including an inability to integrate newly acquired businesses\ninto existing operations successfully and the potential that such acquisitions\nwill result in increased operating costs that will adversely affect operating\nincome and profits.\n    These forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this news\nrelease, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise the\nforward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future\nevents or otherwise.\n\n                  COLLECTORS UNIVERSE, INC.
