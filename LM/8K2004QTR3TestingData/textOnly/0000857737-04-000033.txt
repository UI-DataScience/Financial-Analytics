Reports Second Quarter Net Income of $518,000 Versus Loss of $3.8\nMillion in Prior Year\n\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 9, 2004--Candie\'s Inc. (NASDAQ: CAND):\n\n    --  EPS $0.02 versus loss of $0.15 in prior year quarter\n\n    --  Licensing SG&A expenses reduced from $6.4 million to $1.9 million.\n\nCandie\'s Inc. (NASDAQ: CAND) (the "Company") today announced its results for the\nsecond quarter and six months ended July 31, 2004 of its fiscal year ending\nJanuary 31, 2005. The Company reported consolidated net income of $518,000 for\nthe quarter or $0.02 per diluted share, as compared to a loss of $3.8 million or\n$0.15 per diluted share for the prior year quarter. Licensing income for the\nquarter increased to $2.1 million from $1.8 million in the prior year quarter\nand SG&A expenses in the licensing segment decreased by 70.8 % from $6.4 million\nto $1.9 million.\n\nAs previously announced, as of the end of Fiscal 2004, the Company completed the\ntransition of its wholesale and retail footwear business to the new licensing\nmodel. The Company is in the process of transitioning its jeanswear operations\nto TKO Apparel Licensing, Inc, which is the new licensee for BONGO(R) jeans and\nwhich will also purchase the Company\'s wholly-owned jeanswear subsidiary,\nUnzipped Apparel, LLC ("Unzipped") for a purchase price to be based on the\ntangible net worth of Unzipped at the time of closing. The jeanswear license\nwill begin generating licensing income as of the third quarter of this fiscal\nyear. Chairman and CEO Neil Cole said "We are definitely moving in the right\ndirection. Looking ahead, the conversion of BONGO jeanswear to a license, along\nwith the CANDIE\'S(R) footwear license, will generate additional royalties and\nprofits and eliminate jeanswear SG&A expenses. We are pleased with the\ncontinuing popularity of our powerful BONGO and CANDIE\'S brands and look forward\nto increased income and profitability as we move into next year."\n\nFor the six months ended July 31, 2004 the Company reported consolidated net\nincome of $551,000 versus a loss of $3.0 million in the prior year six month\nperiod. Licensing income increased over 30% to $4.0 million from $3.0 million in\nthe comparable prior year period and SG&A expenses in the licensing segment\ndecreased by 71.7% from $13.8 million to $3.9 million.\n\nThe six month results reflect an increase of $5.5 million in sales and cost of\nsales in the first quarter ended April 30, 2004 from the Company\'s Bright Star\nsubsidiary to recognize, as gross sales, certain revenues previously recorded as\nnet sales. This change will be reported in an amended 10Q filing for the quarter\nended April 30, 2004. This reclassification does not affect the previously\nreported gross profit, operating income, net income or earnings per share.\n\nShareholders are invited to listen to the conference call scheduled for today at\n10:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time. The call will be webcast live via the Internet\nand can be accessed by logging on to www.candiesinc.com and clicking on the\n"Live Webcast" link on the "Investor\'s Overview" page.
