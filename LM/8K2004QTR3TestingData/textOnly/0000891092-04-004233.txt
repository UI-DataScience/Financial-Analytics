M. Smucker Company Announces Record First Quarter Results\n\n      - Significant Increase in Sales and Earnings Due to Acquisition of\n        Multifoods\n\n      - Integration of Multifoods\' Operations on Track\n\n      - Board of Directors Authorizes Share Repurchase\n\n      - Company Confirms Fiscal Year 2005 Outlook\n\n    ORRVILLE, Ohio, Aug. 25 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- The J. M. Smucker Company\n(NYSE: SJM) today announced results for the first quarter ended July 31, 2004,\nof its 2005 fiscal year. Results for the quarter include the operations of\nInternational Multifoods Corporation (Multifoods) since the acquisition closing\ndate of June 18, 2004.\n\n    As previously announced, the Company sold its Australian based Henry Jones\nFoods (HJF) business and is planning to divest the U.S. foodservice business\nacquired as part of the Multifoods transaction. Results for both of these\nbusinesses are reported as discontinued operations and all prior periods have\nbeen restated. Quarterly restated results for fiscal year 2004 are included.\n\n    First Quarter Results\n\n    Company sales were $415.8 million for the first quarter of 2005, up 22\npercent compared to $341.9 million in the first quarter of 2004. The acquired\nMultifoods\' businesses contributed $75.5 million to sales in the first quarter\nof 2005. Excluding the contribution of the Multifoods\' brands, higher sales of\nbranded products were offset by declines in non-branded industrial sales. Income\nfrom continuing operations was $27.5 million, an increase of nine percent over\n$25.2 million in last year\'s first quarter, while earnings per diluted share for\nthe quarter were $0.50 in both years, due to the additional shares issued in the\nMultifoods transaction.\n\n    Improved margins on the Company\'s existing business and the addition of\nMultifoods were the primary causes for the earnings increase.  These increases\nwere partially offset by higher interest expense, associated with debt related\nto the acquisition.  Income from continuing operations for the first quarter\nof 2005 included pretax merger and integration costs of $2.8 million or $0.03\nper diluted share and restructuring charges of $3.0 million or $0.04 per\ndiluted share.  Income from continuing operations for the first quarter of\n2004 included restructuring charges of $3.2 million or $0.04 per diluted\nshare.  Excluding these merger and integration and restructuring costs, the\nCompany\'s income from continuing operations was up 14 percent and diluted\nearnings per share would have been $0.57 and $0.54, in the first quarter of\n2005 and 2004, respectively.\n\n    "We closed the acquisition of Multifoods this quarter and are pleased to\nsee its contribution reflected in our first quarter results.  With the\naddition of Multifoods, we have added an impressive array of leading, North\nAmerican icon brands to the family of Smucker," said Tim Smucker, chairman and\nco-chief executive officer.  "We have already started to invest behind these\nbrands and the integration of the businesses is well underway."\n\n    Net income for the first quarter of 2005 was up 27 percent to\n$32.8 million or $0.60 per diluted share, compared to last year\'s first\nquarter net income of $25.8 million or $0.51 per diluted share.  Included in\nthis quarter\'s net income was income from discontinued operations of\n$5.4 million or $0.10 per diluted share, which includes the gain on the\nCompany\'s sale of its HJF business.  Income from discontinued operations was\n$0.5 million or $0.01 per diluted share last year.\n\n    The Company uses earnings from continuing operations, excluding\nrestructuring and merger and integration costs, as a key performance measure\nof results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally.\nThese non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of\nfinancial results in accordance with GAAP.  Rather, management believes the\npresentation of results excluding such charges offers additional information\nto investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations and\nprovides a more comprehensive understanding of the financial results.  A\nreconciliation of non-GAAP measures to earnings from continuing operations for\nthe current quarter is included in the "Financial Highlights" table.\n\n    Scottsville Plant\n\n    During the first quarter of 2005, construction of the Smucker\'s\nUncrustables(R) plant in Scottsville, Kentucky, was completed and the plant\ncommenced operations.  The new facility has experienced a longer ramp-up\nschedule than originally anticipated.  The Company incurred approximately\n$2.8 million or $0.03 per diluted share in costs associated with the start-up\nduring the first quarter of 2005.  These costs consist primarily of additional\nlabor, materials, and under-absorbed overhead.  The Company expects to incur\nadditional start-up costs for the year, with a majority of the costs to be\nincurred during the second quarter.  The Company plans to offset these costs\nwith cost reductions across the organization, and is not changing its fiscal\nyear earnings guidance.\n\n    "We view this ramp-up issue as a short-term hurdle and continue to be\nexcited about Uncrustables as a growth platform for the Company over the next\nseveral years," commented Richard Smucker, president, co-chief executive\nofficer and chief financial officer.  "We continue to support Uncrustables\nwith additional promotion and marketing activities this year and anticipate a\nsignificant year-over-year sales increase."\n\n    Margins\n\n    Operating income in the first quarter increased 16 percent from the\ncomparable quarter last year, while operating margin decreased from\n12.1 percent in the first quarter of 2004 to 11.6 percent in the first quarter\nof 2005.  The increase in operating income was attributed to the overall\nrevenue growth.  The Company\'s gross margin increased slightly from\n34.6 percent in the first quarter of last year to 34.8 percent in the first\nquarter of this year, due primarily to the impact of the Company\'s supply\nchain optimization project, favorable manufacturing costs, and a decrease in\nrestructuring charges.\n\n    The Company continues to see escalating raw material costs.  Increases in\nthe cost of certain fruit varieties and rising fuel costs, which primarily\naffect packaging components as well as energy costs, are the key contributors.\nThe Company expects to offset these increases in raw material costs over the\nremainder of the year through a variety of cost reduction and pricing\nmeasures.\n\n    Selling, distribution, and administrative (SD&A) expenses as a percentage\nof sales declined slightly from 22.0 percent in the first quarter of 2004 to\n21.9 percent in the current quarter.  Marketing and selling expenses decreased\nas a percent of sales despite an absolute dollar increase of 11 percent.  This\nwas somewhat offset by administrative costs being incurred at the former\nMultifoods\' headquarters in Minnesota, which is expected to be closed by the\nend of April 2005.\n\n    Interest expense increased from $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2004\nto $4.5 million in the first quarter of 2005 as a result of an increase in the\nCompany\'s debt outstanding associated with the acquisition of Multifoods.  The\nCompany\'s first quarter earnings benefited from a decrease in the effective\ntax rate from 37.5 percent in 2004 to 36.6 percent this quarter.\n\n    Segment Performance\n\n    U.S. Retail Market\n\n    The U.S. retail market segment is comprised of the Company\'s consumer and\nconsumer oils and baking business areas.  Prior to the acquisition of\nMultifoods, this segment represented the domestic sales of Smucker\'s(R),\nJif(R), and Crisco(R) branded products to retail customers.  With the addition\nof Multifoods, domestic sales of Pillsbury(R), Hungry Jack(R), Martha\nWhite(R), and Pet(R) branded products to retail customers are now included in\nthis segment.\n\n    Sales in the U.S. retail market segment for the first quarter of 2005 were\n$288.1 million, compared to $248.3 million in the first quarter of 2004, an\nincrease of 16 percent.  The Multifoods\' brands contributed $39.9 million of\nthe segment\'s sales in the quarter.\n\n    During the first quarter of 2005, sales in the consumer area increased\n11 percent over the first quarter of last year, driven by growth in the\nSmucker\'s and Jif brands, the addition of Hungry Jack, and continued growth of\nthe Company\'s Uncrustables products.  In the consumer oils and baking area,\nsales were up 29 percent due to the addition of the Pillsbury and Martha White\nbrands.  Crisco branded sales in retail were down approximately six percent\nduring the quarter, an improvement from the fourth quarter of last year.  In\naddition, non-branded industrial oil sales were down from the prior year.\n\n\n    Special Markets\n\n    The special markets segment is comprised of the international,\nfoodservice, beverage, industrial, and Canada strategic business areas.  The\nCanadian business acquired from Multifoods has been combined with the\nCompany\'s previous Canadian business to form the new Canada business area.\n\n    Sales in the special markets segment were $127.7 million in the first\nquarter of 2005, compared to $93.6 million for the first quarter of 2004.\nMultifoods contributed $35.6 million of the segment\'s sales in the quarter.\nSales in the Canada and foodservice business areas were up over the prior\nyear\'s first quarter.  Excluding the Multifoods sales and planned declines in\nthe industrial and international businesses, special markets increased four\npercent in the first quarter of 2005 compared to the comparable period last\nyear.\n\n    Foodservice sales, which exclude the Multifoods\' U.S. foodservice\nbusiness, were up four percent in the first quarter of 2005, compared to last\nyear\'s first quarter.  Growth in the Company\'s traditional portion control\nbusiness and increased Uncrustables sales in the school market contributed to\nthe overall increase in foodservice sales.\n\n    Beverage sales were down three percent in the first quarter of 2005\ncompared to the first quarter of 2004, due mostly to a decrease in sales of\nSanta Cruz Organic(R) products.  Availability of certain organic raw materials\nwas the primary cause of the decline.  Sales of R. W. Knudsen Family(R)\nproducts and the non-branded business segment were up for the first quarter of\n2005 versus the first quarter of last year.\n\n    Finally, industrial sales were down 14 percent in the first quarter of\n2005 compared to the prior year\'s first quarter.  The decrease in the\nindustrial area was due to the final phase of the Company\'s plan to exit low\nmargin contracts.  Approximately $3.4 million in sales of now discontinued\nbusiness were included in last year\'s first quarter.  Sales that are planned\nto be discontinued are estimated at $11 million for the entire fiscal year.\n\n    Share Repurchase\n\n    At its most recent meeting, the Company\'s Board of Directors authorized a\nshare repurchase plan.  Under the plan, the Company is authorized to purchase\nup to one million common shares.  The buyback program will be implemented\nthroughout the fiscal year and beyond, at management\'s discretion.\n\n    Outlook for Fiscal 2005\n\n    The Company confirmed its objective to increase its 2005 diluted earnings\nper share from continuing operations by its long-term growth goal of eight\npercent, taking into consideration the previously discussed cost increases.\nThis equates to an earnings growth rate of approximately 24 percent in 2005.\nAn increase of approximately eight million shares outstanding resulting from\nthe Multifoods acquisition accounts for the difference in these growth rates.\nThis earnings goal excludes the impacts of restructuring, merger and\nintegration costs, and gains and losses on sales of assets.\n\n    With the decision to divest the Multifoods\' U.S. foodservice business and\ntreat it as a discontinued operation, forecasted sales for 2005 have been\nrevised to approximately $2.1 billion.\n\n    Earnings for 2005 will include approximately $20 million or $0.20 per\ndiluted share in merger and integration costs and approximately $6.5 million\nor $0.07 per diluted share in restructuring costs.  This is an increase over\nthe previously announced estimate of restructuring charges and primarily\nreflects the Company\'s first quarter decision to relocate some production from\nits Salinas, California, facility to plants in Orrville, Ohio, and Memphis,\nTennessee.\n\n    Conference Call\n\n    The Company will conduct an earnings conference call and webcast on\nWednesday, August 25, 2004, at 8:30 a.m. E.T.
