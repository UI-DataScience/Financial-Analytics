Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\n\n         On August 26,  2004,  VA Software  Corporation  ("VA  Software"  or the\n"Company")  issued a press  release  regarding  its  financial  results  for the\nquarter  and fiscal  year ended July 31,  2004.  A copy of the press  release is\nfurnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and a copy of the financial  statements\nincluded  in the press  release  are filed  separately  as Exhibit  99.2 to this\nreport.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\n\n         To  supplement  its  consolidated  financial  statements  presented  in\naccordance with GAAP, VA Software uses non-GAAP  measures of operating  results,\nnet income and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP\nto exclude certain expenses.  These non-GAAP adjustments are provided to enhance\nthe user\'s overall  understanding of the Company\'s current financial performance\nand its  prospects  for the  future.  Specifically,  the  Company  believes  the\nnon-GAAP results provide useful  information to both management and investors by\nexcluding  certain  expenses  that it believes  are not  indicative  of its core\noperating results.  In addition,  because the Company has historically  reported\nnon-GAAP  results to the  investment  community,  it believes  the  inclusion of\nnon-GAAP numbers provides consistency in its financial reporting. Further, these\nnon-GAAP results are one of the primary indicators the Company\'s management uses\nfor  planning  and  forecasting  in future  periods.  The  presentation  of this\nadditional  information  is not  meant to be  considered  in  isolation  or as a\nsubstitute  for  results  prepared  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States.\n\nItem 9.01.

SourceForge\n     Enterprise  Edition  4.1  allows  customers  to  lower  development  costs,\n     increase  development  efficiency,  and improve development  visibility and\n     control beyond the results provided by earlier releases of the product.\n\no    OSTG.  Formerly known as OSDN, OSTG (Open Source  Technology  Group) is the\n     leading  network  of  news  and  information  sites  for  IT  managers  and\n     development  professionals.  During  the fourth  quarter,  in  addition  to\n     announcing its new name, OSTG relaunched  several of its IT-focused  sites.\n     The name change to OSTG reflects the company\'s  long-term  strategy to meet\n     the evolving information needs of its growing audience,  and address market\n     trends driving the rapid adoption of Open Source  technologies for business\n     and the desktop. For the tenth-consecutive  quarter,  based on composition,\n     OSTG has been named the number one network for delivering visitors who look\n     for technology  news online and for  delivering  visitors who make software\n     purchases online,  according to the  Nielsen//NetRatings  @Plan Summer 2004\n     Report.\n\n     OSTG continues to experience rapid traffic growth and increased advertising\n     revenue while  maintaining its commitment to a  community-based  technology\n     audience   working   with  a   range   of   platforms   and   technologies.\n     SourceForge.net(R), the world\'s largest repository of Open Source software,\n     continues  to break new  records  with over  900,000  registered  users and\n     86,000  projects.  Two  Microsoft  projects  released  under the  company\'s\n     "Shared Source  Initiative" are in the top 10% of active projects hosted on\n     SourceForge.net.  The network as a whole  serves more than 250 million page\n     views,  and 16 million unique visitors  monthly.* This ranks OSTG among the\n     top  technology  networks  both in  terms  of size  and  purchasing  power.\n     Advertisers   and  sponsors  of  the  network   include   Microsoft,   IBM,\n     Hewlett-Packard,  Intel, Red Hat, Legato, AMD, Sun Microsystems,  Interland\n     and Rackspace.\n\no    OSTG   Strategic   Relationships.    OSTG   announced   several   strategic\n     relationships  designed to expand its reach beyond historical  advertisers.\n     On August 5, 2004,  OSTG  announced a marketing  and sales  agreement  with\n     International  Data Group (IDG),  where IDG\'s Global Solutions\' sales force\n     will sell  advertising  on OSTG\'s  network  of sites  giving  international\n     technology  advertisers  more  media  options  and  exposing  them  to  the\n     fast-growing  global open source  community.  On August 17, OSTG  announced\n     that it would  expand  its site and Web  search  capabilities  with  Yahoo!\n     Search  Technology and add  contextually-relevant  paid  advertising to its\n     sites using Overture Services\' Content Match product.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\n\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting  principles,  or GAAP, VA Software uses non-GAAP  financial  results.\nNon-GAAP net income and earnings per share  exclude  amortization  of intangible\nassets and deferred  stock  compensation,  impairment  of  goodwill,  intangible\n\n', u"\n\nassets and other long-term assets,  remeasurement of warrant liability,  as well\nas restructuring costs and other special charges. These non-GAAP adjustments are\nprovided  to  enhance  the user's  overall  understanding  of current  financial\nperformance and prospects for the future. Specifically, VA believes the non-GAAP\nresults provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding\ncertain  non-recurring  expenses  that VA believes  are not  indicative  of core\noperating results.  In addition,  because VA has historically  reported non-GAAP\nresults to the  investment  community,  VA believes  the  inclusion  of non-GAAP\nnumbers provides  consistency in financial  reporting.  Further,  these non-GAAP\nresults are one of the  primary  indicators  management  uses for  planning  and\nforecasting in future periods. The method VA uses to produce non-GAAP results is\nnot  computed  according  to GAAP,  is likely to differ from the methods used by\nother companies and should not be regarded as a substitute for results  prepared\nin  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in the United\nStates.\n\nAbout VA Software\n\nVA Software (Nasdaq: LNUX) is at the center of today's technology revolution and\nincites  innovation  by  empowering  the  IT  and  developer   communities  with\ninformation,  community support and software.
