(Nasdaq:\nCHLN)  announced  today it had a net  revenue of  $30,573,000  and net income of\n$58,000  during  the  first six  months of 2004  compared  to a net  revenue  of\n$29,012,000 and a net income of $504,000 in the same period of 2003.\n\n"This quarter we have already begun to see the positive effects of our three new\nwineries on our bottom line," said President and CEO Tom Selfridge. "The current\nreleases of Provenance  Vineyards are selling well in the marketplace;  in April\nwe had the debut of the Orogeny Vineyards Pinot Noir from Russian River Valley\'s\nGreen Valley and in May we celebrated the inaugural release of Hewitt Vineyard\'s\nestate Cabernet Sauvignon from the Rutherford Bench.  Thanks to these new wines,\nplus our efforts with our other wineries,  we had an increase in net revenues of\n$1,561,000 in the first six months of 2004,  compared to that same time frame in\n2003."\n\nCommenting  on the  results  for the first  half of 2004,  Selfridge  said,  "As\npreviously announced, on May 17th we received a proposal from Domaines Barons de\nRothschild  (Lafite)  SCA  (DBR) to  purchase  the  company.  We have  formed an\nindependent  special  committee  of the board of the  directors  to evaluate the\nproposal,  and the  committee  has  retained  outside  attorneys  and  financial\nadvisors to assist its evaluation of the DBR proposal.  If we subtract the costs\nassociated  with the special  committee  and other efforts  associated  with the\nproposal, we would have posted a higher profit of $370,000 for the first half of\n2004."\n\nSelfridge  added,  "The proposed  purchase is just that - a proposal.  This will\ntake some time to sort out and, in the meantime, all of the employees at Chalone\nWine Group are focusing on producing and selling  great wine.  During these very\ncompetitive  times in the marketplace,  we are continuing to keep our eye on the\nball."\n\n', u"\n\nChalone Wine Group, Ltd. is a Napa-based company specializing in premium red and\nwhite varietal  wines.
