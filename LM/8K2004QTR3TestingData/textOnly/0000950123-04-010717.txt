REPORTS STRONG SECOND QUARTER RESULTS\n      ~ COMPANY POSTS 28% SALES GAIN OVER LY, INCLUDING EBEL ACQUISITION ~\n\n         PARAMUS, NJ - SEPTEMBER 8, 2004 -- MOVADO GROUP, INC. (NYSE: MOV),\ntoday announced second quarter results for the period ended July 31, 2004. These\nresults include the Ebel business, which was acquired on March 1, 2004. All\nshare data has been adjusted to reflect a two-for-one stock split distributed to\nshareholders on June 25, 2004.\n\nSECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2005\n\no    Net sales increased 27.8% to $97.8 million from $76.5 million last year.\n     The acquisition of Ebel accounted for net sales of $9.4 million.\n\no    Comparable store sales increased 11.8% at the Company's Movado boutiques.\n\no    Gross margin was 59.3% this year compared to 61.7% last year. The\n     acquisition of Ebel had a negative effect on gross margins in the second\n     quarter of fiscal 2005 of approximately 0.7%.\n\no    Operating profit was $8.7 million versus $8.8 million in the year-ago\n     period. The acquisition of Ebel resulted in a $1.7 million decrease in\n     operating profit in the second quarter of fiscal 2005.\n\no    Net income was $7.1 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to net\n     income of $5.8 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the prior year\n     period. Second quarter net income includes the dilutive impact of Ebel,\n     which was partially offset by the previously announced gain of $835,000, or\n     $0.03 per diluted share, associated with a legal settlement the Company\n     reached with Swiss Army Brands. The combined effect of these two items\n     reduced net income in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 by approximately\n     $500,000, or $0.02 per diluted share.\n\n\n                                    - more -\n\n", u'\n\n\nFIRST HALF FISCAL 2005\n\no    Net sales increased 25.8% to $172.0 million from $136.7 million last year.\n     The acquisition of Ebel accounted for net sales of $12.8 million.\n\no    Comparable store sales increased 18.4% at the Company\'s Movado boutiques.\n\no    Gross margin was 58.9% compared to 61.2%. The acquisition of Ebel had a\n     negative effect on gross margins in the first half of fiscal 2005 of\n     approximately 0.8%.\n\no    Operating profit was $10.5 million versus $10.8 million in the year-ago\n     period. The acquisition of Ebel resulted in a $4.1 million decrease in\n     operating profit in the first half of fiscal 2005.\n\no    Net income was $7.8 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to net\n     income of $6.6 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in the prior year\n     period. Net income for the first half of fiscal 2005 includes the dilutive\n     impact of Ebel, which was partially offset by the aforementioned gain\n     associated with a legal settlement the Company reached with Swiss Army\n     Brands during the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The combined effect of\n     these two items reduced net income in the first half of fiscal 2005 by\n     approximately $2.3 million, or $0.09 per diluted share.\n\n         Efraim Grinberg, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Our\nsolid results during the second quarter reflect strength across our brands,\ngeographic regions, and channels of business. Movado boutiques continue to gain\ntraction, with double-digit comparable store sales increases posted in the\nsecond quarter. Our overall success continues to be driven by the execution of\nour strategy to support our brands with innovative advertising campaigns, to\ndeliver unique and compelling product assortments, and to maintain an intense\nfocus on our customers."\n\n         Mr. Grinberg continued, "The integration and revitalization of the Ebel\nbrand continues and we are encouraged by our progress thus far. We are looking\nforward to the important second half of the year when our customers will begin\nto see the impact of our efforts to-date. On the advertising front, we have\nlaunched a powerful image-building global campaign featuring internationally\nrecognized supermodel, Claudia Schiffer. This campaign, along with a new Ebel\nmen\'s campaign, has a prominent presence in the key fall fashion publications.\nWe also expect Ebel to benefit from exciting new products and refined marketing\nprograms we have planned for the second half of the year, which represent a\nreturn to the successful roots of the brand and truly convey the luxury image\nand rich heritage of Ebel."\n\n         Rick Cote, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer,\nstated, "Our business is strong, and we are poised for growth across all areas\nof our organization. We continue to be focused on the fundamentals of our\nbusiness and our investments are bearing fruit. Throughout the first half of\nthis year, top line initiatives including product development efforts, marketing\nand advertising, drove consumer interest and translated into strong sales gains.\nThese efforts were supported and enhanced by our efficient operating\n\n\n                                    - more -\n', u'\n\n\n\n\nstructure, allowing us to generate strong bottom line results, despite the\nplanned dilutive impact of the Ebel acquisition. Additionally, our strong\nbalance sheet and focus on cash flow management ensure we have the ability to\ncontinue to appropriately invest across all of our businesses and capitalize on\ngrowth initiatives."\n\n          The Company anticipates diluted earnings per share for the full year\nto range between $0.95 and $1.00, including the dilutive impact of Ebel and the\nlegal settlement gain. The Company plans fiscal year 2005 sales to be\napproximately $410 million, an increase in excess of 20% from last year,\nincluding sales from Ebel which are now projected to range between $40 million\nand $45 million.\n\n         The Company\'s management will host a conference call today, September\n8th at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
