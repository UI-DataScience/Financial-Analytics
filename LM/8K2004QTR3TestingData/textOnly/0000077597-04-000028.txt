LOUIS, September 2, 2004 - Spartech Corporation (NYSE:SEH)\nannounced today increases in both sales and earnings for its third quarter\nwhich ended July 31, 2004.\n\n     Spartech\'s Chairman, President and CEO, Bradley B. Buechler, reported\nthat sales for the Company\'s fiscal third quarter were $288.0 million, an\nincrease of 21% from the $238.9 million reported in the third quarter of last\nyear.  The Company\'s fiscal 2004 third quarter operating earnings were $24.9\nmillion or 29% greater than the $19.3 million reported for the same three\nmonth period last year.  Third quarter 2004 net earnings were $11.7 million,\nor $0.36 per diluted share, compared to the $8.1 million, or $0.28 per\ndiluted share, reported in 2003.\n\n     Commenting on the results, Mr. Buechler stated, "Our consolidated sales\nvolume for the third quarter was exceptionally strong. Excellent internal\ngrowth of 15% resulted in more than 350 million pounds being shipped during\nthe period.20% greater than last years\' similar quarter.  Operating Earnings\nPer Pound Shipped - one of our key economic performance indicators - also\nrecorded a solid increase during the third quarter as our conversion cost\ncontainment efforts assisted us in moving this measure to 7.1 cents per\npound shipped as compared to the 6.6 cents per pound shipped in the third\nquarter of fiscal 2003."\n\nSEGMENT RESULTS\n\nCustom Sheet & Rollstock - Our Custom Sheet & Rollstock group, which\nrepresents approximately two-thirds of the Company\'s consolidated sales saw\nvolume (in pounds) increase by 30% in the third quarter of fiscal 2004.  The\nmajority (20%) came from strong internal growth in primarily the packaging,\nappliance and building & construction markets.  Our fourth quarter 2003\nacquisition of TriEnda\'s sheet extrusion operation, along with price/mix\nchanges made up the balance of the increase in sales dollars.  The segment\'s\noperating margin improved modestly during this year\'s third quarter.advancing\nto 11.2 cents per pound from 11.0 cents per pound last year.as unprecedented\nraw material price increases offset most of the group\'s benefits from\nconversion cost reductions and its strong capacity\nutilization rate (approximately 90%).\n\n     (In Millions)\n                               Third Quarter         First Nine Months\n                             2004         2003       2004      2003\n          Net Sales          $196.5       $158.9     $545.5     $462.0\n                             ======       ======     ======     ======\n          Operating          $ 21.0       $ 16.0     $ 58.0     $ 46.6\n          Earnings\n                             ======       ======     ======     ======\n\n                                   -more-\nSPARTECH CORPORATION\nTHIRD QUARTER FISCAL 2004 RESULTS & QUARTERLY DIVIDEND\nADD 2\n\n\n     Color & Specialty Compounds - Sales volume for the Company\'s Color &\n     Specialty Compounds group rose by 11% in the third quarter, with strong\n     increases coming from three of the five major markets served by this\n     segment.packaging, transportation and appliance.  Operating earnings\n     per pound shipped also generated a double-digit increase\n     (18%).advancing from 3.4 cents per pound last year to 4.0 cents per\n     pound in the third quarter of this year.as the group rebounded from an\n     extremely soft third quarter in 2003.  The group\'s recent positive\n     trend in internal growth over the past two quarters gives us\n     encouragement that once the current resin market stabilizes or prices\n     roll back to more reasonable levels, our traditional operating margins\n     for this group will return.\n\n     (In Millions)\n                              Third Quarter        First Nine Months\n                             2004       2003        2004        2003\n          Net Sales         $  75.1      $  64.3     $219.4      $192.2\n                            =======      =======     ======      ======\n          Operating         $   6.2      $   4.7     $ 18.5      $ 15.2\n          Earnings\n                            =======      =======     ======      ======\n\n     Molded & Profile Products -The Company\'s Molded & Profile Products\n     segment generated modest sales and earnings increases, in the 5-6%\n     range, during the third quarter.

Despite this strong demand, volatile crude oil\nprices have resulted in increasing raw material costs that could continue to\nput pressure on material margins.  Factoring in these favorable sales trends\nand the raw material price volatility, our current guidance for fiscal 2004\nis a range of $1.33 to $1.38 earnings per fully diluted share.  Our\nmanagement team is very positive about the long-term outlook for our\nCompany, considering.(1) the positive trend in our internal volume growth\nrate (8%) during the past 12 months; (2) the ongoing implementation of our\nlean manufacturing effort; (3) our senior management realignment in March\npositioning us for the Company\'s next chapter of growth; (4) the opening of\nour new Product Development Center in June; and (5) the increased number of\nsolid expansion opportunities, both domestic (such as our recently announced\nagreement to purchase three divisions of VPI) and now global as well.we\nbelieve our Company is strategically positioned for some sustainable growth\nover the next several years."\n\n\n                                   -more-\nSPARTECH CORPORATION\nTHIRD QUARTER FISCAL 2004 RESULTS & QUARTERLY DIVIDEND\nADD 3\n\n\n\n     Finally, Mr. Buechler announced that the Company\'s Board of Directors\ndeclared a third quarter cash dividend of 11 cents per common share, payable\non September 30, 2004, to common shareholders of record on September 16,\n2004.\n\n     A live internet broadcast of Spartech\'s conference call regarding\nfiscal 2004 third quarter earnings can be accessed at 11:00a.m. Eastern time\non Thursday, September 2, on the Company\'s website, http://www.spartech.com.\nAn archived replay of the call will also be available on the website for 90\ndays.
