Spector,  stated that\nresults went more or less according to plan with continued  growth and improving\nmargins  resulting in return to  profitability in the landscaping  segment.  The\nlawn and garden  segment  showed an increase in gross  margins  versus the prior\nyear, even though the Company has experienced higher costs of transportation and\nraw  materials  due to the  higher  cost of oil.  The  plant  segment,  however,\ncontinued  to show  losses  with  declining  sales due a lack of plant  material\navailable  for sale as a result of the  closing  of the  Company's  Barranquitas\nfacility  last year.  Increased  plant segment sales and profits are expected to\nbegin during the fourth  quarter as new plant  material  becomes  available  for\nsale.\n\n\n\n", u'\n\n\n\nDuring  the  second  quarter,  public  hearings  were held with  respect  to the\nrequested  zoning  variances  related the proposed  housing  project in Arecibo,\nPuerto  Rico.  There was very little  opposition  to our  project.  Accordingly,\nalthough no assurance can be given, the Company remains optimistic to it will be\nable to obtain.\n\nThe unconsolidated  joint venture (Salinas Holdings,  Inc.) continues to perform\nwell.  Sales were  adversely  impacted  during the second  quarter  due to heavy\nrains.  The weather has improved and sales, as well as large orders have already\nbeen received for delivery during the third quarter.\n\nMargo  Caribe,  Inc. and its  subsidiaries  (collectively,  the  "Company")  are\nactively  pursuing  orders for a number of new product  lines that the Company\'s\nrepresents,  in Puerto Rico.
