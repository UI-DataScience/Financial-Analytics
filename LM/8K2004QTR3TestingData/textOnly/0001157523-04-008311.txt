Based upon the valuation\n    results of its third party appraisal experts, the Company recorded\n    a pretax charge of approximately $24 million in the first quarter\n    of fiscal year 2003 as a result of implementing the fair value\n    model of the new accounting standard.\n\n\n    The Neiman Marcus Group, Inc. believes reporting adjusted earnings\nis a more accurate representation of the Company\'s on-going economic\nperformance and therefore uses adjusted earnings internally to\nevaluate and manage the Company\'s operations.
