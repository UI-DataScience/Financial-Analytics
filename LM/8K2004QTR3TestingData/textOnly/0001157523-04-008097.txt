ADE set a new Company record by generating $5.1 million\nin net income, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the first quarter of\nfiscal 2005. This is an increase of 56 percent from $3.2 million, or\n$0.23 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and 181\npercent from $1.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the\nyear-ago quarter. The net income figure for first-quarter fiscal 2004\nincluded approximately $400,000 in severance charges as well as a $1.7\nmillion gain on the sale of a portion of the Company\'s then 50 percent\nownership in Japan ADE, Ltd. (JAL).\n    "ADE performed admirably in the first quarter of fiscal 2005,\nachieving record earnings while significantly adding to our cash\nposition," said Dr. Chris L. Koliopoulos, ADE\'s president and chief\nexecutive officer. "In addition to our financial success, ADE made two\nsignificant new product announcements at Semicon West in July that\nutilize our core technologies, broaden our product portfolio and\naddress growing markets."\n    "By consistently meeting or exceeding its operational and\nfinancial goals, ADE has been able to take advantage of strategic\nopportunities to further strengthen its position in our core silicon\nwafer manufacturing market and in the growing area of semiconductor\nproduction process control. ADE will continue to leverage its broad\nintellectual property to drive further growth," Dr. Koliopoulos\nconcluded.\n    ADE\'s backlog increased 11 percent to $46.0 million on July 31,\n2004 from $41.5 million on April 30, 2004. Gross margin was 53 percent\nfor the first fiscal quarter, up from 51 percent for the fourth\nquarter of fiscal 2004 and up eight hundred basis points from 45\npercent for the first quarter a year ago. The increase in gross margin\nwas achieved through improvements in ADE\'s operational efficiencies\nand changes in its product and geographic sales mix.\n    ADE generated approximately $4.7 million in positive cash flow for\nthe first quarter of fiscal 2005. Cash and cash equivalents totaled\n$46.2 million at July 31, 2004. This compares with $41.6 million at\nthe end of fiscal 2004.\n    ADE Chief Financial Officer Brian James said, "ADE\'s financial\nperformance is now among the very best in our industry. We have been\nable to leverage a significant portion of our revenue growth directly\nto our bottom line while continuing to build a stronger balance sheet\nand deliver opportunistic new products. While bare wafer remains the\nlargest portion of our revenue stream today, we have been able to\nenter attractive new markets because of our multiple core\ntechnologies, and this strategy should provide us with new revenue\nstreams for years to come."\n\n    Looking Ahead\n\n    "We are proud of the financial success that ADE achieved to open\nfiscal 2005, and we believe that we can post even stronger results in\nthe second quarter," added Dr. Koliopoulos. "While the latest industry\nforecasts have been mixed, our near-term visibility remains good. Even\nif the pause in capital equipment spending that some have predicted\nshould occur, we are confident in ADE\'s technology leadership as well\nas its market position, and we are encouraged that the industry will\nremain committed to increasing 300mm capacity and this will be a year\nof growth for ADE."\n    For the second quarter of fiscal 2005, ADE anticipates that\nrevenues will continue to rise sequentially, increasing in the range\nof two to eight percent. The Company expects to achieve gross margins\nin the range of 51 percent to 53 percent for this period. Based on\nthese factors, ADE expects to report another quarter of record\nearnings, with net income ranging from $0.35 to $0.40 per diluted\nshare for the second quarter of fiscal 2005. This net income guidance\nassumes 14.4 million weighted average shares outstanding for the\nperiod ending October 31, 2004.\n\n    Conference Call Reminder\n\n    ADE will host a conference call and webcast on August 25, 2004 at\n8:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) to discuss these financial\nresults.
