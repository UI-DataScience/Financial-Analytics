The operating results for the quarter were\nat the high end of Company guidance.\n    Sales for the quarter were $80,434,000, up from $70,333,000 in the\nthird quarter, with net income of $8,896,000, or $0.14 per share. Net\nincome for the third fiscal quarter was $4,306,000, or $0.07 per\nshare. Sales were $33,654,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year\n2003 and net loss was $(81,531,000), or $(1.61) per share. New orders\nfor the fourth quarter were $66 million, down 15% from the prior\nquarter and up 64% from the fourth quarter last fiscal year. There\nwere no customer cancellations during the quarter.\n    For the twelve-month period ended July 31, 2004, sales were\n$255,801,000 compared to $119,449,000 in the preceding fiscal year.\nNet income was $1,961,000, or $0.03 per share. For the prior fiscal\nyear, net loss was $(145,068,000), or $(2.92) per share.\n    Roger W. Blethen, chairman and chief executive officer of LTX\ncommented, "We met our financial and operating targets for the quarter\nincluding generating higher revenues and higher net income. While\noverall orders were lower than anticipated, we saw a much broader mix\nof customers contributing to the total, including five different\ncompanies that each represented greater than 10% of orders during the\nquarter."\n    Mr. Blethen continued, "During the fiscal year, we achieved\nseveral strategic objectives: we moved to volume production on two\nsecond-generation Fusion systems, gained share in the subcontract test\nmarket, demonstrated the operating leverage of our business model and\nstrengthened our balance sheet.\n    As we enter fiscal year 2005, LTX believes it is entering a period\nwhere the current growth cycle has stalled for the industry. Although\nwe cannot predict the magnitude and duration of this pullback, we\nbelieve our business model allows us maximum flexibility to respond to\nchanging conditions, whichever direction the business cycle follows."\n\n    First Quarter 2005 Outlook\n\n    For the quarter ending October 31, 2004, revenue is expected to be\nin the range of $54 million to $57 million, with gross margin at\napproximately 38%. The loss per share is projected to be in the range\nof $(0.07) to $(0.10) assuming 61.1 million average shares\noutstanding. This guidance does not include any provisions for unusual\ncharges.\n    The Company will conduct a conference call today, August 26, 2004,\nat 4:30 PM EDT to discuss this release.
