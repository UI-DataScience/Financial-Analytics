Reports First Fiscal Quarter 2005 Results\n\n    ELK GROVE VILLAGE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 9, 2004--SigmaTron\nInternational, Inc. (Nasdaq:SGMA) today reported revenues and earnings\nfor the quarter ended July 31, 2004. Revenues were $25,078,167\nresulting in a 1% increase from the prior year first quarter revenues\nof $24,833,796. Net profit decreased 18% for the first quarter of\nfiscal 2005 to $1,036,969 compared to $1,269,979 for fiscal 2004.\nFully diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2005\nwere $ 0.27 compared to $0.37 in the prior year.\n    Gary R. Fairhead, SigmaTron\'s President and Chief Executive\nOfficer, commented: "We are pleased to report a profitable first\nquarter for fiscal 2005. While our profits are down from the first\nquarter of fiscal 2004, which was a record for the first quarter, our\nresults in the short term will be negatively impacted by our\ninvestment in China. If you add to that planned expense the escalating\ninsurance costs and regulatory costs imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley, we\nbelieve we have held our own reasonably well.\n    "During the quarter our production continued to slowly ramp up in\nChina. As we go thru fiscal 2005 we expect the revenue to continue to\ngrow, which should put China in a positive operating position later in\nfiscal 2005. The reaction to our China operation from customers and\npotential customers has been favorable to date.\n    "During the first quarter our Las Vegas operation was slow, which\nis not atypical for the gaming market at this time of the year. We\nbelieve that the gaming market will continue to prosper in the long\nterm and expect our operation in Las Vegas to benefit.\n    "Our Mexican operation continues to be busy. We have also seen\nrenewed interest in Mexico as opposed to China which we believe will\nhelp us long term. Elk Grove Village remains busy as well and is\nlooking at several new niche markets as new opportunities. As we have\nalready announced, during the second quarter we acquired the balance\nof our affiliate, SMT Unlimited L.P. We believe this acquisition will\nbetter position us with customers and investors.\n    "We will be launching our first significant advertising campaign\nin September, which is exciting. We are working with several new\ncustomers that we believe will help us grow during calendar 2005. We\nremain optimistic about the future and our opportunities and as\nalways, appreciate the support we receive from our stockholders,\ncustomers, banks, vendors and employees."\n\n    Headquartered in Elk Grove Village, IL, SigmaTron International,\nInc. is an electronic manufacturing services company that provides\ncomponents, printed circuit board assemblies and turnkey (completely\nassembled) electronic products.
