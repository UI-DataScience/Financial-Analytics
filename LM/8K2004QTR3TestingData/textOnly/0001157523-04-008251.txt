Cremin, Esterline CEO said that he continues to be\nencouraged by steady improvements in commercial aerospace markets.\n"Increases in the world airlines\' scheduled available seat miles,\ndepartures, and flight hours are having a positive impact on our\nbusiness," Cremin said.\n    Esterline\'s defense business also remains solid. Revenue activity\nin the company\'s combustibles and countermeasure operations was\nparticularly strong; however, Cremin advised that the product mix was\nskewed toward lower margin components.\n    Cremin further indicated that expenses and production\ninefficiencies associated with acquisition integration activity also\nimpacted the quarter.  He noted that, "...in connection with a\nprevious acquisition, we closed two plants in our Avionics & Controls\nsegment during the quarter, and moved the operations into a single new\nfacility. The new plant will enhance operating efficiencies going\nforward, but due to zoning and other similar regulatory issues, the\nmove took longer and proved more disruptive than first anticipated."\n    Responding to the practicality of offsetting these third quarter\nevents by fiscal year end, Cremin said the company is reducing its\nfull-year guidance to the range of $1.40 to $1.50 from its previous\nguidance of $1.50 to $1.60. Cremin emphasized, though, that\nfundamentally nothing has changed. "These kinds of timing issues have\ntheir way of smoothing themselves out in a few quarters," he said.\n"Our solid backlog and order book are good indicators that longer term\nwe remain firmly on track. Orders received in the third quarter\ntotaled $151.9 million compared with $147.4 million a year ago.\nYear-to-date orders are up 5% to $463.7 million from $441.5 million a\nyear ago. Backlog at July 30, 2004, was $331.1 million compared with\n$321.2 million at the end of the prior year period, and $329.9 million\nat the end of last quarter.\n    Year-to-date income from continuing operations was $18.1 million,\nor $.84 per diluted share, on sales of $433.4 million. The results\ninclude a previously reported first quarter $1.9 million tax benefit\nand a $2.9 million after-tax severance expense. For the first nine\nmonths of fiscal 2003, income from continuing operations was $20.3\nmillion, or $.97 per share, including the previously noted $.09 per\nshare foreign currency gain, on sales of $402.1 million.\n    The company also reported $0.6 million in net income, or $.03 per\ndiluted share, in the third quarter from a discontinued operation, W.\nA. Whitney. In July 2002, Esterline discontinued its Automation\nsegment to focus on its core aerospace/defense business. On Tuesday,\nAugust 31, Esterline signed a definitive agreement for the sale of the\nWhitney operation. An after-tax gain of approximately $6 million is\nexpected to be recorded in the fourth quarter.\n    Including discontinued operations, the company reported net\nearnings in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 of $7.6 million, or $.36\nper diluted share, compared with $8.4 million, or $.40 per diluted\nshare, in the prior year period. Year-to-date net earnings were $19.4\nmillion, or $.90 per diluted share, compared with $14.5 million, or\n$.69 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. The year-ago period\nincluded a loss from discontinued operations of $5.8 million, or\n($.28) per diluted share and the previously noted foreign currency\ngain.\n    Subsequent to the quarter close, Esterline finalized the\nacquisition of Leach Holding Corporation for approximately $145\nmillion in cash. Leach is a leading producer of high-performance\nelectromechanical relays, solid-state switching devices and advanced\npower distribution assemblies primarily for aerospace applications.\nThe transaction brings more than 1,000 new employees to Esterline and\nis expected to add nearly $120 million to Esterline\'s current\nannualized revenue base of $600 million. Cremin noted that,\n"...following a reasonable period of integration, the Leach business\nis expected to contribute significant positive results."\n\n    This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within\nthe meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese forward-looking statements are based on the current intent and\nexpectations of the management of Esterline, are not guarantees of\nfuture performance, and involve risks and uncertainties that are\ndifficult to predict. Esterline\'s actual results and the timing and\noutcome of events may differ materially from those expressed in or\nimplied by the forward-looking statements due to changes in\naerospace/defense
