LOUIS, MISSOURI, SEPTEMBER 15, 2004 -- Falcon Products, Inc.\n(NYSE: FCP), a leading manufacturer of commercial furniture, today announced\nnet sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 of $58.4 million, compared\nwith $62.3 million for the third quarter ended August 2, 2003.\n\n         Excluding restructuring charges and other one time charges, the\nCompany\'s results would have been a net loss of $5.1 million or $0.52 per\nshare in the third quarter of 2004, compared with a net loss of $0.8\nmillion, or $0.08 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2003, due to\nlower volumes year-to-year and increased interest cost. The charges in the\nthird quarter of 2004 included a $9.5 million loss on early extinguishment\nof debt ($6.5 million relates to the non cash expense of the fair value of\nthe warrants issued per the June 15, 2004 senior credit facility waiver) and\na $4.9 million restructuring charge related to the closure of manufacturing\nfacilities.
