Included in the EBITDA loss for the\n            quarter ended June 30, 2004 is approximately $448,000 of non-cash\n            expenses and charges.\n\n      o     Net Loss: Net loss was approximately $1,207,000, or $.26 per share,\n            for the third quarter ended June 30, 2004, an increase of 62%\n            compared to approximately $743,000, or $.30 per share for the\n            comparable quarter in the prior year.\n\n      o     Gross Margin: Gross margin decreased slightly to 64% for the third\n            quarter ended June 30, 2004, down from 65% for the comparable\n            quarter in the prior year.\n\nThird Quarter Ended June 30, 2004 Financial Results Summary\n\nFor the third quarter ended June 30, 2004, revenue increased 13% to $2,141,405\nfrom $1,896,740 for the third quarter ended June 30, 2003. The Company incurred\na net loss of $1,207,252, or $.26 per share, for the third quarter ended June\n30, 2004, compared to a net loss of $742,554, or $.30 per share during the third\nquarter ended June 30, 2003.\n\nThe Company incurred an EBITDA loss during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 of\napproximately $687,000, compared to EBITDA of approximately $53,000 during the\ncomparable quarter in the prior year. The increased EBITDA loss during the\nrecently ended third quarter was primarily attributed to an increase in\nprofessional fees and other expense. Professional fees include non-cash expenses\nresulting from the issuance of shares of stock, options and warrants of\napproximately $227,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, compared to\napproximately $95,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2003. Other expense,\nexcluding interest expense or income increased approximately $518,000. Included\nin Other Income and Expense are non-cash costs including settlements of\nobligations, allocation of losses from Onstream Media, inventory reserves and\nwrite-offs and gains or losses on the disposal of fixed assets. The total\nnon-cash costs included in other expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 was\napproximately $222,000.\n\n                                     99.1-1\n\n', u'\n\n"The increase in revenue during the recently ended third quarter as compared to\nthe third quarter of fiscal 2003 and the preceding first two quarters of fiscal\n2004 was due to sales of the Company\'s new digital asset management services,"\nsaid Randy Selman, president and Chief Executive Officer of Visual Data. "This\nnew service, which was deployed during the second quarter of fiscal 2004\nfollowing the Company\'s purchase of processing and distribution software and\nother assets from Virage, Inc., contributed approximately $417,000 to our total\nrevenues for the quarter ending June 30, 2004. This increase was partially\noffset by reduced revenues from our Webcasting Group as a result of a decrease\nin total events, most notably in the lower-priced, audio-only segment. We have\nbeen able to significantly offset this erosion in event production by focusing\non building sales in the higher per-event priced product segment that\ncapitalizes on our proprietary feature set, including slides, chat, polling and\nstreaming video solutions, as opposed to the lower-priced audio-only segment.\nLooking ahead, we expect the growth of our higher end service offering, coupled\nwith future growth in our digital asset management services, will enable us to\ngrow our revenue base in coming quarters."\n\nAbout Visual Data Corporation\n\nVisual Data Corporation (http://www.vdat.com) is a business services provider,\nspecializing in meeting the webcasting and digital asset management needs of\ncorporations, government agencies and a wide range of organizations, as well as\nproviding audio and video transport and collaboration services for the\nentertainment, advertising and public relations industries.
