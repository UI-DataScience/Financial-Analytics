(Nasdaq:ESIO) today announced results for\nits fiscal 2005 first quarter ended August 28, 2004.\n    First quarter sales were $72.6 million, down 11% compared to\nfourth quarter sales of $81.8 million and up 248% compared to prior\nyear first quarter sales of $20.9 million. Operating income for the\nquarter was $15.4 million, compared with operating income of $16.8\nmillion in the fourth quarter and an operating loss of $15.5 million\nin the first quarter a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $10.6\nmillion, or $0.38 per basic share and $0.36 per diluted share,\ncompared with net income of $16.2 million, or $0.57 per basic share\nand $0.54 per diluted share in the fourth quarter and a net loss of\n$9.4 million, or $0.34 per basic and diluted share in the first\nquarter a year ago.\n    Net orders for the first quarter were $67.6 million, a decrease of\n35% compared with $104.7 million in the fourth quarter and an increase\nof 58% compared with $42.7 million in the first quarter of 2004.\nBacklog decreased to $68.2 million at August 28, 2004 compared to\n$78.5 million at May 29, 2004. Deferred revenue increased this quarter\nto $17.2 million compared to $12.0 million at May 29, 2004.\n    "Overall, the company executed well in a challenging environment,"\nnoted Nick Konidaris, ESI\'s president and chief executive officer.\n"Despite a decrease in demand, we were able to achieve our target\noperating model of 50% gross margins, 30% operating expense, and 20%\noperating income. A few customers have delayed orders; however\nindustry utilization rates remain high and orders are not being\ncancelled. We believe the current decrease in industry demand will\nfacilitate an inventory rationalization."\n    Konidaris continued, "The sequential order rate decreased in each\nof our three businesses, indicative of the broad-based cautiousness in\nthe industry. We continued to meet our delivery requirements as\nshipments remained strong, increasing 1% over the fourth quarter.\nDespite the increase in shipments, revenues were down 11% sequentially\nas our deferred revenue balance increased during the quarter."\n    Mike Dodson, ESI\'s chief financial officer added, "Gross margins\nof 51% during the quarter were down from 53% in the fourth quarter.\nFourth quarter margins benefited 3% from the sale of inventory that\nhad been previously reserved. Excluding this benefit, first quarter\nmargins were up 1% from the fourth quarter, representing the sixth\nconsecutive quarter of margin improvement. Operating expenses were $21\nmillion in the quarter, down from $27 million in the fourth quarter.\nExcluding the $4 million settlement for the class action lawsuit\ncharged in the fourth quarter, operating expenses were down $2 million\nfrom the fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower\nvariable selling expenses related to the decrease in revenues as well\nas lower research and development due to the timing of project\nexpenses."\n    "Our balance sheet remains strong. Cash and investments were $337\nmillion at the end of the quarter, up $4 million from the fourth\nquarter. The increase was primarily due to our strong operating\nperformance," concluded Dodson.\n    Konidaris added, "There is very little visibility in the current\nenvironment. However, we believe demand will decrease for at least\nanother quarter. As a result, we expect order volume in the second\nquarter to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million. Consistent\nwith the decrease in the order forecast, we believe second quarter\nshipments and revenues will be in the range of $60 million to $70\nmillion. We plan to manage our margins and operating expenses in\naccordance with our target operating model."\n    The company will hold a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern\nTime. The session will include a review of the financial results,\noperational performance, business outlook, and a question and answer\nperiod.\n    The conference call can be accessed by calling 800-374-2470\n(domestic participants) or 706-634-5108 (international participants).\nA live audio webcast can be accessed at www.esi.com.
