Net sales were\na record $424.1 million in the quarter, up 71% over a year ago, and included net\nsales of $106.5 from the Company's recent acquisitions of MACSTEEL Monroe and\nTruSeal Technologies. Demand at the Vehicular Products and Building Products\nsegments was robust throughout the quarter, and backlogs remain healthy for the\nremainder of the fiscal year. Operating income was a record $35.3 million, and\nincome from continuing operations was $21.0 million, up 40% compared to last\nyear's third quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were\n$1.26, up 37% from a year ago. ", u'\n', u'Third quarter 2004 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of\n$1.26 include the operating results from Monroe and TruSeal of approximately\n$0.34 per share and a LIFO charge of $0.19 per share. Third quarter 2003 diluted\nearnings per share from continuing operations of $0.92 include an executive life\ninsurance benefit of $0.13 per share and a LIFO charge of $0.02 per share.\nExcluding the financial impact of the acquisitions, the LIFO charges and the\nlife insurance benefit, results are up 36% for the third quarter 2004 over the\nthird quarter 2003. ', u'\n', u'Net sales for the third quarter 2003 were $247.4 million. Income from\ncontinuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations\nfor the third quarter 2003 were $15.0 million and $0.92, respectively. ', u'\n', u'Highlights ', u'\n', u'Raymond A. Jean, chairman and chief executive officer stated, "We delivered\nto our investors back-to-back record quarterly operating income resulting from:\n(1) robust customer demand, (2) new customer programs, (3) improved margins, (4)\naccretive acquisitions, and (5) ongoing company-wide lean initiatives. North\nAmerican light vehicle builds in our third quarter were in line with the\nyear-ago period. Heavy duty truck builds remain very strong compared to last\nyear, with builds up this quarter some 40% over this time last year. Housing\nstarts and remodeling activity remained at high levels through the quarter as\nwell," Jean said. ', u'\n', u'"We announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.17 to $0.19\nper share, which equates to a $0.76 per share dividend on an annualized basis.\nThe Board also authorized the Company to reload its stock buyback program,\nincreasing the existing authorization up to one million shares. These actions\nare consistent with our excellent financial results and our prospects for the\nfuture. Quanex historically generates very strong cash flow, and for fiscal\n2004, we anticipate operating cash flow to be in the $100 million to $115\nmillion range at this time. Looking out the next few years, we believe we can\nmanage our business to generate robust cash that will enable us to continue to\nfund the growth of our core businesses while rewarding our long-term\nshareholders. Our last dividend increase occurred in the second quarter of\n2003," said Jean. ', u'\n', u'"Excellent progress continued with the integration of MACSTEEL Monroe and\nTruSeal Technologies. Both facilities continue to exceed our operating and\nfinancial expectations. On an annualized basis, we believe the two acquisitions\nwill now generate diluted earnings per share this year of $0.75 to $0.85, after\ninterest expense, up an additional $0.15 per share from our previous estimate,"\ncontinued Jean. ', u'\n', u'Quanex uses the LIFO method of accounting to enhance its cash flow, which\nrequires the Company to revalue inventories year to year. Raw material costs,\nparticularly steel scrap, are up substantially from the end of last year, which\nnegatively impacts ongoing inventory valuations based on the LIFO method. For\nthe third quarter, the Company booked a $5.0 million pre-tax, non-cash LIFO\ncharge.

Customer demand at our engineered\nsteel products business remained strong, and our operations ran at very high\nutilization rates. Automotive OEMs trimmed light vehicle inventory days about\n13% in July from June, to 64 days. This appears to be holding OEM build\nschedules to slightly below this time last year, and with our new programs, our\nbacklog will remain strong throughout the fourth quarter," continued Jean. ', u'\n', u'"Engineered steel bar shipments were up 92% in the quarter versus the\nyear-ago quarter, and up 17% when you set aside shipments from our recently\nacquired Monroe facility. Operating income increased due to excellent demand and\nimproved margins, the result of a higher scrap surcharge. Average raw material\ncosts were about even with the second quarter," Jean said.

Key market drivers are\nresidential building and remodeling markets. ', u'\n', u'"Our engineered products business experienced very strong sales throughout\nthe quarter," Jean said. "Demand for our window and door components remained\nhigh as housing starts and remodeling activity generally remained brisk.\nCustomer demand is expected to again be strong in our fourth quarter." ', u'\n', u'"Our aluminum sheet business had an excellent quarter as both sales and\noperating income were up from last quarter and the year-ago quarter as well.\nShipments were strong to our building and construction customers. Further\nbenefiting the aluminum sheet business this year has been the gradual\nimprovement in demand from our capital equipment, service center, and\ntransportation customers. The business experienced higher prices that more than\noffset increases in material costs, and improved credit terms with many of its\ncustomers," said Jean. ', u'\n', u'Outlook ', u'\n', u"Customer demand in the Company's two target markets, vehicular products and\nbuilding products, is expected to remain strong through the remainder of the\nfiscal year, supported by an improving economy and strong market drivers. ", u'\n', u"Vehicular Products - 2004 North American light vehicle builds are expected to\nbe essentially in line with last year's production. Heavy truck builds for 2004\ncould end the calendar year up 50% over 2003 builds of 175,000, while demand in\nthe capital equipment, farm/construction and seamless tubing industry is\nexpected to continue to improve. ", u'\n', u"The business model for our engineered steel products business is built\nprimarily on supplying customers with engineered alloy and carbon steel bar\nproducts whose prices are based on annual contracts, with quarterly surcharge\nadjustments for raw material costs. In a period of escalating raw material\ncosts, as has been experienced over the last 12 months, earnings are reduced by\nthe inherent three (3) month lag in the surcharge adjustment. For instance, in\nthe July/August time period, the business experienced raw material cost\nincreases of some $90 per ton over June. These higher costs will be recovered,\nbut not until the new surcharge adjustment takes effect on October 1. In a\nperiod of declining scrap costs, earnings are enhanced. To appreciate the\nbusiness' normalized earnings power, financial results that reach beyond\nquarterly timeframes will need to be considered. ", u'\n', u"Building Products - Market drivers should remain positive through the\nremainder of the Company's fiscal year, resulting in excellent order activity.\nHousing starts for 2004 are expected to be very close to last year's record 1.85\nmillion units, while remodeling expenditures, which the Company believes account\nfor about one half of the segment's sales, are also expected to remain at\nhealthy levels. The engineered products business will continue to deliver\nexcellent operating results. At the aluminum sheet business, the Company expects\ncontinued strong sales and rising income, driven by robust customer demand and a\nmuch improved aluminum sheet supply/demand balance. ", u'\n', u"Quanex's earnings outlook for the fourth quarter remains favorable when\ncompared to year-ago results. But the volatility of steel scrap costs and its\ninfluence on the valuation of LIFO inventories at year-end make the fourth\nquarter earnings outlook difficult to predict. Notwithstanding the above, the\nCompany's original, annual 2004 diluted earnings per share guidance from\ncontinuing operations of $3.25 to $3.75 remains appropriate. ", u'\n', u'Other ', u'\n', u'The Company continues to account for stock options using the current\ntransition provisions of SFAS No. 123. Accordingly, Quanex does not reflect the\noption expense in its income statement or diluted earnings per share. However,\nthe Company does disclose the impact on net income and diluted earnings per\nshare in the footnotes to its SEC financial statements. Expensing stock options\nin the third quarter would have reduced net income by about $525,000 after-tax,\nor $.03 on a diluted earnings per share basis. ', u'\n', u"On March 31, 2004, Quanex announced its plans for restructuring Piper Impact\nand called for the sale of the business. The Company stated that while Piper\nImpact continued to generate positive cash flow, its market focus is no longer\naligned with Quanex's strategic direction of serving the vehicular products and\nbuilding products markets. As part of the restructuring effort, Piper's third\nquarter operating results have been reclassified as discontinued operations.\nQuanex has a letter of intent to sell the business, and is currently working\nwith the buyer on a definitive agreement. At this point in the process, Quanex\nexpects proceeds from the sale of Piper to be below the division's net book\nvalue, and accordingly, recorded a $3.1 million after-tax write-off in\ndiscontinued operations for the third quarter. ", u'\n', u'On July 1, 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) of the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board (FASB) made a preliminary proposal that would require\nall issuing companies of contingent convertible debentures to show the full,\ndilutive impact of these debentures on their financial statements. Based on the\nEITF proposal currently under review, this could mean an additional 2.2 million\nshares of earnings dilution to Quanex and have an annualized earnings per share\nimpact of approximately $0.30 - $0.35 per common share. However, the Company\ndoes have the option to settle its convertible obligation with either common\nstock, cash or a combination of the two. If the Company chooses to settle its\nentire convertible obligation with cash, it would not be required to show the\ndilutive impact of the higher share count in the calculation of its earnings per\nshare. ', u'\n', u'Cash Dividend Raised & Declared ', u'\n', u'The Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend approximately 12%,\nor $0.02 per share, which equates to an annualized increase of $0.08 per share.\nThe quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 is payable to shareholders of record on\nSeptember 15, 2004, and is payable September 30, 2004.
