(NYSE: RPM) announced\ntoday that sales for its fiscal 2005 first quarter, ended August 31, 2004, will\nbe approximately 13-14 percent higher than same-period sales a year ago.\n\n"More than 80 percent of this sales increase represents internal growth," said\nFrank C. Sullivan, president and CEO, "with both operating segments producing\ndouble-digit gains. The momentum in our industrial businesses, which began\nduring the second half of fiscal 2004, continued through this first quarter. Our\nconsumer segment continues to generate solid results comparable to the levels we\nhave seen the past couple of years."\n\nFirst-quarter earnings and earnings per share are expected to increase\n13-15 percent over the previous year\'s first-quarter results.\n\nThe company further indicated that while pricing initiatives are being phased\nin, higher material costs remain a challenge. In addition, RPM estimates that\nits quarterly asbestos costs, the details of which will be set forth in the\ncompany\'s report on Form 10-Q, will amount to approximately $19 million.\nOverall, these quarterly costs and claims activity remain in line with the\ncompany\'s expectations, and are consistent with the assumptions underlying its\nreserve.\n\nRPM\'s anticipated results will also reflect the early adoption of FAS 123\n("Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation") and a reclassification of co-op\nadvertising expenses to be more in conformity with industry practice. The\nadoption of FAS 123 is expected to impact first-quarter earnings by\napproximately one-half cent per share. The reclassification will not impact\nearnings results, but will reduce reported net sales and SG&A expenses by the\nsame amount, estimated to be 1-1.5 percent of sales for fiscal 2005. Prior\nperiods will also be reclassified for comparability purposes.\n\n"We are very pleased with these initial results for our first quarter, which\nfall well in line with our full-year fiscal 2005 guidance for high-single-digit\ngrowth in revenue and 10-12 percent growth in earnings," Sullivan added. "We\nwill be presenting our complete first-quarter results the morning of October 6,\nwhen we will be issuing our earnings release followed by our conference call."\n\nRPM International Inc., a holding company, owns subsidiaries that are world\nleaders in specialty coatings and sealants serving both industrial and consumer\nmarkets.
