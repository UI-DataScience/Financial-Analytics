(NASDAQ: LCGI) today\nannounced operating results for the 16 weeks (first quarter 2005) ended July 23,\n2004. Improved comparable center revenue (centers opened 18 months or longer)\nand operating results were the highlights for the quarter.\n\nNet revenue for first quarter 2005 increased $4.2 million, or 6.8%, from the\nsame period last year to $66.5 million. Learning Center revenue increased $3.7\nmillion. Increased revenue was achieved through a combination of increased\ntuition rates and enrollments. Childtime Learning Centers revenue increased $2.0\nmillion, with comparable Childtime center revenue increasing 5.0%. Tutor Time\nLearning Centers revenue increased $1.7 million, with comparable Tutor Time\ncenter revenue increasing 6.8%. Franchise Operations revenue, increased $0.5\nmillion, or 25.5%, from the same period last year to $2.3 million.\n\nThe increase in Franchise Operations revenue is a result of royalties generated\nfrom revenue increases experienced by the Company's franchisees and franchise\nfees. Tutor Time franchisee-owned centers reported revenue of $40.2 million for\nthe quarter, an increase of 11.4% from the same period last year, with\ncomparable center revenue increasing 8.7% for the quarter. First quarter 2005\nsystemwide sales, which includes revenue from franchisee-owned and company-owned\ncenters, grew to $104.0 million, an increase of 8.1% from the same period last\nyear.\n\nGross profit for first quarter 2005 increased $1.4 million, or 17.4%, from the\nsame period last year to $9.4 million. This increase consisted of a $0.9 million\nincrease in Learning Center gross profit and a $0.5 million increase in\nFranchise Operations gross profit. The increase in Learning Center gross profit\nwas primarily a result of revenue increases and decreases in personnel expenses\nas a percentage of net revenue resulting from improved labor efficiencies. The\nincrease in Franchise Operations gross profit was the result of increased\nrevenue.\n\nOperating income for first quarter 2005 increased $1.3 million from the same\nperiod last year to $1.9 million. The improvement was primarily attributable to\nincreased gross profit ($1.4 million), and a gain on the sale of assets ($0.5\nmillion) offset by increased general and administrative expenses ($0.6 million)\nand an increase in depreciation and amortization ($0.1 million).\n\n\n\n", u'\n\n\n\n\nNet income improved to $1.0 million for first quarter 2005, compared to a net\nloss of ($0.3 million) for the same period last year. The improvement was\nprimarily attributable to increased operating income of $1.3 million.\n\nFirst quarter 2005 net income per share was $0.05 on a basic and diluted basis\nas compared to a net loss of ($0.02) on a basic and diluted basis for the same\nperiod last year. On May 16, 2003, the Company completed a rights offering under\nwhich it issued 14.1 million shares of common stock. Accordingly, the weighted\naverage shares outstanding were 19.8 million and 13.3 million for the 16 weeks\nended July 23, 2004 and July 18, 2003, respectively.\n\nBill Davis, President and Chief Executive Officer commented, "During all of\nfiscal 2004, we reported quarterly year over year improvements in operating\nresults, which were achieved primarily as a result of cost reductions. While we\ncontinue to achieve cost reductions, we have increased our focus on revenue\ngrowth, and this quarter our initiatives have resulted in strong comparable\ncenter revenue gains. Comparable center revenue for the quarter increased 5.0%\nfor our Childtime centers and 6.8% for our Tutor Time centers, which compare to\nless than 2.0% for fiscal 2003 and 2004. We are excited about the continued\noperating improvements and the second consecutive quarter of positive net\nincome. We expect to see a continuation of strong comparable center revenue and\nimprovements in year over year operating results."\n\n                     SELECTED INCOME STATEMENT DATA\n                 ($ IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)\n\n', u'\n', u'\n\n                                              16 WEEKS ENDED\n================================================================================\n                                   JULY 23, 2004        JULY 18, 2003\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n', u' ', u' ', u'\n\n         Revenue, net             $       66,525      $       62,296\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n         Gross profit             $        9,402      $        8,011\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Operating income           $        1,911      $          640\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Net income (loss)          $          957      $         (270)\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Basic and diluted net            $         0.05      $        (0.02)\n     income (loss)\n       per share\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n', u'\n', u'\n\n\n\n                           SELECTED BALANCE SHEET DATA\n                                 (IN THOUSANDS)\n\n', u'\n', u'\n================================================================================\n                                JULY 23, 2004     APRIL 2, 2004\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n', u' ', u' ', u"\n    Total Current Assets           $18,025           $16,191\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n        Total Assets               $87,775           $85,619\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Total Current Liabilities        $33,697           $28,133\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      Total Liabilities            $49,782           $48,613\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Shareholders' Equity           $37,993           $37,006\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n", u"\n\n\nABOUT LEARNING CARE GROUP, INC.\n\nLearning Care Group, Inc. is the parent company of Tutor Time Child\nCare/Learning Centers and Childtime Learning Centers.
