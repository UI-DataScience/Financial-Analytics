(Amex: OPT)\nannounced today that it has completed its previously announced review of its\nclassification of long term debt in its previously reported financial statements\nfor the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003 and its previously announced\nreview of its accounting for inventory during the quarter ended March 31, 2004\nand has restated its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002\nand 2003 and for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. The company also filed its\nForm 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2004.\n\nIn connection with the restatement of its 2002 and 2003 financial statements,\nthe company reclassified approximately $9.7 million and approximately $1.6\nmillion owed under its loan agreement with its senior lender as of December 31,\n2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively, from a long term liability to a\ncurrent liability. The restated financial statements reported current portions\nof long-term debt of approximately $10.8 million and approximately $2.8 million\nas of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively, and long term debt\nof approximately $1.8 million and approximately $1.0 million as of December 31,\n2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. The company concluded that the amounts\noutstanding pursuant to certain provisions contained in the credit facility\nshould have been classified as current liabilities rather than long-term debt,\npursuant to the provisions of consensus 95-22 issued by the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board's Emerging Issues Task Force. There was no change in the net\nincome or loss available to common stockholders as originally reported for such\nperiods as a result of this restatement.\n\nIn connection with the restatement of its first quarter 2004 financial\nstatements, the company determined that at March 31, 2004 its inventory was\noverstated by approximately $0.7 million and an inventory liability was\nunderstated by approximately $0.3 million. The effect of these changes resulted\nin an approximate $0.2 million reduction to revenue and an approximate $0.8\nmillion increase to cost of goods sold, which resulted in a net income reduction\nof approximately\n\n", u'\n\n$1.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2004. As a result, the restated\nfinancial statements reported a net loss to common stockholders for the quarter\nended March 31, 2004 of approximately $1.1 million opposed to approximately $0.2\nmillion as originally reported and net loss per common share for the quarter\nended March 31, 2004 of $0.04 opposed to $0.01 as originally reported. The\ncompany concluded that the overstatement of inventory resulted primarily from\nmathematical errors in the calculation of inventory.\n\nThe company also announced today that it reported total net revenues for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2004 of approximately $60.3 million, down from\napproximately $63.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003 and total net\nrevenues for the three months ended June 30, 2004 of approximately $30.8\nmillion, down from approximately $32.0 million for the three months ended June\n30, 2003. The company also reported loss from continuing operations for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2004 of approximately $1.0 million, down from\napproximately $2.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003; loss from\ncontinuing operations for the three months ended June 30, 2004 of approximately\n$0.1 million, down from approximately $2.2 million for the three months ended\nJune 30, 2003; net loss to common stockholders for the six months ended June 30,\n2004 of approximately $2.3 million, which is equal to the net loss to common\nstockholders of approximately $2.3 million for the six months ended June 30,\n2003; and net loss to common stockholders for the three months ended June 30,\n2004 of approximately $1.1 million, down from approximately $2.3 million for the\nthree months ended June 30, 2003.\n\nAdditionally, the company stated that on August 27, 2004, the company amended\nthe terms of its loan agreement with its senior lender to remove the condition\nprecedent that there is no material adverse effect or material adverse change\nwith respect to the company from the lender\'s obligation to advance funds to the\ncompany and to remove the occurrence of a material adverse effect or material\nadverse change with respect to the company from the definition of events of\ndefault under the loan agreement. In connection with this amendment, the\ncompany\'s major stockholder, Palisade Concentrated Equity Partnership, L.P.,\nguaranteed an additional $1,000,000 of the company\'s obligations under the loan\nagreement.\n\nABOUT OPTICARE HEALTH SYSTEMS, INC.\n\nOptiCare Health Systems, Inc. is an integrated eye care services company focused\non vision benefits management, the distribution of products and software\nservices to eye care professionals, and consumer vision services, including\nmedical, surgical and optometric services and optical retail.\n\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements made pursuant to the\nsafe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese statements include, but are not limited to, statements containing words\nsuch as "plan," "anticipate," "expect," "intend," "believe," "will," or similar\nexpressions.
