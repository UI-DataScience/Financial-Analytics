"Total Company second quarter revenues were up 20 percent on\ntop of last year\'s  second  quarter 24 percent  gain;  catalog/direct  marketing\nsales (which  includes TV  infomercial  and wholesale  sales) were up 28 percent\nover last year\'s 11 percent sales  increase;  Internet  sales were up 14 percent\nover a huge 47 percent  increase  during last year\'s second  quarter," noted Mr.\nThalheimer.  "Retail  sales were  affected by less than  anticipated  television\ninfomercial media availability and higher media rates, producing generally lower\nsales,  particularly  during the  second-half of July\'s  election-related  media\nspending.  Gross  margin  was  also  adversely  impacted  by  approximately  one\npercentage  point by a small sales  channel shift this quarter from retail sales\nto wholesale sales," Mr. Thalheimer stated.\n\n         "In the second  quarter we opened ten new  stores,  increasing  the new\nstores opened fiscal  year-to-date to 15. We expect to achieve our goal of 15 to\n20 percent new store unit growth,  with a plan to open 26 new stores during this\n\n', u'\n\nfiscal year. We plan to continue with our goal of new store openings of 15 to 20\npercent unit growth for the next fiscal year," Mr.  Thalheimer  further  stated.\n"We continue to have good new product  introductions and we are confident of the\nstrength of our multichannel sales strategy.\n\n         "Our  guidance  for the  third  quarter  is a net loss in the  range of\n$(0.08) to $(0.11) per  diluted  share.  This  compares  with last year\'s  third\nquarter earnings of $0.06 per diluted share.  This guidance is based on lowering\nsales for the third quarter  relating to softer than expected sales in the first\nhalf of August. With the current guidance,  it is also prudent to lower our full\nyear earnings per share guidance to $1.65 to $1.69 per diluted share, a decrease\nfrom our previous full year guidance of $1.83 to $1.87 per diluted  share.  This\ncompares to last  year\'s  $1.65 per diluted  share," Mr.  Thalheimer  concluded.\n\nConference Call for Second Quarter\'s Earnings\n\n         On August 19, 2004,  interested parties are invited to listen to a live\nconference  call  discussing  second  quarter  results and the outlook for third\nquarter  and  fiscal  year 2004 at 1:30 PM  Pacific,  4:30 PM Eastern  time,  at\nwww.sharperimage.com,  or call  888-211-8104.
