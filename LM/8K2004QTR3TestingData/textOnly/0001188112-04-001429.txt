REPORTS FISCAL YEAR 2004\nAND FOURTH QUARTER SALES AND NET INCOME\n\nREADING, PA, September 29, 2004 - Arrow International, Inc. reported today net\nsales of $433.1 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2004, an increase\nof 13.9%, or $52.7 million, versus its prior fiscal year. Net income for the\nyear was $55.9 million compared to $45.7 million in fiscal year 2003, an\nincrease of 22.3%. Adjusting for certain special items, as described below, net\nincome was $60.2 million compared to $51.9 million in the prior fiscal year\nperiod, an increase of 16.0%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.26 compared to\n$1.04 in fiscal year 2003 ($1.36 compared to $1.19 diluted earnings per share in\nthe prior fiscal year period when adjusted for special items).\n\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 increased 10.9% to $112.9\nmillion compared to net sales of $101.8 million in the same prior year period.\nNet income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was $14.4 million compared to\n$7.9 million in fiscal year 2003 and diluted earnings per share were $0.32\ncompared to $0.18 in fiscal year 2003.

Anderson, Jr., stated that "the Company made\nprogress in fiscal 2004 with significant overall growth in revenue and profit.\nThe fiscal year 2004 core growth rate of our base business, adjusted for\nfavorable exchange rates and for the fiscal year 2004 incremental sales from the\nacquisitions of Diatek(TM), NEOCARE(R) and the Company\'s Florida distributor\ncorresponding to the periods in fiscal year 2003 prior to these acquisitions,\nwas about +8 1/2% versus the prior year. Based upon management\'s assessment of\nglobal market growth of approximately 5%, this represents an improvement in\nmarket share. We believe this growth is traceable to several key factors,\nincluding (1) an increased focus on our cornerstone central venous catheter\nbusiness, (2) continued progress with sales of procedure kits featuring the\nCompany\'s safety devices and ARROWg+ard(R) upgrades, (3) new products, such as\nthe Cannon(TM) II chronic dialysis catheter, the StimuCath(R) regional block,\nand the NEOCARE(R) line of neonatal catheters, (4) improvements in the\nCompany\'s sales and marketing strategies, (5) our move to direct selling in\nFlorida, and (6) improvements in operational processes."\n\nSUMMARY OF COMPARATIVE RESULTS ADJUSTED FOR SPECIAL ITEMS:\n\nResults of Total Company Operations, excluding: (1) the charges for\nLionHeart(TM) inventory and equipment write-offs in the third quarter of fiscal\nyear 2004, and research, development and engineering expense incurred in the\nthird and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2004 for second generation\nLionHeart(TM) components, and restructuring charges related to consolidation of\ncertain manufacturing facilities incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year\n2004; and (2) the special charge, the charge to research, development and\nengineering expense, and the interest income and tax credit related to amended\nfederal tax returns in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003\n\n\n                                        5\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n\n(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)           Fourth Quarter                   Fiscal Year\n                                                  --------------                   -----------\n                                              FY04        FY03        % GROWTH        FY04      FY03        %GROWTH\n', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u'\nNet sales                                    $112.9      $101.8        10.9%        $433.1     $380.4        13.9%\n\nIncome before tax, excluding interest         $22.9       $21.1         8.5%         $89.2      $77.1        15.7%\nincome/charges\n\nNet income, excluding interest                $15.4       $14.2         8.5%         $60.2      $51.9        16.0%\nincome/charges\n\nDiluted earnings per share, excluding         $0.35       $0.33         6.1%         $1.36      $1.19        14.3%\ninterest income/charges\n', u"\n\nAttached to this release is reconciliation to Generally Accepted Accounting\nPrinciples, or GAAP, that presents the components of the items excluded in\ndetermining the income before tax, net income and diluted earnings per share\namounts in the above table. The following three paragraphs discuss the excluded\nitems.\n\n        1) As discussed in the third quarter of fiscal year 2004, the Company's\n        previously announced decision on April 15, 2004 to delay commencement of\n        the Phase II U.S. clinical trials of the Arrow LionHeart(TM), the\n        Company's fully implantable Left Ventricular Assist System (LVAS),\n        resulted in the Company incurring charges totaling $3.7 million, or\n        $0.06 diluted earnings per share, in the third fiscal quarter. The\n        charges consisted primarily of an inventory write-off of $3.1 million,\n        or $0.05 diluted earnings per share, for certain LionHeart(TM)\n        components that became obsolete with the Company's decision not to\n        proceed with the clinical trials using the first generation\n        LionHeart(TM) power system and controller. The other charge was for\n        equipment write-off of $0.6 million, or $0.01 per diluted earnings per\n        share. In addition, in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year\n        2004, the Company incurred research, development and engineering expense\n        of $1.1 million and $1.3 million or $0.01 and $0.02 diluted earnings per\n        share, respectively, for completion of the second generation\n        LionHeart(TM) power system and controller. The Company's remaining\n        investment in the LionHeart(TM) includes $1.8 million of components and\n        open purchase commitments usable with either the first or second\n        generation electronics and $2.4 million in manufacturing equipment.\n\n        2) In August, 2004 the Company initiated the consolidation of its\n        operations at its Winston-Salem and San Antonio facilities into existing\n        manufacturing facilities. These steps are part of the overall\n        manufacturing realignment and capacity increases announced in June 2004.\n        The transitional work on the consolidation has begun and is expected to\n        continue into the spring of 2005. In connection with this restructuring,\n        the Company has accrued severance payments of $208,000, or $0.01 per\n        diluted earnings per share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 in\n        accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 112.\n\n        3) As reported last year, the Company incurred two charges in its fourth\n        quarter of fiscal year 2003 totaling $11.6 million, or $0.17 diluted\n        earnings per share. The first was a special charge to establish a\n        reserve of $8.0 million or $0.12 diluted earnings per share for a\n        settlement in two related patent infringement lawsuits, which, as\n        previously disclosed, related to certain of the Company's hemodialysis\n        catheter products. The second charge was the write-off to research,\n        development and engineering expense of $3.6 million or $0.05 diluted\n        earnings per share, related to development costs for the second\n        generation of external batteries used in the LionHeart(TM). The\n        Company's interest income in the fourth fiscal quarter ended August 31,\n        2003 benefited from interest income of $1.4 million, or $0.02 diluted\n        earnings per share, accruing on refunds related to amended federal tax\n        returns. The fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003 also benefited from a\n        $500,000 tax credit related to federal tax returns that claimed\n        additional research and development tax credits.\n\nSUMMARY OF FISCAL YEAR 2004 SALES RESULTS:\n\nTotal Company U.S. sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 increased 11.2% to\n$72.3 million and represented 64.0% of total net sales. Total Company U.S. sales\nin the twelve months ended August 31, 2004 increased 12.0% to $279.9 million and\nrepresented 64.6% of total net sales.\n\n\n                                        6\n", u'\n\nTotal Company international sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 increased\n10.3% to $40.6 million from $36.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003\nand represented 36.0% of total net sales. The weakness of the U.S. dollar in the\nquarter, compared to the same period of last year, increased total Company\ninternational sales by $ 1.9 million, or 5.2%. Total Company international sales\nin the twelve months ended August 31, 2004 increased 17.4% to $153.2 million\nfrom $130.5 million in the same prior year period and represented 35.4% of total\nnet sales. Currency exchange rate changes discussed above, increased total\nCompany international sales by $10.7 million, or 8.2% versus year ago.\n\nAUTOCAT(R) 2 WAVE(TM) - The Company identified several areas where the product\ncould be improved during the period when we were addressing the previously\nreported issues. Those improvements have been made and are now being tested.\nThese modifications will enhance the ease of use of the AutoCAT(R) 2WAVE(TM),\nwhich the Company believes will provide a significant advantage over competing\ntechnologies.\n\nWorldwide sales of critical care product platforms and cardiac care products for\nthe fourth quarter and twelve months ended August 31, 2004 are shown in the\ntable below.\n\n', u'\n', u'\n\n                                                 FOURTH QUARTER                            TWELVE MONTHS\nSALES BY PRODUCT PLATFORMS                       --------------                            -------------\n(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)                        FY04      FY03     % GROWTH             FY04      FY03       % GROWTH\n\n', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u'\n    Central Venous Catheters*               $57.8     $50.7        14.0%           $222.7    $186.4          19.5%\n    Specialty Catheters                      35.2      32.3         9.0%            135.1     124.1           8.9%\n    Stepic distributed products               2.8       3.3       (15.2)%            12.0      13.0          (7.7)%\n                                            -----     -----                        ------    ------\n      Subtotal Critical Care                 95.8      86.3        11.0%            369.8     323.5          14.3%\n    Cardiac Care                             17.1      15.5        10.3%             63.3      56.9          11.2%\n                                            -----     -----                        ------    ------\n\n    TOTAL                                  $112.9    $101.8        10.9%           $433.1    $380.4          13.9%\n', u'\n\n*Includes Diatek(TM) product sales in the second, third and fourth fiscal\nquarters of both years and NEOCARE(R) product sales in the third and fourth\nfiscal quarters of both years.\n\nDEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS:\n\nAs previously reported, Arrow expects to submit dossiers for the second\ngeneration LionHeart(TM) power system and controller to the Company\'s European\nNotified Body, TUV Product Services of Munich, Germany by the end of calendar\nyear 2004 and anticipates receiving an approval for use of these electronics in\nthe device approximately three months later, given that many of its components\nhave not changed, no additional clinical data is required and the LionHeart(TM)\nquality system has already been certified. Arrow\'s European marketing plan for\nthe LionHeart(TM) is based upon the receipt of this approval and the CE-marking\nof the second generation electronics.\n\nAs previously reported, the Company has made significant progress in its efforts\nto develop and test modifications to its CorAide(TM) continuous flow ventricular\nassist device to resolve elevated levels of hemolysis experienced in the first\nimplant of the device. The Company expects that European clinical trials of the\nCorAide(TM) device should resume later this calendar year although, due to the\npioneering nature of this program, it is difficult to predict precise timing.\n\nINTERNATIONAL BUSINESS TRANSACTION:\n\nThe Company also announced the purchase of certain assets of one of its\ndistributors in Italy, AB Medica S.p.A. (ABM) for a total purchase price of up\nto approximately $8.0 million to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal\nyear 2005 with various installments thereafter on account of ongoing tender\ncontract sales. ABM had been one of Arrow\'s distributors in Italy since 1982.\nThe agreement includes the purchase of distributorship rights, customer lists,\nas well as the inventory and specified tender contracts associated with the sale\nby ABM of Arrow products. Arrow will begin selling directly in Italy through its\nsubsidiary, Arrow Italy S.p.A. Mr. Anderson commented that "Arrow has had a\nproductive partnership with ABM for many years. However, the move to a direct\nselling model should enable us to more effectively develop our business in the\nlarge Italian market."\n\nFISCAL YEAR 2005 TARGETS:\n\nMr. Anderson stated "fiscal year 2004 was a year of beginnings. In fiscal year\n2005, we intend to focus our efforts on ensuring that our marketing and\noperational processes meet the requirements of our customers, the demands of a\nhighly competitive marketplace, and the changes needed to sustain a growing\nbusiness. As we look to the new fiscal year, our objective is to accelerate the\nCompany\'s core growth rate through an increased rate of new product\nintroductions, continued improvements in our marketing and sales execution, and\ninfrastructure investments to improve operational effectiveness."\n\n\n                                        7\n', u"\n\nThe Company's sales and earnings targets along with some of the key assumptions\nunderlying these targets for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2005, are\nshown in the table below.

Although the Company\nbelieves that the expectations in such forward-looking statements are\nreasonable, the Company can give no assurance that such expectations will prove\nto have been correct. The forward-looking statements are based upon a number of\nassumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity and\nconsidered reasonable by the Company, are inherently subject to significant\nbusiness, economic and competitive risks, uncertainties and contingencies which\nare beyond the control of the Company, and upon assumptions with respect to\nfuture business decisions which are subject to change. Accordingly, the\nforward-looking statements are only an estimate, and actual results will vary\nfrom the forward-looking statements, and these variations may be material.\nConsequently, the inclusion of the forward-looking statements should not be\nregarded as a representation by the Company of results that actually will be\nachieved. Forward-looking statements are necessarily speculative in nature, and\nit is usually the case that one or more of the assumptions in the\nforward-looking statements do not materialize. Investors are cautioned not to\nplace undue reliance on the forward-looking statements. In connection with the\n"Safe Harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of\n1995, the Company cautions the reader that, among others, the factors below,\nwhich are discussed in the Company\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended August 31, 2003 and in its other filings with the Securities and\nExchange Commission, could cause the Company\'s results to differ materially from\nthose stated in the forward-looking statements. These factors include: (i)\nstringent regulation of the Company\'s products by the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration and, in some jurisdictions, by state, local and foreign\ngovernmental authorities; (ii) the highly competitive market for medical devices\nand the rapid pace of product development and technological change in this\nmarket; (iii) pressures imposed by the health care industry to reduce the cost\nor usage of medical products and services; (iv) dependence on patents and\nproprietary rights to protect the Company\'s trade secrets and technology, and\nthe need for litigation to enforce or defend these rights; (v) risks associated\nwith the Company\'s international operations; (vi) potential product liability\nrisks inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices;\n(vii) risks associated with the Company\'s use of derivative financial\ninstruments; and (viii) dependence on the continued service of key members of\nthe Company\'s management.\n\n\n                                       9\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n\n                                                 ARROW INTERNATIONAL, INC.\n                                                   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n                                RECONCILIATION TO GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n                                                      AUGUST 31, 2004\n\n\n                                                               QUARTER ENDED 8/31/04\n                                                                                 SECOND\n                                                 INVENTORY     EQUIPMENT     GENERATION\n                              AS  REPORTED       WRITE-OFF     WRITE-OFF          R,D&E    RESTRUCTURING      AS ADJUSTED\n', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u'\nGross Profit                        59,917               -
