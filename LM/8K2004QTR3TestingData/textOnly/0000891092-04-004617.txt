The quarter is expected to include 11 cents from a gain\non land development and three cents of re-engineering costs.  Excluding these\nitems, diluted earnings per share is expected to be 8 - 10 cents compared with\nbreakeven last year.\n\n    The 16 - 18 cents in the third quarter would be 10 - 11 cents higher than\nthe outlook given in July.  A major component of the improvement is\n5 - 6 cents of higher earnings from the Company\'s segments, mainly Europe and\nAsia Pacific.  Additionally, lower than foreseen third quarter re-engineering\ncosts, interest expense and income taxes contribute to the improvement, along\nwith a slightly higher gain on land development.\n\n    Third quarter 2004 sales are expected to be up slightly versus the 2003\nquarter, although down slightly excluding the favorable impact of foreign\nexchange on the comparison.\n\n    Today, the Company announced a headcount reduction in its Tupperware U.S.\nbusiness and will record a re-engineering charge in the fourth quarter of\napproximately $1.0 million for cash severance costs.  The resulting\nstreamlined organization will be appropriate under the Company\'s new sales\nforce compensation plan and to align its cost structure with the current sales\nlevel.  Annualized savings from these actions are expected to be approximately\n$2.7 million.  This is incremental to previously announced value chain\nimprovements.\n\n    After considering anticipated third quarter results and its current\nbusiness trends and plans, the Company is confirming its previous full-year\noutlook range of $1.28 - $1.38 per diluted share.  The Company expects to\nnarrow this range upon reporting third quarter results on October 18, 2004.\nThis outlook reflects the continuation of good results in BeautiControl North\nAmerica, Latin America and many Asia Pacific markets.  It also reflects\ncontinued weakness in the United States and Japan and lower productivity\nevidenced through fewer parties in Germany during its Fall promotional period.\nIncluded in this outlook is 13 cents of gains on land development, which have\nalready been realized through the third quarter, and six cents of re-\nengineering costs.\n\n    The Company expects an insurance recovery associated with hurricane damage\nat its Orlando headquarters.  The amount to be recovered is expected to be\nagreed upon by year-end 2004 and reflected in fourth quarter results; however,\nno estimate is included in the outlook range.\n\n    "We have taken these actions in our U.S. business as part of an ongoing\neffort to improve our value chain while we rebuild the sales force through\nimplementation of the Taste of Tupperware Party and our new sales force\ncompensation plan," said Rick Goings, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n"We are pleased with our results this quarter and to be able to confirm our\nfull-year guidance range."\n\n    Tupperware will announce its third quarter earnings on October 18, 2004\nand a conference call will be held at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time.
