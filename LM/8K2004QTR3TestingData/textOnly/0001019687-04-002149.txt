ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.\n\n         On September 22, 2004, American Pallet Leasing, Inc., an Iowa\ncorporation ("APL"), completed the initial closing of a reverse acquisition of\nthe Registrant pursuant to which the Registrant will acquire all of the\noutstanding common shares of APL in exchange for a controlling interest in the\nRegistrant (the "Reorganization").\n\n         Pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement and Plan of Reorganization\n("Purchase Agreement"), the Registrant shall issue a total of 5,758,091 shares\nof the Registrant\'s common stock in exchange for all APL common shares, or\napproximately one (1) common share of the Registrant share for every 2.2 APL\nshares. The Company issued the shares pursuant to Rule 506 under the Securities\nAct of 1933. Prior to the initial closing, Tim Bumgarner, the Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer of APL, purchased 4,299,500 outstanding restricted common\nshares of the Registrant held by certain affiliates of the Registrant, including\nthe Registrant\'s officers, directors and 10% shareholders. At the same time, Mr.\nBumgarner cancelled 9,458,900 of his common shares of APL, so that after giving\neffect to the Reorganization and Mr. Bumgarner\'s private purchase, Mr.\nBumgarner\'s percentage interest in the Registrant\'s common shares held by all\nAPL shareholders is the same as his percentage interest in APL prior to the\nReorganization.\n\n         The Purchase Agreement also provided that Michael Morrison and Jesse\nSackman would resign as the sole officers and directors effective as of the\ninitial closing and be replaced by Tim Bumgarner, Jim Crigler and Robert Vinson\nas the directors of the Registrant. In addition, the following individuals were\nappointed to serve as officers of the Registrant:\n\n            NAME OF OFFICER                   POSITION\n            ---------------                   --------\n\n        Tim Bumgarner               Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive\n                                    Officer, and President\n\n        Byron Hudson                Chief Financial Officer\n\n\n         APL is a vertically integrated manufacturer and logistical supplier of\npallets. APL is engaged in an acquisition roll up of strategically located wood\npallet manufacturers and saw (lumber) mills. APL\'s goal is to create a "Closed\nLoop Distribution System" by transforming the $1.6 billion per year pallet\nbusiness from a commodity industry into a logistics management enterprise that\nwill supply and manage the pallet requirements of manufacturers and\ndistributors. APL currently owns one saw mill and intends to acquire other saw\nmills as a means of sourcing cheap lumber for APL\'s wood pallet manufacturing\noperations. APL also holds patents on proprietary galvanized steel patents and\nintends to commence the manufacture of its patented steel pallets subject to the\nreceipt of additional capital. APL intends to enter into management and\nlogistics contracts with manufacturers and distributors pursuant to which APL\nwill supply and manage all of the customers pallet needs. APL is in negotiations\nto procure its initial management and logistics contracts. All revenue of APL to\ndate has been derived from the manufacture and sale of wood pallets.\n\n\n\n', u'\n\n         In August 2004, APL acquired its initial operating entity, G&G/Cherokee\nWood, Inc. ("G&G/Cherokee"), a saw mill in Blacksburg, South Carolina. APL\nacquired all of the common shares of G&G/Cherokee in consideration of $550,000\nand an unsecured promissory note in the original principal amount of $2.75\nmillion, for a total purchase price of $3.3 million. For the year ended December\n31, 2003, APL and G&G/Cherokee had pro forma combined revenues of $5,500,884 and\nnet income of $127,726. For the seven months ended July 31, 2004, APL and\nG&G/Cherokee had pro forma combined revenues of $3,121,586 and a net loss of\n$247,050. On a pro forma combined basis, as of July 31, 2004, APL and\nG&G/Cherokee had total assets of $7,218,417, working capital of $136,857 and\ntotal stockholders\' equity of $3,449,417. These figures are unaudited and\ntherefore subject to year-end audit adjustments.\n\nITEM 2.01. COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.\n\n         See Item 1.01 above.\n\nITEM 2.02. REQUEST OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\n\n         On September 22, 2004, the Registrant issued a press release that\nincluded, among other things, information concerning the results of operations\nand financial condition of APL.

("APL"),\na vertically integrated manufacturer and logistical supplier of pallets, today\nannounced it has completed the initial closing of its reverse acquisition of\nLiterary Playpen, Inc. (OTCBB: LYPP), pursuant to which Literary Playpen will\nacquire all of the outstanding common shares of APL in exchange for a\ncontrolling interest in Literary Playpen. Through the reverse acquisition, APL\nwill become a publicly-traded company.\n\nPursuant to a securities purchase agreement, Literary Playpen will issue shares\nof its common stock to the shareholders of APL in exchange for the APL\nshareholders\' transfer of their APL common shares. After giving effect to the\nreverse acquisition, Literary Playpen will have approximately 11,437,090 shares\noutstanding.\n\nIn conjunction with the closing, existing APL directors Tim Bumgarner, Jim\nCrigler and Robert Vinson have been elected to the Literary Playpen Board of\nDirectors, replacing Jesse Sackman and Michael Morrison, who have resigned as\nthe directors of Literary Playpen.
