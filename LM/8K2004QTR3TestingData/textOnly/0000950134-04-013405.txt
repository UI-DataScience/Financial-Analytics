(Nasdaq:\nCOSN - News), a provider of managed, network-based IP and Broadband Services\nDelivery Platforms, today announced that after an extensive evaluation of\nstrategic alternatives, the Company has initiated actions to lay-off most of its\nemployees in September 2004, retaining a limited team of employees to provide\ncustomer support and handle matters related to the ongoing exploration of\nstrategic alternatives. Management and the Board of Directors concluded that\nmaintaining the Company's existing employee headcount was not necessary for any\nof the strategic alternatives currently under consideration and the ongoing\nemployee-related expenditures could potentially decrease total stockholder\nvalue.\n\nThere can be no assurance that any transaction or other corporate action will\nresult from the company's exploration of strategic alternatives. Further, there\ncan be no assurance concerning the type, form, structure, nature, results,\ntiming or terms and conditions of any such potential action, even if such an\naction does result from this exploration. CoSine does not intend to make any\nadditional comments regarding such exploration unless and until developments\nwarrant further disclosure.\n\nABOUT COSINE COMMUNICATIONS\nCoSine Communications is a global telecommunications equipment supplier founded\nin 1998 to empower service providers to deliver a compelling portfolio of\nmanaged, network-based IP and Broadband services to consumers and business\ncustomers.
