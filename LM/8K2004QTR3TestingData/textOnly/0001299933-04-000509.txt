The live webcast and the replay can be accessed at www.efi.com.\n\n\n', u'About our Pro Forma Net Income and Adjustments', u'\n', u'\nTo supplement our consolidated financial results prepared under generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (\x93GAAP\x94), we use a pro forma measure of net income that is GAAP net income adjusted to\nexclude certain costs, expenses and gains. Our pro forma net income gives an indication of our\nbaseline performance before gains, losses or other charges that are considered by management to be\noutside of our core operating results. In addition, pro forma net income is among the primary\nindicators management uses as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. These measures\nare not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP and may be materially different from pro\nforma measures used by other companies. We compute pro forma net income by adjusting GAAP net\nincome with the impact of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and other non-recurring\ncharges and gains. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered in\nisolation or as a substitute for net income prepared in', u' accordance with GAAP. ', u'In the\nthird and fourth quarter of 2004, the expected amortization of acquisition related intangibles, net\nof tax benefit, would lead to a $0.04 to $0.05 per share reduction from the pro forma earnings per\nshare amount.', u'\n', u'Safe Harbor for Forward Looking Statements', u'\n', u'\nThe statements: \x94 EFI currently expects third quarter revenues in the range of $97\xa0million to $100\nmillion and pro forma net income per diluted share, which excludes the impact of amortization of\nacquisition-related intangibles and other non-recurring charges and gains, of $0.12 to $0.14.
