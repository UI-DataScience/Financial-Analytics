The fourth\nquarter net loss was ($1.6 million) for fiscal year 2004 compared to a\nfourth quarter net loss of $2.3 million in fiscal year 2003. The fourth\nquarter per share loss was ($0.27) compared to a loss of ($0.36) in the\nprior year.\n\nFor fiscal year 2004, revenues were $95.5 million compared to fiscal year\n2003 revenues of $82.8 million, a 15% improvement. Loss from operations was\n($5.5 million) in fiscal 2004 compared to a loss of ($12.5 million) in\nfiscal 2003. Net loss for fiscal 2004 was ($8.2 million) compared to a loss\nof ($19.5 million) in fiscal 2003. The per share loss was ($1.31) versus a\nper share loss of ($3.09) for the prior year.\n\nPeter Murphy, president and CEO stated "Revenue grew 25% sequentially in\nthe fourth quarter and we made significant progress towards profitability.\nIncluded in the fourth quarter operating loss were reserves of\napproximately $.5 million against inventory and accounts receivable,\nrelated to a customer dispute. Many other results indicate we are doing the\nright things to strengthen our financial performance and market position.\nOur book-to-bill ratio remains positive with a backlog of approximately $29\nmillion.\n\nAsian operations recorded the major share of growth both in the fourth\nquarter and for the fiscal year. Year over year growth in China exceeded\n50% and Asia now represents 38% of revenues. In the fourth quarter, our\nproprietary low temperature lead free surface mount assembly technology was\ntransferred to China to take advantage of the growing opportunities for\nadding value to our circuits.\n\nOur Polymer Thick Film business in the United States and Europe experienced\ndouble digit growth and solid profitability in 2004. In addition to\ncontinued strong performance in the appliance market, significant new\nbusiness relationships were established in the medical market. The medical\nmarket now represents over 17% of worldwide revenues with important\nopportunities across all product lines.\n\n\n', u'\n\n\nLaminated cable sales remained strong throughout the year, an indication of\nour improved North American electronics market. Increased capabilities in\nour Mexican operation enhanced profitability. The Multilayer Business\nsustained significant losses primarily due to underutilization of the\nMethuen manufacturing center. In July, we announced a strategic\nrelationship with Delphi Corporation in which Parlex would supply\nmultilayer product to the connection systems business line. The Company\nbegan transfer of product from Delphi into this operation late in the\nquarter. This additional business will improve utilization in the\nMultilayer operations over the next several quarters.\n\nBookings for the quarter and fiscal year 2004 were approximately $30 and\n$103 million, respectively. Significant bookings were recorded in the\ncomputer segment for inkjet printer products, in the appliance sector for\ndishwasher electronics, in the medical sector for disposable medical\nproducts and in handheld electronics for cell phone antennas.\n\nThe Company expects continued growth in fiscal year 2005 with a return to\nprofitability. We are carefully managing costs while we continue to\nintroduce new products to meet the needs of our broad customer base."\n\nInterested parties are invited to participate in Parlex\'s quarterly\nteleconference, which will be held on Tuesday, August 31, 2004 at 10:00 AM\nEastern Time.
