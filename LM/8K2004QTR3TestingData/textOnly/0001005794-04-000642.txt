("Cracker\nBarrel"), a wholly owned subsidiary of CBRL Group, Inc. (the "Company"), reached\nagreement in principle to settle  certain  litigation  pending  against  Cracker\nBarrel.  Final settlement  documentation  has been negotiated and upon receiving\nappropriate  signatures,  which is expected to occur  within the next few weeks,\ndismissals with prejudice will be entered in the litigation in question.\n\n     The  litigation  being  resolved  by the  announced  settlements  has  been\npreviously  described in the Company\'s  reports filed with the  Commission.  See\nPart II, Item 1 of the Company\'s  Quarterly  Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter\nended April 30, 2004 filed with the  Commission on June 2, 2004.  The litigation\nbeing resolved consists of:\n\n    (1)       Serena McDermott and Jennifer Gentry v. Cracker Barrel Old Country\n              Store,  Inc.,  4:99-CV-0001-HLM  (United States District Court for\n              the Northern  District of Georgia  ("NDG")),  a collective  action\n              under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act involving approximately\n              10,000 opt-in plaintiffs ("McDermott");\n    (2)       Kelvis  Rhodes,  Maria Stokes et al. v.

Cracker  Barrel  Old  Country  Store,   Inc.,\n              4:01-CV-325-HLM  (NDG),  an  action  under  Title II of the  Civil\n              Rights  Act of 1964 and  Section  1981 of the Civil  Rights Act of\n              1866 involving 40 individual plaintiffs  ("Thomas"),  and of these\n              40 individual plaintiffs, 2 have elected not to participate in the\n              settlement; and\n    (5)       actions similar to Thomas brought by 62 individual  plaintiffs in\n              Arkansas,  North Carolina and Mississippi.\n\n', u"\n\n     Cracker Barrel has agreed to make payments totaling $8.7 million, including\nall attorneys' fees, in complete  settlement of the above described  litigation.\nOf that amount,  $3.5 million pre-tax was previously accrued in fiscal 2001 when\nCracker Barrel made offers of judgment in the McDermott case.\n\n     As previously  reported,  Cracker  Barrel entered into a consent order with\nthe U.S. Department of Justice resolving allegations similar to Thomas.  Cracker\nBarrel is currently  implementing  that consent  order.  Cracker  Barrel did not\nadmit any wrongdoing  and expressly  denied  wrongdoing.  Cracker Barrel reached\nagreement in order to avoid  expensive and  protracted  litigation.  The Company\nviews the  settlements as prudent  actions that are in the best interests of the\nCompany, its employees, its shareholders, and its guests.\n\n     These  settlements  will  result  in an after tax  charge to net  income of\napproximately  $3.3 million,  or  approximately  $0.07 per diluted share, in the\nfourth  quarter of the fiscal year ended July 30,  2004.  The total  incremental\ncost of these  settlements,  however,  is believed to be less than the potential\nexpense of continuing to litigate and bringing these cases to  conclusion.  This\ncharge was not  included  in the  Company's  previously  announced  guidance  of\nexpected diluted net income per share of $0.65-$0.68 for the fourth quarter. See\nExhibit 99 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission\non June 17, 2004,  which by this reference is  incorporated  herein as if copied\nverbatim. Likewise, this charge does not account for the possible effects of any\ninsurance recoveries that might be received.  The Company considers it premature\nto estimate what those amounts might be, if any.\n\n     See the press release issued by Cracker Barrel  furnished hereto as Exhibit\n99.2 and incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.\n\n\nItem 9.01.

The settlement is discussed more fully later in\nthis press  release  and in a Form 8-K filed with the  Securities  and  Exchange\nCommission today.  Before the effect of the settlement  charge, the results were\nin line with the  Company\'s  most  recent  guidance  for the fiscal  2004 fourth\nquarter of  between  $0.65-$0.68  per  share,  and down from $0.70 in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal 2003. The  settlement  charge had an effect of $0.07 and $0.06\nper  diluted  share on the  quarter  and full year,  respectively.  The  Company\nreported fiscal 2004 full-year diluted net income per share of $2.25,  including\nthe $0.06  settlement  charge,  compared with $2.09 in fiscal 2003. In addition,\nthe Company  reported  sales trends for August of fiscal 2005,  guidance for the\nfirst quarter and full year of fiscal 2005, and announced a change to the future\ntiming and content of its regular press releases for reporting financial results\nand earnings guidance during fiscal 2005.\n\n         Highlights of the fiscal 2004  fourth-quarter  and year-end results and\nfiscal 2005 sales trends include:\n\n     -     Reached  a  mediated  settlement  in  principle  on  long-outstanding\n           litigation  resulting  in a charge to diluted net income per share of\n           $0.07 for the fourth quarter and $0.06 for the full year.\n', u'\n\n     -     Diluted  net income per share for the full year of fiscal 2004 was up\n           7.7% (10.5% before the effect of the $0.06  settlement  charge),  and\n           net income  was up 6.3% (9.5%  before  the  settlement  charge)  from\n           fiscal 2003 on an 8.3% increase in total revenue.\n\n     -     Diluted  net income per share for the fourth  quarter of fiscal  2004\n           was down  14.3%  (4.3%  before  the  effect of the  $0.07  settlement\n           charge),  and net income was down 15.8% (6.4%  before the  settlement\n           charge) from the fourth  quarter of fiscal 2003 on a 4.7% increase in\n           total revenue.\n\n     -     Comparable  store restaurant sales for the fourth fiscal quarter were\n           down 0.6% for the Company\'s Cracker Barrel operations, and comparable\n           store retail sales at Cracker Barrel were down 3.1%.\n\n     -     Comparable  restaurant  sales for the fourth  fiscal  quarter were up\n           5.6% in the Company\'s Logan\'s Roadhouse(R) ("Logan\'s") restaurants.\n\n     -     Full-year  fiscal 2004 comparable  store restaurant sales for Cracker\n           Barrel were up 2.0% from fiscal 2003,  marking the fifth  consecutive\n           year of positive comparable store restaurant sales at Cracker Barrel,\n           and comparable  store retail sales for the full fiscal year increased\n           5.3%.\n\n     -     Full-year fiscal 2004 comparable restaurant sales for Logan\'s\n           increased 4.8%.\n\n     -     Operating  income margin for the full fiscal year decreased 0.1% as a\n           percent of revenue  compared with a year earlier,  but increased 0.1%\n           before the settlement charge.\n\n     -     Net cash  provided by operating  activities  for the full fiscal year\n           was  approximately  $200 million,  marking five consecutive  years in\n           which cash  provided by operating  activities  has exceeded cash used\n           for capital expenditures (purchase of property and equipment) and the\n           fourth consecutive year this excess was more than $50 million.\n\n     -     Comparable store restaurant sales for the four weeks ended August 27,\n           2004,  the first  month of fiscal  2005,  increased  1.8% in  Cracker\n           Barrel and 3.9% in Logan\'s.  Comparable store retail sales in Cracker\n           Barrel were down 1.6% in the  period.  (See  discussion  below on new\n           reporting being adopted in fiscal 2005).\n\nFourth-Quarter Fiscal 2004 Results\n\n     The Company also noted Cracker Barrel\'s  announcement that yesterday it had\nreached a settlement in principle of certain  previously  reported lawsuits that\nalleged  discrimination  in  employment  and  public  accommodation  as  well as\nviolations  of the Fair Labor  Standards  Act.  Under  terms of the  settlement,\nCracker Barrel will pay $8.7 million to various  parties in order to resolve the\nlitigation.  The Company  previously accrued $3.5 million before taxes in fiscal\n2001  related  to  certain  of the  cases,  resulting  in a net charge now being\nrecorded in its fourth  quarter of fiscal  2004 of  approximately  $3.3  million\nafter  taxes,  or $0.07 per diluted  share for the fourth  quarter and $0.06 per\ndiluted share for the full fiscal year.\n\n     Total revenue for the fourth  fiscal  quarter ended July 30, 2004 of $607.5\nmillion increased 4.7% from the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003.  Comparable store\nrestaurant sales for the fourth quarter for the Cracker Barrel concept decreased\n0.6%,  including a 1.9% higher average check, 1.7% of which reflected menu price\nincreases,  and 2.5% lower  guest  traffic.  Comparable  store  retail  sales at\nCracker Barrel  decreased 3.1% for the quarter.  Logan\'s  comparable  restaurant\nsales for the  quarter  were up 5.6% as  average  check  increased  4.6%,  which\n', u'\nincluded approximately 3.0% of menu price increases, and guest traffic increased\n1.0%. During the quarter,  the Company opened eight new Cracker Barrel units and\none new franchised Logan\'s location.\n\n     The Company  reported  net income for the fourth  quarter of fiscal 2004 of\n$29.9 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, down from net income of $35.5 million\nand diluted net income per share of $0.70 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.\nFourth  quarter fiscal 2004 net income and diluted net income per share included\nafter-tax  litigation  settlement  charges of $3.3 million and $0.07 per diluted\nshare,  respectively,  before which net income was $33.3 million and diluted net\nincome per share was $0.67. Before the settlement charges,  the reported diluted\nnet  income  per share  results  were in line  with the  Company\'s  most  recent\nguidance of diluted net income per share of  $0.65-$0.68  for the fourth quarter\nof fiscal 2004.\n\n     Operating  income for the fourth quarter declined 14.9% from the prior year\nand fell from 9.9% of total  revenue  for the fourth  quarter of fiscal  2003 to\n8.0% in the fourth  quarter of fiscal  2004.  The  decline in  operating  income\nmargin  reflected  litigation   settlement  charges  (included  in  general  and\nadministrative  expense),  higher cost of goods sold, including the effects of a\nmid-single  digit  percentage  increase in overall  commodity  costs, and higher\nlabor and other operating expenses, partly offset by lower bonus expenses.\n\n     Commenting on the  fourth-quarter  results,  CBRL Group, Inc. President and\nChief Executive  Officer Michael A. Woodhouse said, "We are pleased that Cracker\nBarrel has reached the  mediated  litigation  settlement.  Apart from the charge\nassociated with the settlement, we achieved our earnings guidance for the fourth\nquarter in an  environment  of  widely-reported  weakening  sales  trends in the\nindustry and significant ongoing commodity cost pressures. We were encouraged by\nimprovements in comparable  store restaurant sales trends at both Cracker Barrel\nand Logan\'s from the early part of the quarter,  as Cracker Barrel  recovered to\npositive to last year and Logan\'s was up approximately 6% in fiscal July.\n\n     "Despite  these  external  factors,  we  continue  to focus on  operational\nexecution in our  restaurants,  and we were very pleased to receive  recognition\nfrom consumers that we are delivering outstanding experiences for our guests. We\nwere very proud to mark the 35th  anniversary  of Cracker  Barrel by being named\n`Best  Family  Dining  Chain  in  America\'  for  the  14th  consecutive  year by\nRestaurants  and  Institutions  magazine.  Also, in J.D.  Power and  Associates\'\ninaugural  study of customer  satisfaction in the restaurant  industry,  Cracker\nBarrel  scored the  highest  among  family  dining  chains in  overall  customer\nsatisfaction  in its core market regions and the second highest in those regions\namong all family and casual dining chains."\n\nFull-Year Fiscal 2004 Results\n\n     For the full fiscal year ended July 30, 2004, the Company  reported revenue\nof $2.4 billion compared with $2.2 billion for fiscal 2003, an increase of 8.3%.\nComparable  store  restaurant  sales for Cracker Barrel were up 2.0% from a year\nago,  including a 1.7% increase in average check and 0.3% higher guest  traffic,\nwhile retail sales increased 5.3%. Fiscal 2004 marked the fifth consecutive full\nyear of positive  comparable store  restaurant sales at Cracker Barrel.  Logan\'s\ncomparable  restaurant  sales for fiscal 2004  increased  4.8% from fiscal 2003,\n\n', u'\n\nwith average check rising 1.7% and guest traffic  increasing  3.1%.  The Company\nopened 24 Cracker  Barrel units,  and 11  company-operated  and four  franchised\nLogan\'s restaurants during fiscal 2004.\n\n     Operating income for fiscal 2004 increased 6.4% from fiscal 2003, including\nthe  effect of the  settlement  charge,  but  operating  margin of 7.8% of total\nrevenue was 0.1% below  prior  year.  Before the  settlement  charge,  operating\nincome improved 9.3% from fiscal 2003, and operating income margin improved as a\npercent of total  revenue from 7.9% in fiscal 2003 to 8.0% in fiscal  2004.  Net\nincome  for the full year  increased  to $113.3  million,  or $2.25 per  diluted\nshare, from $106.5 million, or $2.09 per diluted share, for the full year fiscal\n2003, reflecting increases of 6.3% and 7.7%, respectively (before the settlement\ncharge the increases were 9.5% and 10.5%, respectively).\n\n     Net cash  provided by operating  activities  was $200.4  million for fiscal\n2004,   $55.8  million  more  than  the  Company\'s  $144.6  million  in  capital\nexpenditures  (purchase of property and equipment).  This marks five consecutive\nyears where net cash  provided by operating  activities  exceeded the  Company\'s\ncapital expenditure outlays and the fourth consecutive year this excess was more\nthan $50  million.  In fiscal  2004,  the  excess  net cash was used  toward the\nrepurchase  of 1.8  million  shares  of the  Company\'s  common  stock  for $69.2\nmillion.  Since  beginning its share  repurchase  activities in fiscal 1999, the\nCompany has repurchased 22.7 million shares for $593.7 million. The Company also\nincreased its dividend payments in fiscal 2004 by over $15 million.\n\n     No share  repurchases were made during the Company\'s fourth fiscal quarter.\nShortly  after  the  Company   announced  a  new  2-million   share   repurchase\nauthorization  during the quarter,  mediation activity in the pending litigation\n(settlement of which is being  announced by Cracker  Barrel today)  intensified.\nAccordingly,  the Company suspended share repurchases  during these discussions,\nwhich  at any time  during  their  course  could  have  resulted  in a  mediated\nsettlement.  Now that a final  settlement  has been  reached  in  principle  and\ndisclosed, the Company expects to resume its share repurchase activity.\n\n     Woodhouse commented on the full-year results, saying, "We are pleased that,\napart from the  effects of the  settlement  charge,  we  delivered  double-digit\ngrowth in diluted net income per share and an  improvement  in operating  income\nmargin during a year marked by extraordinarily  unfavorable factors in commodity\nmarkets.\n\n     "We  continue to expect to generate  strong cash flow well in excess of our\ncapital expenditure needs, and we have a clear strategy for managing our capital\nstructure and returning capital to our shareholders  through dividends and share\nrepurchases.  We  believe  that we  have  two  strong  brands  with  experienced\nleadership  teams in place who will  guide us to  achievement  of our  long-term\noperating and financial objectives."\n\nSales Trends\n\n     The  Company  urges  caution  in  considering  its  current  trends and the\nearnings guidance  disclosed in this press release.  The restaurant  industry is\nhighly competitive,  and trends and guidance are subject to numerous factors and\ninfluences, some of which are discussed in the cautionary language at the end of\nthis press release.  The Company  disclaims any  obligation to update  disclosed\n\n', u"\n\ninformation on trends or targets other than in its periodic  filings under Forms\n10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n     The  Company  announced  that it is changing  its  protocol  for  regularly\nreporting sales results and earnings  guidance.  The expected  calendar of dates\nfor the Company's  expected press releases  announcing  results is at the end of\nthis  release.  The primary  changes are that the Company  will begin  reporting\ncomparable store sales results for its fiscal monthly  periods,  instead of on a\nquarter-to-date  basis, and does not expect to provide updated earnings guidance\nwith every sales update.  The Company  believes that these changes will make the\ntiming of disclosure of its results more  consistent with that of many others in\nthe restaurant  industry and improve  comparability of sales results from update\nto  update.  The  Company  has  provided  a table  at the  end of  this  release\nreflecting  comparable  store sales for each period of fiscal 2004 under the new\nreporting protocol for comparison.\n\n     The Company  reported that Cracker  Barrel's  comparable  store  restaurant\nsales for  August  of  fiscal  2005 (the four  weeks  ending  August  27,  2004)\nincreased  1.8%,  including  an  increase  of 2.9% in  average  check,  of which\napproximately  1.7% reflected menu price increases.  This increase compares with\nthe comparable  store  restaurant sales increase of 1.5% in the August period of\nfiscal  2004.  Comparable  retail  sales for  Cracker  Barrel  in fiscal  August\ndecreased  1.6%  (compared  with an 8.5% increase in the August period of fiscal\n2004),  including  the  unfavorable  comparison  for the last day of the  fiscal\nperiod to a porch sale event over Labor Day weekend  last year. A porch sale was\nheld this year also over Labor Day weekend,  but the holiday fell one week later\nthis year.  Logan's  comparable  store  restaurant sales grew 3.9% in the August\nperiod  versus a year  ago  (compared  with  0.9% in  August  of  fiscal  2004),\nincluding 5.2% higher average check, of which 3.0% reflected higher menu prices.\nThe Company  indicated  that there were no apparent net material  sales  impacts\nfrom  either  adverse  weather  or the  Olympics  in  August,  although  certain\nindividual stores did lose sales during Hurricane Charley.\n\n     To aid in the  transition to the new reporting  protocol,  the Company also\nreported  quarter-to-date  sales  trends for the nearly  six-week  period of its\nfirst fiscal quarter in 2005.  This is the final reporting of sales trends under\nthe  previous  quarter-to-date   approach.   Quarter-to-date   comparable  store\nrestaurant sales at Cracker Barrel  increased  approximately 2% from prior year,\nincluding  approximately 3% higher average check, of which approximately  1.5-2%\nreflected menu price increases.  Comparable store retail sales at Cracker Barrel\ndecreased   approximately  1.5-2%   quarter-to-date.   Logan's   quarter-to-date\ncomparable restaurant sales increased  approximately 4.5%, including an increase\nof approximately 5% in average check, of which approximately 3% reflected higher\nmenu  prices and  approximately  0.2%  reflected  increased  alcohol  sales as a\npercent of total sales.  Quarter-to-date  sales trends  reflected  the effect of\nstore closings  caused by Hurricane  Frances  during the Labor Day weekend.  The\nCompany  estimates that  quarter-to-date  comparable store restaurant sales were\nreduced by approximately  0.5-1% at Cracker Barrel and  approximately  0-0.5% at\nLogan's as a result lost sales from  Hurricane  Frances.  Retail sales appear to\nhave been affected by a greater  amount,  approximately  1-1.5%,  because of the\nlost or reduced porch sale in many locations.\n\n", u'\n\n     Woodhouse  commented  on the  trends,  "We are  pleased  by the  sequential\nimprovements  in  Cracker  Barrel\'s   restaurant   sales  trends,   and  by  the\ncontinuation of Logan\'s solid sales performance.  These results represent a good\nstart for our fiscal year."\n\nFiscal 2005 Earnings Guidance\n\n     The  Company\'s  present  guidance  for diluted net income per share for the\nfirst  quarter of fiscal 2005,  which ends October 29, 2004, is for a percentage\nincrease up to the mid-single digits from $0.56 in the year-ago quarter on total\npercentage revenue growth in the high single digits.  Earnings guidance reflects\nmany assumptions,  many of which cannot be known,  including,  very importantly,\nsales  expectations.  The Company presently expects  comparable store restaurant\nsales for the full first quarter to be up  approximately  1-3% at Cracker Barrel\nand up  approximately  4-5% at Logan\'s,  with  comparable  store retail sales at\nCracker  Barrel  expected to be flat to up  approximately  2% compared  with the\nyear-ago quarter. The Company presently expects operating income margins for the\nquarter to be down slightly from prior year, primarily reflecting that fact that\nthe Company has not yet lapped the  significant  commodity  cost  increases that\nbegan in the second  quarter of the prior  fiscal  year.  The Company  presently\nexpects to open five new Cracker Barrel units in the first quarter, of which one\nhas already opened, and seven new Logan\'s company-operated units, of which three\nhave already opened.\n\n     For  the  full-year  of  fiscal  2005,  the  Company  presently  expects  a\npercentage  increase in diluted net income per share in the mid-teens from $2.31\n(excluding  the  effects of the  settlement  charge)  for  fiscal  2004 on total\nrevenue of approximately $2.6 billion and operating margin approximately flat to\nprior year  (excluding the effects of the settlement  charge).  During the year,\nthe Company  presently  expects to open 25 new Cracker  Barrel  units and 18 new\nLogan\'s company-owned and five new franchised restaurants. The Company presently\nexpects  full-year cash provided by operating  activities to exceed its $160-165\nmillion  projected  capital  expenditure  requirements  by as much  as  $100-110\nmillion.  This would represent the sixth consecutive year in which cash provided\nby  operations  exceeded  outlays for the purchase of property and equipment and\nthe fifth  consecutive  year that the excess was at least $50 million.  As noted\nabove, the Company presently expects to resume repurchasing shares of its common\nstock in the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  2005,  and it has 2.9  million  shares\nremaining to repurchase under existing authorizations.\n\n     In  addition to the many risks and  uncertainties  listed at the end of the\nnarrative  portion of this press release,  the Company notes a certain  specific\nrisk that is excluded from its guidance,  but which likely would have a material\nimpact on its  guidance  if it  occurred.  The Company  noted that its  earnings\nguidance does not include the potential  effect of a change in accounting  rules\nfor convertible  debt proposed by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF 04-08) of\nthe  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  that  would  require  the  use  of\n"if-converted"  accounting  for  contingently  convertible  debt  regardless  of\nwhether the  contingency  allowing debt holders to convert is met. Under current\nrules (FAS 128),  contingently  issuable  shares  should be  included as diluted\nshares  outstanding  only when the  contingency  is met. The present  contingent\nconversion share price is $48.21,  and the Company\'s  convertible  notes may not\nactually be converted unless its common shares close at this price for 20 of the\n\n', u"\n\nlast 30 trading days of the present fiscal quarter.  This contingent  conversion\nprice increases over time. Should the rule change be adopted,  the Company would\nbe required to include  approximately  4.6 million  shares in its diluted shares\noutstanding  related to its convertible  debt. Had the accounting been in effect\nin fiscal 2004, the Company would have reported  diluted net income per share of\napproximately  $2.12 instead of $2.25,  including  the effect of the  settlement\ncharge.  The  likelihood  and  timing of  implementation  of the rule  change is\nuncertain.  The Company  noted that,  if  implemented,  the change would have no\neconomic  effect because the terms of the notes would be unchanged.  The Company\nhas not yet determined what response or change in policy,  if any, it would make\nif the new accounting took effect.\n\nFiscal 2004 Fourth-Quarter Conference Call\n\n         The live broadcast of CBRL Group's  quarterly  conference  call will be\navailable to the public  on-line at  www.vcall.com  or  www.cbrlgroup.com  today\nbeginning at 11:00 a.m.  (EDT).  The on-line replay will follow  immediately and\ncontinue through September 16, 2004.\n\nFiscal 2005 Calendar for Press Releases Disclosing Financial Results\n\n         As noted  earlier,  the Company will change its calendar for  scheduled\npress releases  disclosing its financial  results and earnings  guidance  during\nfiscal 2005.
