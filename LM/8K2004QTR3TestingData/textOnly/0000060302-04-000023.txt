Net sales increased\n13.5 percent, to $220.5 million, in the quarter ended July 31, 2004, compared\nwith $194.3 million for the same period last year.\n     R. H. Wollenberg, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer,\nsaid, "Our third quarter results reflect strengthening in demand in each of\nour operating segments and improved operating efficiency in each of our\nsegments compared to last year\'s third quarter.\n     "Demand and pricing for logs and lumber reflected a strong U.S. housing\nmarket and, although our log harvest plan calls for a sequential reduction in\nour timber harvest in the fourth quarter, we should continue to benefit from\nthe strong pricing environment.  The housing market is also buoying demand\nfor many of our specialty paper grades used in construction materials.  In\nour converted products segment, the Northwest has experienced an early and\nbountiful fruit-growing season that is already beginning to project into\nincreased seasonal demand for our fourth fiscal quarter.  Our order backlog\nreflects these healthy demand dynamics heading into what is typically our\nstrongest fiscal quarter.  The pricing outlook is more favorable than it has\nbeen in several years, with additional box and kraft paper price increases\nscheduled to take effect in August and September, following the price\nrecovery that began in the third quarter."\n     Mr. Wollenberg concluded, "Each of our operating segments appears\npoised for a strong fourth quarter."\n\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2004 Compared with the Third Quarter Fiscal 2003\n\n     Timber segment sales in the third quarter increased 35.9 percent, to\n$54.4 million from $40.1 million, and operating profit grew 67.4 percent, to\n$24.9 million from $14.9 million, compared with the same period last year.\nLog sales increased 35.0 percent on a 17.5 percent volume increase, coupled\nwith a 15.0 percent increase in average log prices.  Domestic log volume\nincreased 24.4 percent to 55.3 million board feet, while average prices\nincreased 20.5 percent compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2003 and 4.0\npercent sequentially.  Export log sales increased 7.9 percent as average\nprices increased 8.4 percent, partially offset by a 0.4 percent decrease in\nvolume, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2003.  Log volume reflected\nstrong demand and favorable summer harvest conditions.  The company\'s log\nharvest plan anticipates a fourth quarter timber sale of between 55 and 60\nmillion board feet and continued improvement in pricing.  Lumber sales\ncontinued to benefit from the strong U.S. housing market, increasing 39.0\npercent on a 43.5 percent increase in average lumber prices.  The price\nimprovement was partially offset by a 3.3 percent decrease in volume due to\nproduction curtailment caused by capital improvement projects during the\nthird quarter.\n     In the company\'s paper and paperboard segment, strengthening demand\nresulted in a 20.1 percent sales increase over last year\'s third quarter, to\n$63.9 million from $53.2 million.  Volume increased 26.6 percent.  The\nincreased volume resulted in an 83 percent utilization rate at the company\'s\nLongview mill, helping the segment cut its third quarter operating loss in\nhalf, to $1.4 million, compared with an operating loss of $3.0 million for\nthe same period last year.  In last year\'s third quarter, the Longview mill\noperated at 68 percent utilization.\n     The company expects a utilization rate of approximately 85 to 90\npercent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, which ends October 31, based on\nanticipated continued strengthening of cyclical demand coupled with strong\nseasonal demand.\n     Paper sales in the third quarter increased 10.6 percent to $51.2\nmillion from $46.3 million in the prior year period.  Paper volume increased\n11.9 percent, partially offset by a 1.2 percent price decline from the third\nquarter of 2003.  Domestic paper sales increased 13.6 percent over last\nyear\'s third quarter on a 15.1 percent increase in volume, partially offset\nby 1.2 percent lower average prices.  Sequentially, domestic paper prices\nimproved 5.3 percent, reflecting price increases that were implemented in the\nthird fiscal quarter.  Export paper sales declined 1.2 percent on a 3.3\npercent decrease in average price partially offset by a 1.7 percent increase\nin volume.\n     Paperboard sales in the third quarter increased 83.3 percent, to $12.7\nmillion from $6.9 million in the prior year period.  Domestic paperboard\nsales increased 83.0 percent over the third quarter of fiscal 2003 as volume\nincreased 98.9 percent, partially offset by a 9.3 percent decline in average\nprices due in part to product mix.  Export paperboard sales grew 83.6 percent\non 75.4 percent higher volume, coupled with a 4.7 percent increase in average\nprice.\n     Although paper and paperboard each had modest price declines year over\nyear, they showed sequential price improvements of 4.4 percent and 2.4\npercent, respectively, compared with second fiscal quarter 2004.\n     The company\'s converted products segment recorded a sales increase of\n1.1 percent from the third quarter of fiscal 2003, to $102.1 million from\n$101.0 million, reflecting a 1.0 percent volume increase.  Pricing improved\n2.1 percent sequentially from second fiscal quarter 2004, partially reversing\nthe price erosion experienced during the prior three quarters.  The segment\nreported an operating loss of $2.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal\n2004, compared with an operating loss of $1.5 million for the same period\nlast year, primarily due to higher cost of linerboard.\n     Cash provided by operations totaled $18.4 million during the third\nquarter.  Capital expenditures totaled $17.2 million, including $14.8 million\nin plant and equipment additions and $2.4 million in timber and timberland\npurchases.  The company also used approximately $3.0 million of its quarterly\ncash flow to reduce borrowed debt during the third quarter, bringing the\nbalance to approximately $495.1 million, $30.8 million below the balance one\nyear ago.\n\nInvestor Conference Call\n\n     The company will host a conference call Tuesday, August 24, 2004 at 11:00\na.m. Eastern Time (8:00 a.m. Pacific Time).
