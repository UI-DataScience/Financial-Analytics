We launched a\nnumber of successful proprietary products and acquired four companies, including\nEmed Co., the largest acquisition in Brady\'s history. And the broad success of\nour initiatives and cost control efforts have resulted in exceptional growth in\nour bottom line."\n\n         "We are increasing our guidance for fiscal 2005 to reflect a continued\npositive trend in growth in our base business, along with the recent acquisition\nof ID Technologies," said Brady Vice President and Chief Financial Officer David\nMathieson.
