"Financial results for both the fourth quarter\nand year-end met our expectations," said NetSol Chairman Najeeb U. Ghauri.

Additionally, these campaigns are already providing\na strong pipeline for the coming year."\n\n"Given our strong pipeline and recent industry growth forecasts, we are\nconfident in continued returns from our core IT consulting and services\nbusiness," commented Ghauri.
