Reports First Quarter Profit Increase\n\n    FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 14, 2004--National\nBeverage Corp. (AMEX:FIZ) today announced results for its first\nquarter ended July 31, 2004. For the quarter, sales were $146.5\nmillion with earnings of $8.9 million, or $.24 per share. For the\nprior comparable period, sales were similar and earnings were $8.5\nmillion, or $.23 per share.\n    "`OPPORTUNISTICALLY PERFECT\' was how we described our status\nrelative to future possibilities in our earnings release dated July\n20, 2004. Nothing has occurred to modify that statement," stated Nick\nA. Caporella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n    "Many circumstances affect the purchases of soft drinks and the\ncurrent consumer has to deal with more than ever before. `Heightened\nAwareness\' of just about everything is the explanation for softer than\nnormal sales during this quarter, which also included increased raw\nmaterial costs, while 42 quarters of sustained profits is the work\n.... of Team National," continued Caporella.\n    "While we continue to adjust pricing, we are \'on course\'\nstrategically with our new product launches and expect these\nincremental new revenues to produce higher margins not typical of the\ntraditional carbonated soft drink industry," Caporella stated.\n    "We have previously stated that fiscal year 2005 will surely\nprovide our best performance to date and we stand solidly with that\nstatement," concluded Caporella.\n    National Beverage produces soft drinks, bottled waters, juices and\njuice products and is highly recognized for a line of refreshing\nflavors through its popular brands: Shasta(R), Faygo(R), Ritz(R),\nEverfresh(R), Mr. Pure(R), LaCroix(R) and Rip It(R).\n\n    Fun & Flavor ... the National Beverage Way\n\n\n                     National Beverage Corp.\n        Consolidated Results for the Three Months Ended\n                July 31, 2004 and August 2, 2003\n           (in thousands, except per share amounts)\n\n\n                                                 Three Months Ended\n                                                 -------------------\n                                                 July 31,   August 2,\n                                                   2004       2003\n                                                 ---------  ---------\n\n\nNet Sales                                        $146,512   $145,665\n                                                 =========  =========\n\nNet Income                                       $  8,856   $  8,450\n                                                 =========  =========\n\nNet Income Per Share:\n  Basic                                          $    .24   $    .23\n                                                 =========  =========\n  Diluted                                        $    .23   $    .22\n                                                 =========  =========\n\nAverage Common Shares Outstanding:\n  Basic                                            37,560     36,834\n                                                 =========  =========\n  Diluted                                          38,264     38,138\n                                                 =========  =========\n\n    This press release includes forward-looking statements within the\nmeaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
