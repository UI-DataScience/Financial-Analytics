(NYSE-PKE) reported sales  of  $51,098,000\nfor  the second quarter ended August 29, 2004 compared to  sales\nfrom continuing operations of $43,566,000 for the second quarter\nof  last  year.   Park\'s  sales for the first  six  months  were\n$109,616,000  compared  to sales from continuing  operations  of\n$87,889,000 for last year\'s first six months.\n\nPark  reported net earnings of $2,947,000 for the second  quarter\nended August 29, 2004 compared to net earnings of $19,038,000 for\nlast  fiscal year\'s second quarter ended August 31, 2003.  During\nthe  prior year\'s second quarter, the Company realized a  pre-tax\ngain  of  $33,088,000  related to the  payment  of  the  judgment\nagainst  Delco Electronics Corporation resulting from the lawsuit\nfiled against Delco, and the Company incurred pre-tax charges  of\n$6,504,000 related to the realignment of its North American  FR-4\nbusiness  operations.   As a result, net profit  from  continuing\noperations  before special items for last year\'s  second  quarter\nwas $1,098,000.\n\nFor  the  six month period ended August 29, 2004, Park  reported\nnet   earnings  of  $8,968,000  compared  to  net  earnings   of\n$10,587,000  for  last year\'s first six month period.   For  the\nprior year\'s first six month period, the Company reported a pre-\ntax gain of $33,088,000 related to the Delco lawsuit and pre-tax\ncharges of $8,438,000 related to realignment costs. As a result,\nnet  profit from continuing operations before special items  for\nlast year\'s first six month period was $512,000.\n\nPark  reported  diluted  earnings per share  of  $.15  and  $.45,\nrespectively, for the second quarter and six months ended  August\n29, 2004 compared to diluted earnings per share of $.95 and $.53,\nrespectively, for last year\'s second quarter and first six  month\nperiod.   Diluted  earnings per share from continuing  operations\nbefore  special items were $.06 and $.03, respectively, for  last\nyear\'s second quarter and first six month period.\n\nBrian  Shore, Park\'s President and CEO, said, "When we  announced\nour  first quarter results on June 30, 2004, I commented that  it\nappeared  that our industry had very recently begun to slow  down\nto  some extent.  With the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, it appears\nthat  our  observation regarding the industry\'s slowing down  was\ncorrect.  As a matter of fact, throughout the second quarter, our\nbusiness  operated  at  levels below  the  levels  of  the  first\nquarter.   Obviously,  the question many  of  you  will  have  is\nwhether  our  global industry will now begin  to  pick  back  up,\nespecially since the summer is over.  Unfortunately,   there  are\nno  clear  signals at this time as to whether the global industry\nclimate  will improve during the remainder of the calendar  year.\nAlthough  we  continue  to  grow and expand  and  invest  in  our\nbusiness  in  Asia,  we have made additional adjustments  to  our\nvolume  FR-4 oriented businesses, particularly in North  America.\nAs  I have explained in the past, although we are fully committed\nto  our existing FR-4 customers in North America and Europe, I do\nnot believe that our volume FR-4 businesses will be the driver of\nour company\'s future.  As a result, we continue to transition our\ntraditional  volume  FR-4  manufacturing  facilities  to   higher\ntechnology  product manufacturing.  As I have also  explained  on\nnumerous occasions, we run our business for the long term, and we\nmake  adjustments to our business operations only when we believe\nit  is in the long-term interest of our company to do so.  In any\ncase, regardless as to what business levels we see over the  next\nthree months or six months or twelve months, we continue the long\nand   difficult  process  of  reinventing  our  company  into   a\ntechnology  company.  We believe this reinvention of our  company\nis essential for our future regardless as to what business levels\nwe experience over the short term."\n\nThe  Company  will  conduct  a conference  call  to  discuss  its\nfinancial  results  at 11:00 a.m. EDT today. Forward-looking  and\nother  material  information may be discussed in this  conference\ncall. The conference call dial-in number is (800) 289-0528.\n\nFor  those  unable to listen to the call live, a conference  call\nreplay  will be available from approximately 2:00 p.m. EDT  today\nthrough  11:59  p.m.  EDT  on Monday,  September  27,  2004.

Accordingly, in addition to disclosing  its\nfinancial  results  determined in  accordance  with  GAAP,  Park\ndiscloses non-GAAP operating results that exclude special  items\nin  order  to  assist  its shareholders  and  other  readers  in\nassessing  the  company\'s operating performance.  Such  non-GAAP\nfinancial  measures  are  provided  to  supplement  the  results\nprovided in accordance with GAAP.\n\nCertain  portions  of  this  press  release  may  be  deemed  to\nconstitute  forward  looking  statements  that  are  subject  to\nvarious  factors  which  could cause actual  results  to  differ\nmaterially from Park\'s expectations.  Such factors include,  but\nare  not  limited  to,  general conditions  in  the  electronics\nindustry,  Park\'s  competitive position, the  status  of  Park\'s\nrelationships   with  its  customers,  economic  conditions   in\ninternational  markets, the cost and availability of  utilities,\nand  the  various  factors set forth under the caption  "Factors\nThat  May  Affect Future Results" after Item 7 of Park\'s  Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2004.\n\nPark  Electrochemical  Corp. is a leading  global  designer  and\nproducer  of  electronic  materials used  to  fabricate  complex\nmultilayer  printed circuit boards and interconnection  systems.\nPark  specializes  in advanced materials for  high  layer  count\ncircuit   boards   and  high-speed  digital   and   RF/Microwave\nelectronic systems.
