(NASDAQ:\nNOBH) announced sales and earnings results for its third quarter ended July 31,\n2004.

Income from operations for the first nine months improved 68% to\n$4,276,005 versus $2,542,522 in the same period last year.

Diluted earnings per\nshare were up 48% to $0.77 per share versus last year\'s nine months results of\n$0.52 per share.\n         Nobility\'s financial position continued to improve during the third\nquarter of 2004 and remains very strong with cash and cash equivalents, short\nand long-term investments of $17,358,976 and no outstanding debt.

Latest three-month manufactured\nhousing industry shipments nationwide, declined an estimated 6%, and industry\nshipments in Florida, our primary market, were up an estimated 16%", President\nTerry Trexler said.\n         Trexler continued, "Although Nobility continues to out-perform the\nindustry, in the near term we anticipate continued pressure on both sales and\nearnings resulting from these factors, plus continuous price increases in\nlumber, OSB, sheetrock, steel and oil related products and services. Management\nis optimistic for the remainder of fiscal 2004, convinced that our specific\ngeographic market is one of the best long-term growth areas in the country and\nbecause of the strong operating leverage inherent in the Company. With an\nimproving economy, better consumer confidence, declining unemployment claims,\nand increasing but still low interest rates in 2004, management expects the\ndemand for our homes to improve. Increase demand also could result from building\nreplacement homes due to the recent hurricanes in Florida. The Company is well\npositioned to capitalize on the demand in the future by controlling the retail\ndistribution, financing, and insuring of our homes and by being financially\nsound to take advantage of opportunities as they develop."\n         Nobility Homes, Inc. has specialized for the past 37 years in the\ndesign and production of quality, affordable manufactured homes at its two\nplants located in central Florida. With 17 Company owned retail sales centers, a\nfinance company joint venture, and an insurance subsidiary, Nobility is the only\nvertically integrated manufactured home company headquartered in Florida.\n\n         MANAGEMENT WILL HOLD A CONFERENCE CALL ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 2004,\nAT 4:30 PM EASTERN TIME.
