Gross margin was 90% for its fiscal 2005 second\nquarter compared to 91% for its fiscal 2004 second quarter.\n\nThe Company reported net income of $1.4 million, or $0.01 per basic and diluted\nshare, for its fiscal 2005 second quarter. Fiscal 2005 second quarter net income\nincludes a charge of $2.3 million, or $0.02 per basic and diluted share, for\npurchased technology and related costs in connection with the Company\'s\nacquisition of virtual classroom software (as discussed further below) and\nrestructuring and other non-recurring expenses of $1.1 million, or $0.01 per\nbasic and diluted share. Fiscal 2005 second quarter net income was also impacted\nby the Company\'s revision of its projected tax rate for the year. The Company\nnow expects to record a tax provision for fiscal 2005 in a range of 4.5% to 6.0%\ncompared to its previously estimated tax provision range of 28.0% to 32.0%. This\nchange in effective tax rate is based primarily upon the Company\'s ability to\nrealize the full benefit of certain tax deductions related to that portion of\nthe NETg settlement paid in fiscal 2005. The effective tax rate change resulted\nin a tax benefit in the fiscal 2005 second quarter of $1.1 million, or $0.01 per\nbasic and diluted share.\n\nSkillSoft reported a net loss of $53.2 million, or $0.53 per basic and diluted\nshare, for the fiscal 2004 second quarter, which included $44.0 million, or\n$0.44 per basic and diluted share, for the settlement of its NETg litigation and\nrestructuring and other non-recurring expenses of $5.0 million, or $0.05 per\nbasic and diluted share, primarily for costs incurred due to the restatement of\nthe historical SmartForce PLC financial statements.\n\n"We are pleased that our second quarter results are in line with the revenue and\nEPS ranges we discussed at the end of the first quarter. Nevertheless, we\ncontinue to devote significant effort to growing our sales going forward in a\nchallenging market for IT spending" said Chuck Moran, President and Chief\nExecutive Officer. "One strategy for sales growth that we are pursuing is the\ninvestment in\n', u'\nnew products that will create new business opportunities for the Company. As\npart of this strategy, we are very excited about the virtual classroom blended\nlearning solution that we plan to introduce in the fourth quarter of fiscal\n2005. We view this new product offering, which is based on technology we\nacquired in the second quarter, as a sales growth opportunity that fits our\nfinancial model of high gross margins, can be sold through our existing sales\nchannels, provides us with a competitive differentiator and continues to\nincrease SkillSoft\'s offerings that address our customers\' blended learning\nsolution requirements," commented Moran.\n\nThe Company\'s gross margin was 90% for the fiscal 2005 second quarter compared\nto 91% in the fiscal 2004 second quarter. The slight decrease is mainly due to a\nhigher mix of royalty bearing revenue in the fiscal 2005 second quarter.\nResearch and development expenses decreased to $10.3 million in the fiscal 2005\nsecond quarter compared to $12.7 million in the fiscal 2004 second quarter due\nto the completion of merger-related research and development and incremental\nresearch and development regarding the Company\'s initiative for content and\nplatform improvements. Sales and marketing expenses decreased to $22.7 million\nin the fiscal 2005 second quarter from $23.2 million in the fiscal 2004 second\nquarter. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in marketing expense in\nthe fiscal 2005 second quarter. General and administrative expenses decreased to\n$6.2 million in the fiscal 2005 second quarter compared to $6.4 million in the\nfiscal 2004 second quarter mainly due to lower legal expense. Amortization of\nintangible assets and deferred compensation in the fiscal 2005 second quarter\nwas $2.7 million, or $0.03 per basic and $0.02 per diluted share, compared to\n$3.0 million, or $0.03 per basic and diluted share, in the fiscal 2004 second\nquarter. Restructuring and other non-recurring charges decreased to $1.1 million\nin the fiscal 2005 second quarter as compared to $5.0 million in the fiscal 2004\nsecond quarter. This expense decreased primarily due to the completion of the\nrestatement of the SmartForce PLC historical financial statements in the fiscal\nyear ended January 31, 2004. The restructuring and non-recurring expense\nreflected in the fiscal 2005 second quarter relates primarily to the ongoing SEC\ninvestigation, the re-filing of statutory tax returns as a result of the\nrestatement of the SmartForce PLC historical financial statements, and costs\nassociated with international restructuring activities.\n\nSkillSoft had approximately $87.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term\ninvestments and restricted cash as of July 31, 2004 compared to $106.5 million\nas of April 30, 2004. The decrease in cash is primarily due to the Company\nmaking the final payment of $22.0 million in connection with the NETg litigation\nsettlement and the final payment of $6.0 million in connection with the 1998\nsecurities class action settlement. At the end of July 2004, the court granted a\npreliminary approval order relating to the 2002 securities class action\nsettlement. As a result, we made the first half of the 2002 securities class\naction settlement payment, or $15.25 million, in August 2004, which reduced our\ncash, cash equivalents and short-term investments from the July 31, 2004\nbalance.\n\nIn order to adequately assess the Company\'s collection efforts, taking into\naccount the seasonality of the Company\'s business, the Company believes that it\nis most useful to compare current period days sales outstanding (DSOs) to the\nprior year period. Given the quarterly seasonality of bookings, the deferral\nfrom revenue of subscription billings may increase or decrease the DSOs on\nsequential quarterly comparisons.\n\nSkillSoft\'s DSOs were in the targeted range for the fiscal 2005 second quarter.\nOn a net basis, which considers only receivable balances for which revenue has\nbeen recorded, DSOs were 9 days in the fiscal 2005 second quarter as compared to\n14 days in the year ago period and 12 days in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.\nOn a gross basis, which considers all items billed as receivables, DSOs were 77\ndays in the fiscal 2005 second quarter compared to 106 days in the year ago\nquarter and 76 days in the fiscal 2005 first quarter.\n\nSkillSoft had deferred revenue of approximately $113.0 million as of July 31,\n2004, which reflects a decrease of $5.3 million compared to the approximately\n$118.3 million as of April 30, 2004. This decrease is mainly the result of a\nhigher proportion of quarterly billing contracts as compared to annual\n', u"\nbilling contracts signed in the fiscal 2005 second quarter, as quarterly billing\ncontracts yield less deferred revenue than annual billing contracts in the\nquarter in which they are signed.\n\nFISCAL 2005 OUTLOOK\n\nThe Company's targeted revenue range of $221 million to $225 million and\ntargeted net income range of $21.0 million to $24.0 million, or $0.20 to $0.22\nper basic and diluted share, for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2005 (fiscal\n2005) remains unchanged. Although the Company's earnings outlook for fiscal 2005\nremains unchanged, it has been impacted by two separate events. First, the\nannual earnings outlook has been impacted by $6.5 million of incurred and\nprojected additional expenses in fiscal 2005 associated with the virtual\nclassroom product offering. These expenses include:\n\n      -     $2.3 million for purchased technology and related development\n            expense in the second quarter ended July 31, 2004;\n\n      -     $1.4 million of incremental research and development expense\n            anticipated to be paid to an outside party for the modification of\n            the purchased technology that is expected to occur in the third\n            quarter ending October 31, 2004;\n\n      -     $0.8 million regarding the final payment for the purchased\n            technology anticipated in the fourth quarter ending January 31,\n            2005; and\n\n      -     $2.0 million of incremental hosting, software amortization and sales\n            and marketing expenses over the final two quarters of fiscal 2005 to\n            support the launch of the virtual classroom offering.\n\nSecond, these costs are expected to be offset by a reduction in the Company's\nprovision for income tax as a result of the tax treatment applied to the NETg\nsettlement. Although that settlement was reflected in the fiscal 2004 results of\noperations for accounting purposes, due to the timing of the cash payments to\nNETg, $22.0 million of the settlement amount will be included as a deduction in\nthe calculation of the fiscal 2005 provision for income tax. After giving effect\nto both the additional expenses associated with the virtual classroom software\nacquisition and the tax benefit described above, the Company's targeted\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) net income for fiscal 2005\nremains unchanged, at between $21.0 million and $24.0 million, or $0.20 to $0.22\nper basic and diluted share.\n\nThe Company's quarterly revenue targets for the fiscal 2005 third and fourth\nquarters as set forth in its press release issued on June 3, 2004 remain\nunchanged at $52.0 to $56.0 million and $64.0 to $67.0 million, respectively.\nThe Company's quarterly earnings targets for the fiscal 2005 third and fourth\nquarters as set forth in its press release issued on June 3, 2004 remain\nunchanged at $0.04 to $0.055 and $0.105 to $0.125, respectively, per basic and\ndiluted share.\n\nThe Company now anticipates that annual capital expenditures will be in the\nrange of $9.0 million to $10.0 million as compared to the previous range of $7.5\nmillion to $8.5 million. This increase is due to additional capital expenditures\nexpected to be made to introduce SkillSoft's virtual classroom product offering\nlater in this fiscal year. The Company expects its cash position to be\napproximately $62.0 to $70.0 million as of January 31, 2005 taking into\nconsideration the additional cash needed for the purchased virtual classroom\ntechnology, related operating expense and related incremental capital\nexpenditures.\n\nThe Company is assessing the impact of the recent SEC action against a former\nSmartForce executive to determine the expenses to SkillSoft that are expected to\nresult under its director and officer indemnification arrangements. The earnings\noutlook described above includes $500,000 per quarter to cover all SkillSoft\nexpenses associated with the SEC investigation and the re-filing of tax returns\nrelating to the restatement of the SmartForce historical financial statements.\nThe earnings outlook described above would have to be revised if these expenses\nare higher.\n", u'\nThe Company\'s outlook excludes the impact of potential restructuring charges, as\nwell as the potential impact of any future acquisitions or divestitures,\nincluding potential non-recurring acquisition related expenses. The outlook also\nexcludes the effect of financing arrangements and Company stock buyback\ntransactions that could impact outstanding shares and thereby the Company\'s EPS\noutlook.\n\nCONFERENCE CALL\n\nIn conjunction with the release, management will conduct a conference call on\nWednesday, September 1, 2004 at 5:00 p.m. ET to discuss the Company\'s fiscal\n2005 second quarter and fiscal 2005 outlook.
