The\nCompany posted a net loss of $1.3 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the\nfirst quarter of fiscal 2005, compared with a net loss of $808,000, or $0.11\nper diluted share, in the same period of the prior year.\n\n"We are pleased with our increased sales performance," said Rhea Posedel,\nchairman and chief executive officer of Aehr Test Systems.  "We had a\nproductive quarter, which included follow-on orders for, and the successful\nshipment and installation of, MTX Fp+ systems in Asia.  The Company\'s gross\nmargins were lower than normal during the quarter, primarily because of the\nsubstantial amount of pass-through products included in the multi-million\ndollar MTX Fp+ turnkey orders announced previously.  We expect gross margins to\nimprove in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, as most of the pass-through\nproducts associated with these orders were shipped by the end of the first\nquarter of fiscal 2005.\n\n"The interest level for our FOX(TM) full wafer contact products has picked up,\nas the demand for stacked packages is driving the need for burned-in and tested\nbare die," continued Mr. Posedel.  "We believe Aehr Test will benefit from this\nover the long-term as we penetrate new market opportunities with our innovative\nFOX family of wafer level test and burn-in products."\n\nAt August 31, 2004, cash, short-term investments and long-term investments were\n$10.9 million, compared to $11.8 million at the end of fiscal 2004.  Aehr Test\nclosed the first quarter of fiscal 2005 with no outstanding debt and\nshareholders\' equity of $20.9 million, or $2.82 per diluted share.\n\n                                    -more-\n\n', u'\n"While we believe that fiscal second quarter net sales will show improvement\nover the same period in the prior year, we are anticipating a net sales decline\nwhen compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2005, primarily because of the\nreduction in pass-through product shipments," said Gary Larson, vice president\nand chief financial officer of Aehr Test Systems.  "We do, however, anticipate\nsequential improvements in gross margins and on the bottom line."\n\nMANAGEMENT CONFERENCE CALL\nManagement of Aehr Test will host a conference call and webcast today, Tuesday,\nSeptember 21, 2004 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern (2:00 p.m. Pacific) to discuss the\nCompany\'s fiscal 2005 first quarter results.

Aehr\nTest has developed and introduced several innovative products, including the\nFOX, MTX, MAX3 and MAX4 systems, and the DiePak(R) carrier.  The FOX system is\na full wafer contact test and burn-in system.  The MTX system is a massively\nparallel test system designed to reduce the cost of memory testing by\nperforming both test and burn-in on thousands of devices simultaneously.  The\nMAX system can effectively burn-in and functionally test complex devices, such\nas digital signal processors, microprocessors, microcontrollers and systems-on-\na-chip.  The DiePak carrier is a reusable, temporary package that enables IC\nmanufacturers to perform cost-effective final test and burn-in of bare die.\nFor more information, please visit the Company\'s website at www.aehr.com.\n\nSAFE HARBOR STATEMENT\nThis release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and\nuncertainties relating to projections regarding industry growth and customer\ndemand for Aehr Test\'s products as well as projections regarding Aehr Test\'s\nfuture financial performance.
