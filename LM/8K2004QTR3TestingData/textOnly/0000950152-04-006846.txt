POSTS RESULTS FOR SECOND QUARTER & SIX MONTHS ENDED 2004\nMonday, September 13, 8:31 am ET\n\nREVENUE & INCOME CLIMB SHARPLY\n\nPITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)--September 13, 2004--PDG Environmental, Inc. (OTC\nBB: PDGE - News), an environmental and specialty contractor, today reported\nfinancial results for the second quarter and six-months ended July 31, 2004.\n\nRevenues for the second quarter were $15.2 million, a 61% increase over the $9.5\nmillion in the same prior-year period. Net income for the quarter doubled to\n$295,000, or $0.02 per fully diluted share as compared to the previous year\'s\nsecond quarter net income of $146,000, or $0.02 per fully diluted share.\n\nRevenues for the six months ended July 31, 2004 were $26.1 million, a 46%\nincrease over the $17.8 million in the same prior-year period. Net income for\nthe six months was up 30% to $484,000, or $0.04 per fully diluted share as\ncompared to the previous year\'s first half net income of $373,000, or $0.04 per\nfully diluted share. Despite the increase in profit for the quarter and six\nmonths, diluted earnings per share remained the same due to the investment made\nby Barron Partners in February 2004.\n\nJohn Regan, Chairman and CEO, commented, "The ramp up in project workload that\nbegan late in the first quarter continued strongly in the second quarter to\nnear-record levels. We did experience some labor shortages and productivity\nissues related to this rapid expansion, which now appear to be corrected."\n\nHe added, "Going into the second half of the year, our normal contracted backlog\nremains strong at $35.8 million. In addition, we are experiencing a tremendous\ndemand for PDGE\'s various services as a result of the unfortunate devastation in\nFlorida from Hurricanes Charley and Frances. In addition to the immediate\ndisaster response, which is being handled by our Tampa and Ft. Lauderdale\nlocations, the extensive flooding and water damage is expected to create\nincreased demand for our mold remediation services in the months to come. This\nwill likely translate into continued significant growth in the second half."\n', u"\n                                      -2-\n\nPDG Environmental, Inc., is an environmental and specialty contractor providing\nasbestos and lead abatement, insulation, microbial remediation and demolition\nand related services dedicated to assisting its commercial, industrial and\ngovernmental clients in complying with environmental laws and regulations.\nRegional marketing and project operations are conducted through branch offices\nlocated in New York City, NY; Paramus, NJ; Hazelton and Export, PA; Fort\nLauderdale and Tampa, FL; Houston and Pasadena, TX; Phoenix, AZ; Rock Hill, SC;\nPortland, OR; Seattle, WA; and Los Angeles, CA.
