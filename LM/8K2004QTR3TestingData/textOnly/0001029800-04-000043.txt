REPORTS\n               FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004\n\n         GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT, September 9, 2004 - Urstadt Biddle Properties\nInc. (NYSE:UBA and UBP), a real estate investment trust, today announced its\nfinancial results for the three months and nine months ended July 31, 2004.\n\nNet income applicable to Common and Class A Common stockholders for the quarter\nwas $4,154,000 or $0.15 per diluted Common share and $0.17 per diluted Class A\nCommon share, compared to $4,527,000, or $0.17 per diluted Common share and\n$0.19 per diluted Class A Common share in the corresponding three month period\nlast year. Funds from operations (diluted) "FFO" for the quarter ended July 31,\n2004 was $7,074,000 or $0.26 per diluted Common share and $0.28 per diluted\nClass A Common share compared to $7,283,000 or $0.27 per diluted Common share\nand $.30 per diluted Class A Common share in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.\n\nFor the nine months ended July 31, 2004, net income applicable to Common and\nClass A Common stockholders was $13,917,000 or $0.52 per diluted Common share\nand $0.57 per diluted Class A Common share compared to $12,920,000 or $0.48 per\ndiluted Common share and $0.54 per diluted Class A Common share for the same\nperiod last year. FFO for the nine months ended July 31, 2004 increased to\n$22,514,000 or $0.82 per Common share and $0.90 per Class A Common share from\n$20,792,000 or $0.76 per diluted Common share and $0.84 per diluted Class A\nCommon share for the same period in fiscal 2003.\n\nA reconciliation of FFO to net income applicable to Common and Class A Common\nstockholders, the GAAP measure the Company believes to be the most directly\ncomparable, is in the financial tables accompanying this press release.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter, the gross leasable area (GLA) of the Company\'s\ncore properties were approximately 98% leased, an increase of approximately 1%\nsince the beginning of the fiscal year and unchanged since the second quarter of\n2004. The Company leased or renewed 236,000 square feet of space in the first\nnine months of the year.\n\nCommenting on the quarter\'s results, Willing L. Biddle, President and Chief\nOperating Officer of UBP, said "We continue to improve the quality of our\nshopping center portfolio through aggressive leasing and management of our\nproperties. Demand for retail space is strong in our markets, however we\ncontinue to be challenged by vacancies in our non-core office property in\nSouthfield, Michigan caused by a weak office leasing market."\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2004, the Company acquired four properties totaling\n38,000 square feet at an aggregate cost of approximately $11 million and assumed\n$4.7 million in mortgage loans in connection with the acquisitions. In September\n2004, the Company entered into a contract to purchase a shopping center\ncontaining approximately 250,000 square feet of leasable space located in its\ntarget acquisition market for approximately $50 million. The contract to\npurchase is subject to various conditions, including customary closing\nconditions, and therefore, there can be no assurance as to when or if the\ntransaction will be completed.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nFunds from Operations ("FFO")\n\nThe Company reports Funds from Operations ("FFO") in addition to its net income\napplicable to common stockholders and net cash provided by operating activities.\nThe Company has adopted the definition suggested by The National Association of\nReal Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") and defines FFO to mean net income\n(computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of\nproperty, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization , and after\nadjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures.\n\nThe Company considers FFO a meaningful, additional measure of operating\nperformance because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the\nreal estate assets diminishes predictably over time and industry analysts have\naccepted it as a performance measure. FFO is presented to assist investors in\nanalyzing the operating performance of the Company. It is helpful as it excludes\nvarious items included in the net income that are not indicators of the\nCompany\'s operating performance, such as gains (or losses) from sales of\nproperty and depreciation and amortization. However, FFO:\n|X|  does not represent cash flows from operating  activities in accordance with\n     GAAP  (which,   unlike  FFO,   generally   reflects  all  cash  effects  of\n     transactions and other events in the determination of net income) and;\n|X|  should not be considered an  alternative  to net income as an indication of\n     our performance.\nFFO, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled items reported\nby other real estate investment trusts due to possible differences in the\napplication of the NAREIT definition as used by such REITs.\n\nUBP is a self-administered equity real estate trust providing investors with a\nmeans of participating in ownership of income-producing properties with\ninvestment liquidity. UBP has paid 139 quarters of uninterrupted dividends since\nits inception in 1969.\n\nCertain statements contained herein may constitute "forward-looking statements"\nwithin the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
