As a result, TEP adopted new methodology to estimate unbilled revenues.\nUniSource Energy and TEP will amend their prior Securities and Exchange\nCommission filings on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 and on Form\n10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 to reflect the effect of these\nprocedural changes in its prior financial statements. These changes will result\nin TEP (and UniSource Energy on a consolidated basis) recognizing additional net\nincome of $1.3 million in 2003, $1.7 million in 2002, and $2.5 million in 2001.\nThe restated net income for UniSource Energy is $113.9 million in 2003, $34.9\nmillion in 2002 and $63.8 million in 2001. In addition, the effect of restating\nperiods prior to 2001 resulted in an $11.3 million increase in common stock\nequity from $374.2 million to $385.5 million as of December 31, 2000.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2004, TEP\'s utility gross margin (total operating\nrevenues minus fuel and purchased energy) increased $14 million, or 10%,\ncompared with the second quarter of 2003. In the three months ended June 30,\n2003, UniSource Energy\'s restated earnings of $7 million, or $0.20 per share,\nreflect the impact of unplanned plant outages which led to reduced wholesale\nenergy sales and higher replacement power costs.\n\n"Our strong performance reflects the reliability of our utility operations,\ncontinued growth in our service territories and the dedication of our\nemployees," said James S. Pignatelli, Chairman, President and Chief Executive\nOfficer. "We haven\'t allowed our company\'s pending acquisition to distract us\nfrom our central mission to meet the needs of our customers and deliver results\nfor shareholders."\n\nIn November 2003, UniSource Energy entered into an agreement that provides for\nthe acquisition of all of the company\'s outstanding common stock for $25.25 per\nshare by Saguaro Utility Group L.P., an Arizona limited partnership whose\ngeneral partner is Sage Mountain, L.L.C. and whose limited partners include\ninvestment funds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., L.P., J.P.\nMorgan Partners, LLC, and Wachovia Capital Partners. UniSource Energy\'s\nshareholders voted on March 29, 2004 to approve the acquisition agreement. The\n\n\n', u"\n\n\nacquisition, which also requires certain regulatory approvals, is expected to\noccur in the fourth quarter of 2004. Results from the second quarter of 2004\nincluded $1 million in expenses related to the proposed acquisition of UniSource\nEnergy\n\nUniSource Energy Services (UES), a subsidiary that provides natural gas and\nelectricity in northern and southern Arizona, contributed $0.5 million to second\nquarter earnings. Millennium Energy Holdings (MEH), which oversees UniSource\nEnergy's unregulated investments, reported a net loss of $3 million in the\nsecond quarter of 2004 after recording a net loss of $4 million in the same\nperiod last year.\n\nTUCSON ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY\n\nTEP reported second quarter earnings of $18 million, or $0.52 per UniSource\nEnergy share, compared with restated earnings of $14 million, or $0.40 per\nUniSource Energy share, in the same period last year. Retail kilowatt-hour (kWh)\nsales increased 5 percent in the second quarter of 2004 over the same period\nlast year.\n\nRetail revenues increased by $12 million compared with the second quarter of\n2003. TEP's retail customer base grew 2 percent to 370,894 between the second\nquarters of 2003 and 2004.\n\nHigher power prices and the increased availability of TEP's coal-fired\ngenerating facilities during the second quarter of 2004 led to a $7 million\nincrease in TEP's wholesale revenues compared to the same period last year.\nWholesale power prices on the Dow Jones Palo Verde Index averaged $44 per\nmegawatt-hour (MWh) during the second quarter of 2004, compared with $39 per MWh\nduring the second quarter of 2003. Energy output from TEP's coal-fired\ngenerating facilities increased 10% in the second quarter of 2004 over the same\nperiod last year.\n\nOther factors affecting TEP's earnings include a $4 million increase in\nTransition Recovery Asset amortization and a $3 million decline in total\ninterest expense resulting from lower rates under TEP's credit agreement and\nlower capital lease obligation balances compared with last year. TEP recorded a\n$3 million reserve in the second quarter of 2004 to further reduce the amount of\nits outstanding receivable related to wholesale sales made to California in 2001\nand 2000 that it believes are collectible. This amount was recorded as a\nreduction to wholesale revenue.\n\nUNISOURCE ENERGY SERVICES\n\nUES reported earnings of $0.5 million, or $0.02 per UniSource Energy share. The\nutility began providing gas and electric service through UNS Gas and UNS\nElectric in northern and southern Arizona in August 2003. During the second\nquarter of 2004, UNS Electric recorded retail revenues of $35 million, while UNS\nGas produced retail revenues of $21 million.\n\nCustomer growth at UES remains strong. Both UNS Gas' and UNS Electric's retail\ncustomer bases grew by over 1 percent during the second quarter of 2004.\n\n\n", u"\n\n\nMILLENNIUM ENERGY HOLDINGS\n\nMEH reported a net loss of $3 million, or $0.10 per UniSource Energy share,\ncompared with a loss of $4 million in the second quarter of 2003. Global Solar\nEnergy, a MEH subsidiary, lost $2 million during the second quarter of 2004,\ncompared with a loss of $4 million in the same period last year.\n\nYEAR-TO-DATE\n\nUniSource Energy's consolidated year-to-date earnings through June 30, 2004,\nwere $19 million, or $0.56 per share, compared to $59 million, or $1.75 per\nshare, during the same period last year as restated.\n\nLast year's results reflected the adoption of Financial Accounting Standard 143\n(FAS 143), a new rule related to accounting for plant retirement and removal\ncosts. TEP recorded a $67 million after-tax gain, or $2.00 per UniSource Energy\nshare, in the first quarter of 2003 as a result of adopting FAS 143. Excluding\nthe impact of FAS 143, UniSource Energy's consolidated year-to-date restated\nloss through June 2003 was $8 million, or $0.25 per share.\n\nQUARTERLY AND YEAR-TO-DATE EARNINGS PER SHARE SUMMARY\n\n", u'\n', u'\n                                                   2ND QUARTER\n                                               2004          2003\nPer UniSource Energy share                                (RESTATED)\n- ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n', u' ', u' ', u'\nTucson Electric Power                          $0.52         $0.40\nUniSource Energy Services (1)                   0.02            -\nMillenium Energy Holdings                      (0.10)        (0.13)\nInter-Company and Other                        (0.07)        (0.07)\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------\nUniSource Energy Consolidated                  $0.37         $0.20\n====================================================================\nAvg.

As a result, TEP adopted new methodology to estimate unbilled revenues.\nUniSource Energy and TEP will amend their prior Securities and Exchange\nCommission filings on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 and on Form\n10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 to reflect the effect of these\nprocedural changes in its prior financial statements. These changes will result\nin TEP (and UniSource Energy on a consolidated basis) recognizing additional net\nincome of $1.3 million in 2003, $1.7 million in 2002, and $2.5 million in 2001.\nThe restated net income for UniSource Energy is $113.9 million in 2003, $34.9\nmillion in 2002 and $63.8 million in 2001. In addition, the effect of restating\nperiods prior to 2001 resulted in an $11.3 million increase in common stock\nequity from $374.2 million to $385.5 million as of December 31, 2000.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2004, TEP\'s utility gross margin (total operating\nrevenues minus fuel and purchased energy) increased $14 million, or 10%,\ncompared with the second quarter of 2003. In the three months ended June 30,\n2003, UniSource Energy\'s restated earnings of $7 million, or $0.20 per share,\nreflect the impact of unplanned plant outages which led to reduced wholesale\nenergy sales and higher replacement power costs.\n\n"Our strong performance reflects the reliability of our utility operations,\ncontinued growth in our service territories and the dedication of our\nemployees," said James S. Pignatelli, Chairman, President and Chief Executive\nOfficer. "We haven\'t allowed our company\'s pending acquisition to distract us\nfrom our central mission to meet the needs of our customers and deliver results\nfor shareholders."\n\nIn November 2003, UniSource Energy entered into an agreement that provides for\nthe acquisition of all of the company\'s outstanding common stock for $25.25 per\nshare by Saguaro Utility Group L.P., an Arizona limited partnership whose\ngeneral partner is Sage Mountain, L.L.C. and whose limited partners include\ninvestment funds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., L.P., J.P.\nMorgan Partners, LLC, and Wachovia Capital Partners. UniSource Energy\'s\nshareholders voted on March 29, 2004 to approve the acquisition agreement. The\n\n\n', u"\n\n\nacquisition, which also requires certain regulatory approvals, is expected to\noccur in the fourth quarter of 2004. Results from the second quarter of 2004\nincluded $1 million in expenses related to the proposed acquisition of UniSource\nEnergy\n\nUniSource Energy Services (UES), a subsidiary that provides natural gas and\nelectricity in northern and southern Arizona, contributed $0.5 million to second\nquarter earnings. Millennium Energy Holdings (MEH), which oversees UniSource\nEnergy's unregulated investments, reported a net loss of $3 million in the\nsecond quarter of 2004 after recording a net loss of $4 million in the same\nperiod last year.\n\nTUCSON ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY\n\nTEP reported second quarter earnings of $18 million, or $0.52 per UniSource\nEnergy share, compared with restated earnings of $14 million, or $0.40 per\nUniSource Energy share, in the same period last year. Retail kilowatt-hour (kWh)\nsales increased 5 percent in the second quarter of 2004 over the same period\nlast year.\n\nRetail revenues increased by $12 million compared with the second quarter of\n2003. TEP's retail customer base grew 2 percent to 370,894 between the second\nquarters of 2003 and 2004.\n\nHigher power prices and the increased availability of TEP's coal-fired\ngenerating facilities during the second quarter of 2004 led to a $7 million\nincrease in TEP's wholesale revenues compared to the same period last year.\nWholesale power prices on the Dow Jones Palo Verde Index averaged $44 per\nmegawatt-hour (MWh) during the second quarter of 2004, compared with $39 per MWh\nduring the second quarter of 2003. Energy output from TEP's coal-fired\ngenerating facilities increased 10% in the second quarter of 2004 over the same\nperiod last year.\n\nOther factors affecting TEP's earnings include a $4 million increase in\nTransition Recovery Asset amortization and a $3 million decline in total\ninterest expense resulting from lower rates under TEP's credit agreement and\nlower capital lease obligation balances compared with last year. TEP recorded a\n$3 million reserve in the second quarter of 2004 to further reduce the amount of\nits outstanding receivable related to wholesale sales made to California in 2001\nand 2000 that it believes are collectible. This amount was recorded as a\nreduction to wholesale revenue.\n\nUNISOURCE ENERGY SERVICES\n\nUES reported earnings of $0.5 million, or $0.02 per UniSource Energy share. The\nutility began providing gas and electric service through UNS Gas and UNS\nElectric in northern and southern Arizona in August 2003. During the second\nquarter of 2004, UNS Electric recorded retail revenues of $35 million, while UNS\nGas produced retail revenues of $21 million.\n\nCustomer growth at UES remains strong. Both UNS Gas' and UNS Electric's retail\ncustomer bases grew by over 1 percent during the second quarter of 2004.\n\n\n", u"\n\n\nMILLENNIUM ENERGY HOLDINGS\n\nMEH reported a net loss of $3 million, or $0.10 per UniSource Energy share,\ncompared with a loss of $4 million in the second quarter of 2003. Global Solar\nEnergy, a MEH subsidiary, lost $2 million during the second quarter of 2004,\ncompared with a loss of $4 million in the same period last year.\n\nYEAR-TO-DATE\n\nUniSource Energy's consolidated year-to-date earnings through June 30, 2004,\nwere $19 million, or $0.56 per share, compared to $59 million, or $1.75 per\nshare, during the same period last year as restated.\n\nLast year's results reflected the adoption of Financial Accounting Standard 143\n(FAS 143), a new rule related to accounting for plant retirement and removal\ncosts. TEP recorded a $67 million after-tax gain, or $2.00 per UniSource Energy\nshare, in the first quarter of 2003 as a result of adopting FAS 143. Excluding\nthe impact of FAS 143, UniSource Energy's consolidated year-to-date restated\nloss through June 2003 was $8 million, or $0.25 per share.\n\nQUARTERLY AND YEAR-TO-DATE EARNINGS PER SHARE SUMMARY\n\n", u'\n', u'\n                                                   2ND QUARTER\n                                               2004          2003\nPer UniSource Energy share                                (RESTATED)\n- ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n', u' ', u' ', u'\nTucson Electric Power                          $0.52         $0.40\nUniSource Energy Services (1)                   0.02            -\nMillenium Energy Holdings                      (0.10)        (0.13)\nInter-Company and Other                        (0.07)        (0.07)\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------\nUniSource Energy Consolidated                  $0.37         $0.20\n====================================================================\nAvg.
