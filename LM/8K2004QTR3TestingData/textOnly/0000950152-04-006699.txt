The adjustment impacts the income tax\nbenefit previously reported, as well as the net profit previously reported.\nThe adjustment does not change the Company\x92s previously reported pre-tax income\nor the amount of reported net operating loss carryforwards, or any tax asset or\nliability account.\n\n\n', u'With this change, the tax benefit from deductions attributable to the exercise\nof non-qualified stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive\nstock options are now reflected as a credit to additional paid-in capital\naccounts.\n\n\n', u'During fiscal 2004, $4.7\xa0million of such deductions generated a tax benefit of\n$1.9\xa0million. In the Company\x92s earlier press release, this $1.9\xa0million was\ntreated as a tax benefit in the income statement rather than a direct credit to\nthe additional paid-in capital account. As a result of the adjustment, the\nactual tax benefit to be reported in our income statement for fiscal 2004 will\nbe $16.0\xa0million, or $0.28 per fully diluted share, rather than the $17.8\nmillion and $0.31 per fully diluted share previously reported. In addition,\nthe actual net profit will be $29.9\xa0million, or $0.52 per fully diluted share,\nrather than the $31.8\xa0million or $0.55 per fully diluted share previously\nreported. In addition, as a result of the adjustment, our net income for the\nfourth quarter was $24.8\xa0million, or $0.43 per fully diluted share, including a\ntax benefit of $18.7\xa0million, rather than the previously reported net income of\n$26.7\xa0million, or $0.46 per fully diluted share, including a tax benefit of\n$20.6\xa0million.\n\n\n', u'The correction does not alter any of the Company\x92s previously announced\nguidance for fiscal 2005.\n\n\n\n', u'###\n\n\n', u'About Harris Interactive', u'\xae', u'\nHarris Interactive (www.harrisinteractive.com) is a worldwide market research\nand consulting firm best known for ', u'The Harris Poll', u'\xae, and for pioneering the\nInternet method to conduct scientifically accurate market research.\nHeadquartered in Rochester, New York, Harris Interactive combines proprietary\nmethodologies and technology with expertise in predictive, custom and strategic\nresearch.
