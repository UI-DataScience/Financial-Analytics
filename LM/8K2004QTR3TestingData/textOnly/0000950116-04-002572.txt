In\naddition, unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company had an interest\nsigned contracts of $79.1 million in the third quarter of FY 2004.\n\nRobert I. Toll, chairman and chief executive officer, stated: "Buyer appetite\nfor new luxury homes has remained tremendous throughout 2004 and we are enjoying\nvery strong demand across all our product lines. Therefore, we believe that FY\n2004 will be our twelfth consecutive year of record earnings.\n\n"Based on our current backlog, which affords revenue visibility over the next\nnine to twelve months, and the pace of current demand, we project FY 2005\ndeliveries of between 7,700 and 8,000 homes with an average delivered price in\nexcess of $600,000. Therefore, we believe we\'ll achieve at least 30% net income\ngrowth (25% earnings per share growth) in FY 2005. Based on our projections of\ncommunity growth in the coming year, assuming continuing strong demand, we\nbelieve that 20% revenue and net income growth should be achievable in FY 2006.\n\n"We continue to demonstrate our ability to grow dramatically in a very difficult\neconomy: Since 2000, despite an economic recession, dramatic job losses, a\nsevere stock market slump, and global political turmoil, we have doubled our\nrevenues and net income. While much of this can be attributed to the tremendous\nhard work of our associates, we also believe it reflects the strength of the\nluxury market, the brand name we have built, the growing number of affluent U.S.\nhouseholds and the industry\'s environment of greater stability and reduced\ncyclicality.\n\n"Geographic and product diversification, access to lower-cost capital, a\nversatile and abundant home mortgage market and improving demographics are\npromoting strong and steady demand across many price points for those builders\nwho can control land and persevere through the increasingly difficult regulatory\napproval process. This evolution in our industry favors the large, publicly\ntraded home building companies with the capital and expertise to control sites\nand gain market share. This helps explain the growth of many of the public home\nbuilding companies during these difficult economic times.\n\n                                     *more*\n', u'\n"Two recent studies, one from Harvard University and the other from the\nHomeownership Alliance, project that demand for new housing should range from\n1.85 million up to 2.17 million new single and multi-family units annually over\nthe next ten years. Yet our industry\'s average annual production peaked in the\n1970\'s at 1.77 million units and has never reached that sustained pace again\nbecause of increasing regulatory land approval constraints that restrict supply.\nIn this environment, we envision a growing shortage of home sites as demand\nincreases. In anticipation, we now control more than 61,000 home sites in\naffluent lot constrained urban and suburban markets. With this supply, we\nbelieve we are well positioned for continued growth in the coming years."\n\nToll Brothers\' financial highlights for the period ended July 31, 2004\n(unaudited):\n\no    FY 2004\'s third-quarter net income of $106.0 million ($1.31 per share\n     diluted) grew 56% versus FY 2003\'s third-quarter net income of $68.2\n     million ($0.90 per share diluted), the previous third-quarter record.
