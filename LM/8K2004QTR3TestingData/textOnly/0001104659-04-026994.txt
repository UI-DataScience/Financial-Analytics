At this time, everyone is in a listen-only mode.\nLater a question and answer session will be opened. Today\x92s call is being\nrecorded. Participating on the call today are Darl McBride, President and Chief\nExecutive Officer, and Bert Young, Chief Financial Officer. Each of you should\nhave a copy of the press release issued this afternoon containing our third\nquarter and year-to-date results for fiscal year 2004 which we will be\ndiscussing further in this call. I wish to point out to the participants on\ntoday\x92s conference call that the information provided during this call will\ninclude forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are made only\nas of the date of this conference call and we undertake no obligation to update\nor revise the projections of revenue or other forward-looking information\nwhether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. Our\nperformance is subject to significant risks and uncertainties known and unknown\nthat could cause our actual results to differ materially from those that may be\nanticipated by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties\nmay cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to\nbe materially different from any other projections or future results implied by\nthese forward-looking statements. In particular, our projections of fourth\nquarter revenue for 2004 contain revenue from our SCOsource licensing\ninitiative. This initiative and the underlying intellectual property are the\nsubject of litigation. The projection of the SCOsource revenue and expenses is\nparticularly difficult and subject to both known and unforeseen risks.\nAccordingly, you should not place undue reliance on projections of future\nrevenue and expenses and results or other forward-looking statements. For a\nfull discussion of these and other risks, please see our annual report on form\n10-k for the fiscal year ended October\xa031, 2003 and our quarterly reports\non form 10-Q for the first quarter ended January\xa031, 2004. The second\nquarter ended April\xa030, 2004 and other the filings we have made with the\nSEC, all of which are available at www.sco.com or on the SEC\x92s Edgar database.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Darl McBride, President and Chief\nExecutive Officer of the SCO Group, Inc.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Darl McBride, SCO Group - President & CEO', u'\n', u'Okay. Thanks a lot and thanks all of you for joining us on today\x92s call.\nI would like to start off by apologizing for the delay in getting started. We\nhad a couple of last minute details we had to take care of. I\x92m pleased to say\nthat the third quarter has been both an active and productive quarter for the\ncompany with greater detail to come we\x92ve accomplished and in many cases\nexceeded almost every bar we set for ourselves last quarter. Most visibly, we\nrestored profitability in our core Unix business and saw a nice uplift in\nSCOsource revenue. Additionally, we closed the BayStar transaction and put into\nplace a shareholder rights plan, designed to ensure that our shareholders realize\nfull value from their investment in the company. We believe accomplishing these\ntwo things will help stabilize our company\x92s shareholder structure going\nforward. In summary, the quarter can best be described as one where the company\nwas firing on all cylinders from improved performance in the Unix business to\nenhanced financial discipline and greater investment in our legal case. Before\nI turn the call over to Bert to review our third quarter financial results, I\x92d\nlike to point out that we remain steadfastly focused on driving a dual path of\nsuccess in both the marketplace and in the courtroom and we\x92ll take whatever\nsteps are necessary to ensure both. So now let\x92s turn the call over to Bert\nYoung, our CFO, for an overview of the company\x92s financial results.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Bert Young, SCO Group - CFO', u'\n', u'Okay, Darl, thanks. The company reported revenue at 11.2 million for the\nthird quarter fiscal year 2003 as opposed to 20.1 million for the comparable\nquarter the prior year. The net loss for the third quarter was 7.4 million\ncompared to income of 3.1 million reported in the comparable quarter the prior\nyear. Net income to common stockholders was 7.5 million or 38', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u" SEQ.=1,FOLIO='',FILE='C:\\JMS\\kyang\\04-10281-1\\task181805\\10281-1-mm.htm',USER='kyangb',CD='Sep  7 15:41 2004' ", u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'cents per diluted common share for the third quarter fiscal year 2004.\nIncluded in this net income, the common stockholders for the third quarter was\na contribution of capital of 15.5 million related to the repurchase and\nretirement of the remaining 40,000 shares of the company\x92s series-A1\nconvertible preferred stock in connection with BayStar. Revenue for the third\nquarter was derived from 678,000 in SCOsource licensing which represented a\nsignificant increase from revenue of 11,000 generated in the second quarter\nfiscal year 2004 and approximately 10.5 million from our Unix products and\nservices. Revenue for Unix products and services was split at 53 percent in the\nAmericas and 47 percent in the international group. As indicated in our press\nrelease, let me take a moment to reiterate that we\x92ve increased our operating\nperformance and restored profitability in our Unix business and generated\noperating income for the third quarter. The cost of revenue for the Unix\nbusiness was 1.7 million resulting in a cost margin or gross margin of 8.8\nmillion or 84 percent. Costs and expenses for selling, marketing, R&D, general\nadministrative and non-cash amortization totaled 8.5 million. As a management\nteam, we\x92re extremely pleased with the progress we\x92ve made in the business\ndespite a challenging operating environment. Revenue from our SCOsource\nposition relating to compliance licenses was 678,000 for the third quarter and\n709,000 year to date. This revenue was primarily from two sources including a\ntransaction that was completed in a prior quarter and a newly signed license\nagreement in the third quarter. Due to confidentiality reasons, we\x92re not\ndisclosing specific terms of either of these license agreements. As in previous\nquarters, we\x92re continuing to classify legal and professional fees and other\ncosts and expenses that relate to the enforcement of our intellectual property\nrights as costs of revenue. For the third quarter, these costs were 7.3 million\nwhich reflects an unusually busy but very productive quarter for the company in\nthe defense of its intellectual property. Operating costs for selling,\nmarketing, R&D support and general administrative totaled approximately.9\nmillion for SCOsource. And as I mentioned previously, in connection with the\nclosing of the BayStar transaction in the third quarter, the company recorded a\ncontribution of capital of 15.5 million which represents the difference in the\ncarrying value of the series A shares and the fair value of the 2.1 million\ncommon shares and $13 million of cash that we issued. This contribution of\ncapital classified as a dividend increased earnings to common stockholders in\nthe third quarter fiscal year 2004. For the first three quarters of fiscal year\n2004, the company reported a net loss to common stockholders of 9.7 million or\n67 cents for basic and diluted common share on year-to-date revenue of 32.7\nmillion. This was down from revenue of 55 million for the first three quarters\nof fiscal year 2003 and net income to common stockholders of 6.9 million or 47\ncents per diluted common share.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Switching gears from our operating results and moving to the subject of\nstreamlining costs and operations, let me say that we\x92re pleased but not fully\nsatisfied with our progress on this front. Continuing forward with our third\nquarter efforts, we then focused on bringing new levels of financial discipline\nto the company. In the fourth quarter, we will make additional adjustments in\nall of our operating functions on both the Unix and the SCOsource and we\nanticipate recording restructuring costs in quarter four related to these\nactions. We expect these adjustments will further increase the effectiveness of\nour company\x92s operations. Management is prepared to monitor closely the\ncompany\x92s cost structure to further ensure that the expense side is appropriate\nfor the level of business activity and to ensure success in our litigation efforts.\nTo that point, we\x92re pleased to have entered into a letter of intent with\nBoies, Schiller and Flexner to revise our fee agreement with them to limit the\noverall cash costs of the legal fees associated with our company\x92s litigation\nto a total of $31 million. Equally important the agreement also says that\nBoies, Schiller and Flexner has agreed to lead SCO\x92s efforts through the\nduration and completion of the pending litigation. In return for this new fee\nagreement, we\x92ve agreed to increase the contingency associated with any award\non a scaled or sliding basis from 20 to 33 percent depending on the overall\nsize of the award. We will release further details upon finalization of the\nagreement. This is obviously a big development for us with the 31 million cap\nin place it means the remaining capital we have can then be used for working\ncapital and financing our efforts in the business going forward.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Finally, looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect consolidated\nrevenue to be in the range of 10 to 12 million. As previously indicated,\nSCOsource revenue remains extremely difficult to predict including the timing\nand level of revenue in the near term or in any given quarter. Operating\nexpenses for the fourth quarter relating to our Unix products and services', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u" SEQ.=1,FOLIO='',FILE='C:\\JMS\\kyang\\04-10281-1\\task181805\\10281-1-mm.htm',USER='kyangb',CD='Sep  7 15:41 2004' ", u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'exclusive of any restructure charges that may be incurred are\nanticipated to slightly decline from the third quarter. Costs and expenses for\nthe fourth quarter for SCOsource including legal fees are expected to vary from\nquarter to quarter depending on the level of and activity surrounding our\nintellectual property claims and therefore are difficult to predict. The\ncompany will take the necessary steps to protect our valuable Unix intellectual\nproperty and aggressively pursue our legal claims. Finally, our cash and\navailable-for-sale securities were 43 million as of July\xa031, 2004 and we\nwill continue to pursue our Unix business goals, enforce our intellectual\nproperty rights and pursue our litigation. So Darl, I\x92ll turn the time back\nover to you.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Darl McBride, SCO Group - President & CEO', u'\n', u'Thanks for that update, Bert. The legal team has done a great job of\npreparing our cases and allowing the rest of the team to concentrate on running\nour business. I\x92d like to spend the remainder of the call addressing our\nbusiness performance and prospects. As you know by now, we are pleased with the\ncost adjustments we have made in our Unix business and its return to\nprofitability despite a challenging operating environment. Between Unix\nproducts and services, we provided additional support to more than 25 existing\ncustomers, some of the more notable customers would include companies like ADP,\nBell Communications, Kroger, McDonalds, Samsung, Telecom Italia, TJ Maxx and\nZales. These deals were primarily related to our UnixWare and Open Server\ntechnology. Importantly the third quarter saw the launch of a number of new\nUnix OS products. These include UnixWare 7.1.4 and Smallfoot embedded Unix.\nUnixWare 7.1.4 represents a major upgrade to the product line with the addition\nof web service capabilities, increased security and greater hardware support\nfrom industry-leading vendors such as Dell, HP, Intel, Acer, HCL, Fujitsu,\nSiemens and many others. Our Smallfoot embedded Unix brings the same\nreliability that\x92s found in our Unix operating systems to the point of sale,\ngaming and many other small device market. We also recently introduced SCO\nOffice Server 4.1. The company\x92s new email and collaboration product. The SCO\nOffice Server has seen marked interest in the marketplace. All of these\nproducts have been well received by our customer base and we believe that they\nwill provide some revenue opportunities in the coming quarters. On deck and on\ntrack for calendar Q1 2005 is a major upgrade to Open Server. This is a code\nname Legend. We provided many of the attendees at SCO Forum, our recent annual\nconference, with a sneak peek at many of the capabilities that will be added to\nthis new version of Open Server and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive.\nWe believe that the release of Legend will strengthen the overall ecosystem of\npartners, developers, customers and resellers that rely on Open Server and also\npresent SCO with opportunities to upgrade our current install base. While our\nrecent product releases have marked the largest across the board, group product\nenhancements from the company in several years, we are committed to a continued\ninvestment in our business towards delivering unique product solutions for our\ncustomers.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Now shifting gears from Unix to SCOsource, we\nare certainly pleased that the increased revenue and the business from the\nprior quarter though we would continue to caution that forecasting these\nrevenues is very difficult. On this, I\x92ll reiterate that we believe there is\nvalue in our Unix licensing business and that we are offering our customers and\npotential customers a value they must be made aware of. There is continued\ninterest in the licensing of our Unix technology and we believe that when our\nlegal claims are substantiated in a court of law that demand for this licensing\nbusiness will see an increase. Some end users have chosen not to wait for a\ncourt resolution and we\x92ve accommodated their requests to license our\nintellectual property now. On the topic of our litigation, the past quarter was\none of increased investment in our cases. While our legal costs came in higher\nthan previous quarters, we believe that this was money well spent and Bert\nmentioned we have a solution in terms of how we manage those costs going\nforward. In particular, our litigation against IBM is progressing as planned\nand we look forward to having our case heard before a jury in the U.S. District\nCourt starting in 14 months. In the meantime, we\x92re in the process of putting a\nplan in place that will help us to better manage our legal costs from quarter\nto quarter. At this point, we have our eye on two developments that we feel\nhave the potential to accelerate our SCOsource revenue growth. The first is any\naction by the court that suggests Novell copyrights are unfounded. Despite an increase\nin SCOsource revenues and the accrual of additional SCOsource customers, we\ncontinue to believe that Novell\x92s claims have greatly impacted our', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u" SEQ.=1,FOLIO='',FILE='C:\\JMS\\kyang\\04-10281-1\\task181805\\10281-1-mm.htm',USER='kyangb',CD='Sep  7 15:41 2004' ", u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'ability to realize traction in this business. When the Novell case is\nresolved, we believe this will help create a healthier SCOsource licensing\npipeline moving forward. The other development involves the risks, the Linux\ndevelopment process. A study was recently released by open source risk\nmanagement that claimed that Linux potentially infringes on 283 software\npatents and while SCO litigation hasn\x92t involved patents, it does give an\nindication regarding some of the problems that have existed for years with the\nLinux development process. SCO believes that this development process has also\nbeen responsible for the misappropriation of SCO\x92s intellectual property into\nLinux. We believe that upon a favorable court judgment, demand for SCO\x92s Unix\nlicensing business could increase. We believe the intellectual property is the\ncore of the technology company. We believe our intellectual property has been\ninfringed upon and we will vigorously defend our IP at every turn. If you\nfollowed our company closely, you\x92ve seen that we\x92re laser focused on this\nissue and have no intention of backing down.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Lastly, it is noted in my opening remarks we\nwere pleased to have closed on the BayStar Capital transaction and to have\nintroduced the shareholder rights plan. As Bert touched on the BayStar\ntransaction, I\x92ll briefly address the shareholder rights plan. On\nAugust\xa010, the Board approved a shareholder rights plan. At its simplest,\nthe plan is put in place to ensure SCO shareholders realize fair value from\ntheir investment in the company. The rights plan is designed to ensure that our\nstockholders realize the long-term value of their investment in the company and\nis similar to those adopted by over two-thirds of the Fortune 200. The plan\nwill not prevent a takeover attempt but should encourage anyone seeking to\nacquire the company to negotiate fair value directly with the Board of\nDirectors. It\x92s important to point out we have not introduced this plan in\nresponse to any specific interest in or offer made for the company. More than\ntwo-thirds of the Fortune 200 do have these plans in place and while this plan\nis recently put in, we believe that this will basically keep any outside offers\nor potential takeovers that are not in the best interest of the shareholders at\nbay.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'So in summary, we\x92ve accomplished a great deal\nof the goals we set before us during the last quarter. The company\x92s Unix\nbusiness achieved profitability and added to the company\x92s cash balance. We\nincreased SCOsource revenues. We\x92ve protected the company from an undervalue\nbid by implementing a shareholder rights plan. We\x92ve clarified our shareholder\nstructure by removing the rights and references associated with the BayStar\ndeal and have retired their preferred shares. We continue to deliver on our\nproduct development and marketing plans and we believe that we\x92ll provide new\nsales opportunities for the company in the future. And then last, but certainly\nnot least, we talked about the letter of intent we\x92ve entered into with Boies,\nSchiller and Flexner that will give us much more flexibility and sustaining\npower as the cases move forward. It also obviously demonstrates the belief that\nthey have in our case. our litigation is on tract and progressing as expected\nthrough the court system and with that we are fully funded to follow this\nthrough through its full conclusion. So I\x92ll now turn the call over to the\noperator and let\x92s open up the phone lines for questions.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Operator:', u'\n', u'Thank you, sir. If you would like to ask a question on today\x92s call, you\nmay do so by pressing star, one on your touchtone telephone. Again, that is\nstar, one to ask a question. If you\x92re on the speakerphone, please make sure\nyour mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment.\nOnce again, that is star one to ask a question. We\x92ll pause a moment to\nassemble our roster. Once again, that is star, one to ask a question. And we do\nask that you limit yourself to one question.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Questions and Answers', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Operator:', u'\n', u'And we\x92ll take our first question from Dion Cornett with Decatur Jones.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u" SEQ.=1,FOLIO='',FILE='C:\\JMS\\kyang\\04-10281-1\\task181805\\10281-1-mm.htm',USER='kyangb',CD='Sep  7 15:41 2004' ", u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Dion Cornett, Decatur Jones - Analyst', u'\n', u'Congrats on the sequential pickup in business.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Darl McBride, SCO Group - President & CEO', u'\n', u'Thanks, Dion.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Dion Cornett, Decatur Jones -\nAnalyst', u'\n', u'Just if I can sneak in two here that the first one has to do with the\nnegotiated fee settlement. Bert, can you give me an explanation. You report $43\nmillion in cash and securities, that $31 million cap, how is that counted\nagainst fees already paid and how does that relate to the roughly $8 million in\ndeferred legal comp your showing on the balance sheet?', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Bert Young, SCO Group - CFO', u'\n', u'Okay. So the 43 million in cash we that have, of that 31 million will be\nallocated towards this agreement. Some of that is for fees that we\x92ve already\nincurred. The majority of it will be over time over the next year and year,\nyear and a bit and we\x92re still flushing out all the details on it\x97so some of it\napplies to what we\x92ve already incurred, some of it will apply going forward.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Dion Cornett, Decatur Jones -\nAnalyst', u'\n', u'So the bottom line is no matter what happens in the courts, you will\nhave $12 million left over after legal expenses.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Bert Young, SCO Group - CFO', u'\n', u'Exactly.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Darl McBride, SCO Group - President & CEO', u'\n', u'Right.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Dion Cornett, Decatur Jones -\nAnalyst', u'\n', u'Okay. And then the next question may be a little bit tougher. A number\nof recent articles have come out where purportedly independent legal experts,\nand law firms have expressed uncertainty about your case. Could you describe\nwhat precautions you\x92ve taken to protect your shareholders from what could be\nperceived as bad legal advice?', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Darl McBride, SCO Group - President & CEO', u'\n', u'You\x92re talking about...', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Bert Young, SCO Group - CFO', u'\n', u'So you\x92re saying some experts think we don\x92t have a good case and I\nthink what we\x92ve done to protect ourselves is picked one of the best firms in\nthe country and top-notch litigators and professionals and...', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Darl McBride, SCO Group - President & CEO', u'\n', u'I think, Dionne, to take that on, I believe that if you look at the\nclaim that we have, we\x92re moving forward very nicely through the court system.\nAt every turn of the way, there are IBM-sponsored websites out there that claim\nthat the next claim is going to be the one that SCO\x92s going down. I mean,\nthey\x92ve been saying this for a year and the cases keep moving through. Like\nBert said, we retained one of America\x92s if not one of the world\x92s best\nlitigators. They have a lot of confidence in our cases and we look forward to\nhaving those cases tried in the courtrooms.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Dion Cornett, Decatur Jones -\nAnalyst', u'\n', u'Maybe I need to be a little bit more specific. I mean, attorneys from\nCar & Farrell, Gray, Cary, Ware and Freidenrich, Kirkpatrick, Holland,\nAllan, Tompkins and Cary, the list goes on and I don\x92t know what the\nreasoning\x97what purposes these people may have in common but these are all\nrespected law firms that have expressed skepticism, Judge Kimball and his last\nfinding used the word substantial doubt with respect to the transfer of\ncopyright.

There are multiple intellectual\nproperty law firms involved in this and these are good intellectual property\nlaw firms. So absolutely Boies has surrounded himself with a strong set of\nlegal talent as they\x92ve gone through these cases. Now with respect to our\ndetractors out there, I would come back and ask them the question, have they\nreviewed the material that is in front of the courts right now. I can guarantee\nyou they haven\x92t reviewed it all because many key pieces are under seal. As I\nsaid on my last call, there is a wide gap between what the judge and the two\nparties, between IBM and SCO are looking at, and what the world is currently\nseeing. As this gap is closed, we\x92re very confident about what the so-called\npundits will think about SCO\x92s case.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Dion Cornett, Decatur Jones -\nAnalyst', u'\n', u'Thank you and congrats again on the improvements in the core business.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Darl McBride, SCO Group - President & CEO', u'\n', u'Thanks, Dion.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Operator', u'\n', u'We\x92ll take our next question from Steven Vaughan-Nichols with eWeek.com.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Steven Vaughan-Nichols, eWeek.com -\nAnalyst', u'\n', u'Hi there. I have two relatively minor questions. Hopefully you can get\nthem both. The first is in regards to the shareholders rights plan, you said\nearlier that was not a response to any expected earning deals currently on the\ntable. Is this though in response to the past efforts by BayStar where BayStar\nclearly had a distinct idea that SCO should dedicate itself strictly to its intellectual\nproperty litigation and an attempt to ensure that a situation similar to the\nBayStar one which dragged out for months won\x92t happen again.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Darl McBride, SCO Group - President & CEO', u'\n', u'Yeah, clearly our position on this is that we\x92re just trying to make\nsure that shareholders realize fair value from their investment in the company\nthat the rights plan part is really designed to ensure that stockholders get\nthis long-term value and to make sure that someone isn\x92t able to come in with a\nless than friendly takeover attempt to put the company and the shareholders at\nrisk vis-\xe0-vis something that we would view to be a fair deal. So again, it\x92s\nnot directed at any particular camp per se but it is\x97the share price right\nnow\x97we are concerned about somebody that would try to be opportunistic and I\nget asked this question quite frequently, Steven, but what\x92s to keep IBM or\nwhat\x92s to keep some other company from coming in and taking you guys out at a\nmuch lower price than what you even have on your claims on the table. This will\nhelp deal with some of those issues.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Steven Vaughan-Nichols, eWeek.com -\nAnalyst', u'\n', u'Okay. My second question is considering your reorganization in the\nfourth quarter, are you all looking at layoffs? At reductions in force?', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Darl McBride, SCO Group - President & CEO', u'\n', u'Well, I mean, some of those things are always things we look at\nquarterly on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I think a majority of what we have in\nmind for quarter four has to do with office closings and downsizing of some\noffices both here in the U.S. and then primarily overseas.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Steven Vaughan-Nichols, eWeek.com -\nAnalyst', u'\n', u'Very good.

The 31 million that we\x92ll commit is from basically\nthis point going forward. In other words, it doesn\x92t totally take into account\nthat 15 million.

So the 8 million,\nthat\x92s the accrued compensation the law firms that\x92s on your balance sheet.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Bert Young, SCO Group \x97 CFO', u'\n', u'Correct.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u" SEQ.=1,FOLIO='',FILE='C:\\JMS\\kyang\\04-10281-1\\task181805\\10281-1-mm.htm',USER='kyangb',CD='Sep  7 15:41 2004' ", u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Larry Solomon - Capital Guardian\n- - Analyst', u'\n', u'So you have not paid it yet but you have been billed for it. So...', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Bert Young, SCO Group \x97 CFO', u'\n', u'Yeah. Right.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Larry Solomon - Capital Guardian\n- - Analyst', u'\n', u'I get it. Okay.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Bert Young, SCO Group \x97 CFO', u'\n', u'And so it leaves really 12 million in the business.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Larry Solomon - Capital Guardian\n- - Analyst', u'\n', u'Got it. And just another quick question. In terms of the legal action\nand the court responses so far, can you just sort of summarize the responses\nthat you\x92ve gotten back from the court that have been positive to your case?', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Darl McBride, SCO Group - President & CEO', u'\n', u'Sure, I\x92d be glad to do that. If you go look at\x97let\x92s take a summary of\nthe case. Let\x92s start with IBM going back. On April\xa019th I believe it was,\nthe judge came out\x97the magistrate in that case came out\x97I think it was\nMarch\xa06th, somewhere in that time frame\x97came out and ruled that SCO had\nshown good faith in its discovery process, in its claims process. We put some\nthings on the table, then ordered IBM to come out and deliver to us all of\nPalmisano and Ludowskiburger\x92s documents, emails, etc., as well as a bunch of\nother executives\x97an order for them to give us AIX and Dynix ordered a bunch of\ndifferent witnesses\x97there were a bunch of things that were in there\x97but that\nwas a very positive development, and on April\xa019th, we actually received\nsome very good information and we\x92ve been working through that. Now even though\nthe judge ordered delivery of all that material, IBM has still been significantly\ndeficient in meeting the judge\x92s order and that\x92s why you see motions back and\nforth right now that will be heard on September 14th and 15th in Utah with\nrespect to continued motions to compel to get them just live up to the judge\x92s\norders. But the order itself was very positive and the results of that order\nhave been positive for the company to date and we look forward to some more\ndiscover. In the Novell case, there was Novell had filed a Motion to Dismiss.\nThat case obviously was not dismissed. The case is moving on and now Novell has\nfiled another Motion to Dismiss so we look forward to hearing that. You know in\nthe Daimler case, you had a situation where we claimed that they had a\nresponsibility to certify their compliance with the Unix contract. After we\nsued them, they came back and certified. We continued the case because we\nwanted some other questions answered. The judge disagreed that we could go\nafter those additional questions but left open the possibility that we could go\nback after them for damages and various things with respect to having to sue\nthem to get them to certify. In the AutoZone case, the case was stayed but the\njudge came back and said you get 90 days of discovery to go in and figure out\nif you want to file a preliminary juncture. We\x92re going through that process\nright now. So again, there are a number of cases here in the various dockets\nbut there have been a number of positive developments for the hearings. Now if\nwe look at what\x92s coming up, everybody here on the call and otherwise should\ntune into the hearings that are going to be held on September\xa014th and the\n15th. The 14th is going to be as we said about motions to compel on discovery\nthat we show that we\x92re owed that they haven\x92t delivered to us. The 15th is\ngoing to be a hearing on a couple of things. One is on the IBM case regarding\none of their motions for partial summary judgment which we feel good about and\nthe other one is with respect to the next hearing on the Novell case. So we\nlook forward to those. We believe that in the IBM case that there are a lot of\nthings that you can go out there and read but the characterization that IBM is\ntrying to maneuver behind some legacy AT&T contracts is misguided and we\nthink that some of the things that they\x92ve tried to do in the courtroom is not\ngoing to work in terms of summary judgment motions. They have motions that are\ndirectly at odds with the plain language of the license agreements. They have\nanother motion that depends on the testimony of witnesses that in prior cases\nunder oath have given directly contradictory testimony on the very issue that\x92s\nat stake here in our cases and then we look forward to having those\ncontradictions brought up. So in another event, they\x92ve taken the fine print of\nthe contracts that we have, they\x92ve come out sorry to say, you can\x92t protect\nyour', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u" SEQ.=1,FOLIO='',FILE='C:\\JMS\\kyang\\04-10281-1\\task181805\\10281-1-mm.htm',USER='kyangb',CD='Sep  7 15:41 2004' ", u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'property unless it\x92s literal implementation. So in other words, they\x92re\ntrying to say the contracts that we\x92ve signed have less value than a typical\ncopyright violation. So there are a variety of things here that we feel very\npositive that when we get into a courtroom the things will be put on the table\nand our litigators feel confident about getting in and having those cases\nheard.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Operator', u'\n', u'Once again, that is star, one to ask a question. Again, if you are on a\nspeakerphone, please make sure your mute button is turned off to allow your\nsignal to reach our equipment. Once again, that is star, one for questions. And\nwe\x92ll take our next question from Stephen Shankland with CNET.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Stephen Shankland, CNET - Analyst', u'\n', u'Hi folks. I\x92m curious. On this cap payment arrangement with Boies,\nSchiller and Flexner, is it fair to say that you\x92re replacing cash payments\nwith contingency payments when you look at the sliding scale arrangement that\ngoes instead of from being 20 percent it\x92s a sliding scale between 20 and 33\nreally if that\x92s what you foresee it will be when it\x92s finalized. And also,\nwhat are the factors that go into where that shows up on that 20 to 33 percent?\nIs that just on the gross magnitude of some judgment or are there other factors\nin there as well?', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Bert Young, SCO Group \x97 CFO', u'\n', u'Yes, so let me address that. At a certain sense, you can think of it as\nreplacing cash with contingency although we\x92re still going to spend a lot of\nour cash and direct that cash resource to the cases. But you\x92re right. In a\ncertain sense, the long-term obligation that may exist there will be covered\nwith the contingency. The sliding nature of it will have to do with judgments\nand settlement amounts. So a different amount then would be the different\namounts that would be paid on the contingency. And as we finalize all these\ndetails, this will all be made public and we\x92ll have to file the definitive\nagreement as we conclude that here in the next few weeks.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Stephen Shankland, CNET - Analyst', u'\n', u'Okay. And then what\x97Darl, when you\x92re talking about the possibility for\na new investment that there are some people that are interested, what would\ntrigger that new investment? Is there some level of cash or expenses that would\ntrigger you to get interested in that as opposed to just give you that warm,\nhappy glow inside?', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Darl McBride, SCO Group - President & CEO', u'\n', u'Cash is all good, right? I think with the structuring that we have right\nnow where we\x92re throwing off positive cash on the Unix business and now we have\nthe costs contained on the litigation front, I think the triggering event for\nadditional capital would probably revolve around future growth prospects for\nthe company whether you\x92re going outside to look at additional products or acquisitions\nor what have you, whether you have an internal product that you wanted to try\nand take and run up the growth curve. So the core business is moving along,\nstable, throwing off cash, litigation business is now in control from a cost\nstandpoint. I think it would tie into some kind of growth initiative, but we\x92re\nnot saying that that\x92s what we\x92re here to announce right now but that if\nsomething came along that front, then we\x92d probably consider that.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Stephen Shankland, CNET - Analyst', u'\n', u'Thanks. And do you guys consider $7.9 million as sort of a high water\nmark for your monthly expenses on the SCOsource front?', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Darl McBride, SCO Group - President & CEO', u'\n', u'Yes, we do view that as a high water mark. The important thing going\nforward is the water mark is not going to be as significantly impactful on the\ncompany per se given that we have a partner in here to help manage the water\nlevel if you will.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n', u" SEQ.=1,FOLIO='',FILE='C:\\JMS\\kyang\\04-10281-1\\task181805\\10281-1-mm.htm',USER='kyangb',CD='Sep  7 15:41 2004' ", u'\n', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Stephen Shankland, CNET - Analyst', u'\n', u'Thank you.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Darl McBride, SCO Group - President & CEO', u'\n', u'Yes.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Operator', u'\n', u'And due to time constraints, this does conclude today\x92s question and\nanswer session. At this time, I\x92d like to turn the call over to Mr. Darl\nMcBride for any additional comments or closing remarks.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Darl McBride, SCO Group - President & CEO', u'\n', u'Bert, go ahead.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Bert Young, SCO Group \x97 CFO', u'\n', u'Yeah, let me just make one clarification when we were talking about\nrestructuring costs and downsizing of offices. Let me clarify that what we\x92re\ntalking about is primarily moving from larger offices into smaller offices. We\nare contemplating\x97not contemplating\x97we\x92ve announced a couple of smaller offices\nthat will close but in Europe, our office in Spain for example, our office in\nItaly\x97but our primary offices will continue and the real movement there will be\nfrom a large office costing a lot of money into a smaller office that costs a\nlot less. So I just wanted to clarify that.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Darl McBride, SCO Group - President & CEO', u'\n', u'Okay, great. So to summarize the call today, we\x92re very enthused about\nwhere we sit at this point. If you go back to the first call today, Dion asked\nan interesting question about where the public perception on this is, we\x92ve\ntaken the response as a management team that we can\x92t fight back against the\nboisterous nature of a lot of people that are trying to shout us down. What\nwe\x92ve tried to say is we\x92re not going to get into a shouting match. We\x92re not\ngoing to get into an industry brawl. We feel like the company has had\ninjustices done to it and we\x92ve taken those claims and put them in front of the\nappropriate courts. We look forward to getting those claims heard. We feel\nconfident in where those go. We give a few responses here on these calls only\nbecause there are a lot of investors who wanted to get some basic information.\nSo in response to a lot of IBM\x92s allies that do like to come in and weigh in\nagainst\x97get some basic remarks here, but other than that, we\x92re going to keep\nour arguments confined to the courtroom. Now with respect to those courtroom\narguments, I do invite you to stay tuned. I invite you to stay tuned and watch\nclosely the bouncing ball here inside of the courtroom over the coming weeks. I\nknow that we\x92re certainly looking forward to here as a management team. As we\nfinish this quarter then, this call. We feel like we\x92ve had a productive third\nquarter across all segments of our business. As we stated earlier, we\x92re\nlaser-focused on winning in the courtroom, on renovating our SCO Unix product\nline and on protecting the rights of our shareholders. Thanks for joining our\ncall today.', u'\n', u'\xa0', u'\n', u'Operator', u'\n', u'And this does conclude today\x92s conference call.
