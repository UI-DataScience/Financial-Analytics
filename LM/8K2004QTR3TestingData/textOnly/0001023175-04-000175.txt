Reports Record Revenues\n                        for Second Quarter\n\nSANTA MONICA, Calif., -- iMedia International. Inc. (Other OTC: IMNL.PK) is\npleased to report record revenues of $899,675 in the second quarter ended June\n30, 2004 compared to $102,120 during the second quarter of 2003, an increase\nof over 750%.  The increase in sales is indicative of the Company\'s increased\nability to procure new business and the shift in its sales emphasis towards\nspecial edition and custom disc production.  "We have focused much of our\nsales and marketing activities towards forming strategic partnerships with\npublishers of newspapers, magazines and various new corporate clients, the\nresults of which we feel will be realized within the next six months," states\nDavid MacEachern, Chairman and CEO of iMedia International, Inc.    He added,\n"in addition, we are increasing emphasis on marketing to the direct response\nindustry for new business."\n\nIn recent developments, iMedia:\n\n- -     Announced that its subsidiary, Hollywood Previews, released the 2004\n      Tribeca Film Festival Special issue of Hollywood Previews(TM)Magazine.\n\n- -     Was featured in the April 19th issue of Advertising Age Magazine, which\n      described iMedia\'s unique interactive disc media as "The cutting edge in\n      FSI (free standing inserts)."\n\n- -     Announced the successful distribution by Univision (NYSE:UVN - News) of\n      the iMedia produced CD-ROM "Hispanic Vote Tool Kit."\n\n- -     Signed an agreement with International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local\n      Union 495 to create a new messaging program aimed at improving\n      communications with Local members and attracting new members.\n\n- -     Announced an agreement with the Los Angeles Times to jointly market a\n      digitally enhanced supplement to Las Vegas hotels, casinos and other\n      prospective sponsors.\n\n- -     Announced an agreement to begin developing unique and innovative DVD and\n      CD-ROM based promotional discs for selected PRIMEDIA (NYSE:PRM - News)\n      publications and advertisers.\n\n- -     Announced the completion of the production and distribution of an\n      interactive promotional disc on behalf of FX Networks, LLC (a division\n      of FOX TV), for the hit series Nip/Tuck.\n\n- -     Announced an agreement to produce an interactive product iCatalog(TM)\n      for TELEBrands Corporation, one of the world\'s largest direct response\n      television advertising companies.\n\n- -     Announced the completion and distribution of its third interactive\n      promotional disc for FX Networks, LLC, to promote the new television\n      show "Rescue Me".\n\nCost of sales increased to $766,409 from $204,486 for the three months ended\nJune 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Gross profit contribution was $133,266\n(or 15%) and $5,089 (or 14%) for the three months ended June 30, 2004 and\n2003, respectively, an increase of 25 times.  [Cost of sales] for the\nquarterly period ending June 30, 2004 originated primarily from the design,\nproduction and distribution of custom discs and royalties.  Cost of sales from\nthe comparative prior year period included a combination of design and\nmanufacturing costs, thus there is little parity in comparisons between the\ntwo periods.\n\n\n', u'\n\nOperating expenses increased to $1,158,317 for the three months ended June 30,\n2004, from $641,234 for the same period in the prior year, an increase of\n113%.  The increase in expenses is due to continued development of products,\ngrowth initiatives, expenses associated with expanded sales efforts, as well\nas substantial legal and accounting costs associated with the maintenance of\niMedia\'s fully-reporting status.  Interest expense, relating to convertible\ndebt interest, increased to $95,044 for the three months ended June 30, 2004.\nBank interest of $511 was incurred for the same period in the prior year.\n\nNet loss for the three months ended June 30, 2004 increased to ($1,241,595)\ncompared to ($802,525) for the prior year\'s comparable period, an increase in\nnet loss of ($439,070) or (54%).    The increase in net loss is primarily\nattributable to the expanded operations, the substantial legal and accounting\ncosts related to our fully-reporting status, and our increased sales and\nmarketing efforts.\n\n"I am very excited about the continuing growth of our business and revenues.\nWe have seen a huge increase in business since we began focusing on the\nproduction of custom discs.  Revenue projections for Q3 and Q4 look very\nstrong, and our sales cycles continue to shorten" concluded David MacEachern.\n\nAbout iMedia International Inc.\n\niMedia International, Inc.
