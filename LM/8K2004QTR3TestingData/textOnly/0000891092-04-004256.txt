Net earnings for the quarter were\n$193,000, or $0.08 per diluted share, as compared to net earnings of $461,000,\nor $0.19 per diluted share, in the same quarter last year.  Net earnings for\nthe prior year were increased by $189,000, or $.08 per diluted share,\nassociated with the resolution during the quarter of an old disputed claim for\nlaboratory furniture.\n\n    Sales of laboratory products to industrial research customers slowed\nduring the quarter, as the number of opportunities in this marketplace\ndeclined and a number of announced projects were delayed.  The demand for\ntechnical products in the high-tech marketplace also softened further during\nthe quarter.  The educational marketplace for laboratory products remained\nfirm.  The order backlog at July 31, 2004 was $39.6 million.  This compares to\na backlog of $43.1 million at April 30, 2004 and  $50.7 million at July 31,\n2003.\n\n    Earnings for the quarter were unfavorably impacted by the lower sales and\nproduction volumes and significantly higher costs of steel, wood, and other\nraw materials, as well as higher energy costs.  The impact of these factors\nwas partially offset by lower manufacturing costs.\n\n    "The lower sales volumes, combined with higher costs for raw materials and\nenergy, resulted in a challenging, as well as disappointing, quarter," said\nWilliam A. Shumaker, President and Chief Executive Officer of Kewaunee.  "We\nare aggressively taking actions to reduce costs until our markets improve.\nThese include a recent significant workforce reduction in Statesville, tight\ncontrols over spending, and the implementation of a number of strategies to\nfurther reduce our costs.\n\n    "We are excited about a number of activities currently underway to\nincrease sales," Mr. Shumaker continued.  "We are pursuing sales opportunities\nfor our products in several new markets through potential strategic\npartnerships with well-established companies.  We have also increased our\nemphasis on opportunities in the rapidly-growing Asian laboratory research\nmarket."\n\n    Kewaunee Scientific Corporation is a recognized leader in the design,\nmanufacture, and installation of scientific and technical furniture.
