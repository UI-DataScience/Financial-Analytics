However, when compared to the first quarter ended April 30, 2004, the Company\x92s revenue went up by 180%. This is the first quarter in the last four successive quarters that the Company showed net revenue above one million dollars.', u'\n', u'\n', u'For the six months ended July 31, 2004, the Company reported today the total net revenue from its storage and security, adapter card, frame relay and service businesses of $1.4 million, compared with $4.8 million reported for the same period last year, a decrease of 69.7%.', u'\n', u'\n', u'For the six months ended July 31, 2004, the Company reported a net loss of $1.7 million, or a loss of $0.12 per share, compared to a net income of $0.3 million, or $0.02 per share, for the same period last year.', u'\n', u'\n', u'The financial results for the second quarter and the six months ended July 31, 2004, include the operations of Microtek Systems, Inc., which the Company acquired as of May 14, 2004.', u'\n', u'\n', u'The Company\x92s professed strategy focuses on acquisition opportunities that fit into its existing technologies with emphasis on storage markets, as well as commercializing its own line of products in storage area network transport. In addition, the Company continues its efforts to restore profitability to its Rixon Networks subsidiary through increased sales efforts and reduced overhead, and sustain its profitable Sync Research subsidiary. "The acquisition of Microtek is a leading and prime example of the implementation of our strategy.
