While touching nearly every end\nmarket and every continent, the largest momentum change was with our\ndistribution partners in North America.\n\n     "Based on conversations with major distribution and EMS customers\nin recent days, we continue to believe that this softness is a\ntemporary lull in what has now been many quarters of growth in the\nelectronics industry. In fact, KEMET revenue in the month of August\nwas better than the month of July, and we believe the month of\nSeptember will be higher than August. While conditions are improving,\nwe do not now believe that momentum in the electronics industry will\npick up sufficiently in September for us to achieve the revenue that\nwe had previously anticipated for the quarter.\n\n     "We now anticipate that KEMET revenue in the September quarter\nmay be down 10% to 13% compared to the June quarter.  We do not\nhave further guidance at this time on the impact that this may have on\nbottom line profitability or on what revenue growth may be in the\nDecember quarter, though we do expect business to improve in December\nover September.\n\n     "While the environment in the electronics industry is very\nchallenging at the moment, our senior team is focused on managing\nthrough this. Our restructuring efforts, announced over a year ago,\nare on schedule, and we are pleased with the efficiencies and\nproductivity improvements we are now seeing. I remain confident in\nKEMET\'s strong market position, based on our market leading reputation\nfor quality, delivery and service with the world\'s major electronics\nmanufacturers and distributors."\n\n     KEMET Corporation is a preferred supplier of standardized\ncomponents to the world\'s most demanding customers of quality,\ndelivery, and service.
