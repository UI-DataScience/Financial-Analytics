Aggregate sales, which include inventory sales plus consignment sales,\nrose 119% to $258.4 million in fiscal 2004 from $118.2 million in the previous\nfiscal year. Net income for the year was $29.4 million, or $1.14 per diluted\nshare, compared to $2.8 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, in fiscal 2003. Net\nincome in fiscal 2004 included a non-cash tax credit of $4.9 million resulting\nfrom a change in deferred tax valuation recognized in the fourth quarter.\nExcluding this tax credit, pro-forma net income in fiscal 2004 was $24.5\nmillion, or $0.95 per diluted share.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, revenue rose 103% to $60.7 million from $29.8 million in\nthe same period last year. Aggregate sales increased 120% to $75.4 from $34.2\nmillion in the fiscal 2003 fourth quarter. Net income in the quarter was $16.3\nmillion, or $0.57 per diluted share, compared to $2.1 million, or $0.17 per\ndiluted share. Net income in the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter included the\naforementioned tax credit of $4.9 million. Excluding this benefit, net income in\nthe 2004 fourth quarter was $11.4 million, or $0.39 per diluted share.\n\nGreg Manning, First Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said,\n"Our record financial performance in fiscal 2004 exceeded our expectations and\nreflects the strong demand in the philatelic and numismatic markets. In\naddition, during the year we completed several major acquisitions that we\nbelieve will complement our core competencies in the multibillion-dollar global\ncollectible market for rare coins and stamps. The Company expanded its global\npresence across the U.S., Europe and Asia this past year and currently operates\na total of 16 subsidiaries in six countries, plus Internet auctions. Our\nexclusive supplier agreements with Afinsa Bienes Tangibles, SA of Madrid, Spain,\nour majority shareholder, contributed approximately $102.2 million in\nnon-auction sales. Although the agreements do not specify a minimum level of\nsales, based on our sales to Afinsa over the past year, we estimate that the\ncontracts, which can be terminated by either party under certain circumstances,\nwill generate more than $1 billion in revenue to GMAI over the full ten-year\nterm of the agreements."\n\nManning continued, "Our rapid growth also reflects management\'s ability to\nexecute its strategic growth plan. In fiscal 2004, pretax profit climbed to\n$32.6 million from $3.0 million in fiscal 2003. In addition, gross profit grew\nto $61.5 million, or 28.9% of revenue, compared to $14.5 million, or 14.3% of\nrevenue, in fiscal 2003."\n\nEsteban Perez, Chairman of the Board, added, "We are confident in our ability to\nsustain strong internal growth as well as growth through additional\ncomplementary acquisitions. The successful platform we have built provides\nsubstantial growth opportunities that will enable management to drive future\nperformance and maximize shareholder returns."\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Greg Manning Auctions realized approximately $22.1\nmillion in aggregate sales through its coin and stamp companies located in North\nAmerica, Europe and Hong Kong as compared to $8.2 million in aggregate sales in\nthe same period last year. Pretax profit in the fourth quarter totaled $14.4\nmillion compared to $2.3 million in the same period last year and gross profit\nwas $23.6 million, or 38.9% of revenue, compared to $6.4 million, or 21.5% of\nrevenue.\n\nLarry Crawford, Chief Financial Officer, said, "Fiscal 2004 was a breakthrough\nyear for GMAI. In addition to record revenue, aggregate sales and net income,\nthe Company ended the year in the strongest financial position in its history.\nAs of June 30, the Company reported a cash position of $16.3 million and $48.4\nmillion in working capital.\n\n"We look forward to fiscal 2005 which will reflect a full year of operations\nfrom our recently acquired companies, including the renowned auction house of\nH.R. Harmer of New York, whose acquisition was completed on July 30, 2004. Our\nauction line-up for the first half of 2005 is our strongest ever for this\nperiod, with numerous live event sales already scheduled as well as a full line\nof Internet auctions. We also recognize the benefits of operating as a public\ncompany, which has manifest itself as a competitive advantage in securing\nbusiness with prospective consignors and those who prefer to sell their\ncollectibles for immediate payment. We intend to continue to enhance our overall\noperating leverage as we strengthen our presence in the global marketplace,\nparticularly in Europe and Asia. Finally, we believe we will solidify our\nposition as one of the leading collectible companies in the world as exemplified\nby our fiscal 2004 results and our excellent prospects for continued growth in\nfiscal 2005 and beyond."\n\nThe company will broadcast live via the Internet its fourth quarter and year-end\nconference call for fiscal 2004 today at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss\nfinancial results, business developments and future outlook.
