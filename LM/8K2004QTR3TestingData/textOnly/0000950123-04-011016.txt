Operating\nincome increased to $6,065,000 in fiscal 2004 from $2,225,000 in fiscal 2003.\nNet income for fiscal 2004 was $3,335,000, or $0.47 per fully diluted share as\ncompared to $1,010,000, or $0.14 per fully diluted share for fiscal 2003. Per\nshare calculations are based on 7,081,000 and 7,358,000 fully diluted weighted\naverage shares outstanding in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively, after\nadjusting for the 2-for-1 stock dividend effective April 2004.\n\nMr. Richard Soloway, Chairman and CEO, noted, "We are very pleased by the\nCompany\'s performance this fiscal year and particularly with the final quarter\nended June 30, 2004 as it is a testament to the concerted effort by our entire\norganization to increase sales and gross margins and improve efficiency. These\nresults are indicative of the potential strengths inherent in NAPCO\'s various\nlines of business. In our estimation, we are entering a new period of sustained\ngrowth buoyed by the world wide need for advanced security products and\nsolutions. The business opportunities ahead of us are very significant and could\nraise NAPCO to a significantly higher level of sales and profitability. My\nenthusiasm is bolstered by the outstanding growth in our higher margined\ncommercial, industrial, governmental and institutional products."\n\n Mr. Soloway added, "The earnings and earnings per share performance in the\ncurrent fiscal year were dramatically higher, exceeding the prior fiscal year by\nmore than three times. Furthermore, the improvement was not limited to the\nincome statement. Our already strong balance sheet has strengthened even more as\nover the past year we have reduced long term debt by almost $8 million to $8.3\nmillion and we reduced inventories by $2.3 million to $14.6 million.\n\n                                                                          -More-\n\n', u'\n\nNAPCO Fiscal 2004 Year End Results......./p.2\n\n"Our success has been derived from the strong acceptance of the broadest line of\nsecurity products in the marketplace and the loyalty of our extensive\ndistributor and dealer networks. We have committed over $4 million annually to\nresearch and development to assure that our security systems and solutions are\nworld-class. Among security professionals our products are considered to be the\nepitome of reliability, technology and ease of use. We are very proud of that!\nWe intend to continue to devote the necessary resources and dollars to maintain\nthis leadership position," Mr. Soloway declared.\n\n"We believe that NAPCO is poised for significant growth and we fully anticipate\nthat our fiscal first quarter ended September 30, 2004, historically the\nslowest, will be much improved this year. In addition, our contract\nmanufacturing activities, specifically with ADT, seem to be gaining traction and\ncould be a significant contributor to both top and bottom line results in the\nnear future," Mr. Soloway stated.\n\nMr. Soloway concluded, "Our shares have performed exceptionally well over the\npast year, rising from as low as $3.30 to the current price of nearly $9. We are\ncautiously optimistic that NAPCO can continue its strong performance in the\nfuture, leading to even greater shareholder value."\n\n\nThe NAPCO Security Systems, Inc. annual meeting is set for December 13, 2004,\nwith a record date of October 24, 2004.\n\n                      ------------------------------------\n\nNAPCO Security Systems, Inc. is one of the world\'s leading manufacturers of\ntechnologically advanced electronic security equipment including burglary and\nfire alarm systems, access control products and electronic locking devices.
