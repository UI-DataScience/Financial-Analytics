Ameron earned $.94 per diluted share on sales of\n$155.2 million in the third quarter of 2003.\n    As previously announced, two executive benefit plans were\nterminated in the third quarter of 2004, resulting in a nonrecurring\n$12.8 million pretax charge associated with the curtailment and\nsettlement of the plans. The after-tax impact of the curtailment and\nsettlement was $14.9 million due to restrictions on the deductibility\nof certain executive compensation. Additionally, 2003 third-quarter\npretax results included a $2.5 million gain on the sale of Ameron\'s\nminority interest in a Mexican coatings venture. Excluding the benefit\nplans\' termination costs in 2004 and the gain on the sale of the\nventure in 2003, Ameron would have earned $.72 per share in 2004\nversus $.74 per share in 2003.\n    "The third-quarter results were affected by the non-routine items\noutlined above, but we are pleased with the Company\'s core\noperations," commented James S. Marlen, Ameron\'s Chairman, President,\nand Chief Executive Officer. "Core operations were comparable in the\nthird quarter of 2004 and 2003. While both the Water Transmission and\nPerformance Coatings & Finishes Groups continued to be affected by\nweak market conditions, the Fiberglass-Composite Pipe and\nInfrastructure Products Groups performed well due to strong demand.\nAdditionally, profits and cash flow were significantly enhanced by the\nsuccess of TAMCO, Ameron\'s 50%-owned steel mini-mill."\n    For the first nine months of 2004, Ameron lost $.56 per diluted\nshare on sales of $435.6 million, compared to earning $2.19 per\ndiluted share on sales of $433.6 million in the same period in 2003.\nIn addition to the third-quarter performance highlighted above, the\nyear-to-date results were impacted by labor disputes at three of\nAmeron\'s major operations in the first half of 2004. Excluding the\nbenefit plan termination costs in 2004 and the gain on the sale of the\ncoatings venture in 2003, in the first nine months, Ameron would have\nearned $1.22 per share in 2004 and $1.98 per share in 2003.\n    The Fiberglass-Composite Pipe Group had flat sales and higher\nprofits in the third quarter. An increase in sales from Asian\noperations to Far Eastern marine and offshore markets was offset by\nlower sales from U.S. operations. Demand in the U.S. for piping for\noffshore applications was lower, and sales of oilfield piping also\ndeclined. Segment profits increased due primarily to lower selling,\ngeneral and administrative costs. Despite a slight falloff in certain\nmarkets, the overall demand for fiberglass piping remains robust. The\noutlook for the Fiberglass-Composite Pipe Group remains favorable.\nProgress is being made to construct a new state-of-the-art fiberglass\nproduction facility in Malaysia. The facility should begin production\nat the end of 2005.\n    The Water Transmission Group\'s sales and profits declined in the\nthird quarter of 2004, compared to the same period in 2003. Sales were\nlower as a result of the soft market conditions which persisted in the\nwestern U.S. throughout 2004. Profits declined primarily because of\nlower sales and increased competitive pressures. Based on the current\nbacklog of orders, improvement is expected in the fourth quarter.\nHowever, full-year results are not expected to meet those of last\nyear. Longer term, the outlook for the Water Transmission Group\nremains positive based on the needs for water piping in the western\nU.S.\n    The Performance Coatings & Finishes Group had higher sales, but\nlower profits. The Performance Coatings & Finishes Group continued to\nsuffer margin pressures and weak market conditions. Sales increased in\nEurope and Australasia, but sales declined in the U.S. Both U.S. and\nEuropean operations continued to struggle against weak demand for\nhigh-performance coatings used in chemical and industrial markets. The\nU.S. offshore market also remained weak, while the marine market was\nsolid. Improvement remains dependent on higher spending in U.S. and\nEuropean industrial markets.\n    The Infrastructure Products Group had higher sales and profits\nthan in the third quarter of 2003. Sales and profits of both pole\noperations and Hawaiian quarry and ready-mix operations improved due\nto continued residential and commercial construction spending\nthroughout the U.S. and Hawaii. Hawaiian operations returned to normal\nfollowing settlement of the labor dispute in the first half of the\nyear. The outlook for the Infrastructure Products Group remains\npositive.\n    TAMCO, which manufactures steel reinforcing bar for the\nconstruction market in the western U.S., continued to benefit from\nlocal demand and higher prices caused by the strong worldwide demand\nfor steel. TAMCO is forecasted to perform at record levels for the\nbalance of 2004.\n    Jim Marlen continued, "The Fiberglass-Composite Pipe Group and\nTAMCO are each operating at an outstanding pace, and the\nInfrastructure Products Group has recovered nicely from the Hawaiian\nlabor disputes. We expect improvements from the Water Transmission\nGroup in the fourth quarter. Our previous estimate of a solid second\nhalf from operations still holds."\n    As previously announced, the Company terminated the two executive\nbenefit programs in consideration of ongoing costs, anticipated\nlegislative restrictions on such programs, and the Company\'s\npreference for executive benefit plans having more predictable costs.\nAmeron previously purchased life insurance policies to cover benefits\nunder the plans. The cash surrender values of these policies totaled\napproximately $26.9 million as of August 29, 2004 and exceeded the\namount required to make lump-sum payments to all plan participants.\nDuring the third quarter ended August 29, 2004, $24.7 million was paid\nto participants to settle most of the obligations of the Company under\nthe plans. The settlement payments were made using existing cash\nbalances, and the life insurance policies continued to be held by the\nCompany for investment purposes and to reduce income taxes. Management\nanticipates that, going forward, a portion of the life insurance\npolicies will be liquidated and a portion of the policies will\ncontinue to be held for general investment purposes. Termination and\nsettlement of the plans is expected to reduce benefit expenses in\nfuture years, as well as reduce the approximately $2.7 million benefit\nexpense forecasted for fiscal 2004 by approximately $1.3 million.\nAmeron charged $2.1 million under the plans in fiscal 2003.\n    Management measures the Company\'s financial performance based on\noperating results without the impact of non-routine items, and\nbelieves that non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding the non-routine\nitems described above, provides a more meaningful comparison of\nyear-over-year operating results. Non-GAAP earnings and earnings per\nshare are calculated as follows:\n\n\n                            Three Months Ended     Nine Months Ended\n                           --------------------- ---------------------\n                           August 29, August 31, August 29, August 31,\n                             2004       2003       2004       2003\n                           ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------\n(In thousands, except\n share and per share data)\n\nNet (Loss) Income as\n Reported                    $(8,775)    $7,711    $(4,655)   $17,711\n\nPlus:  Pension Plan\n Curtailment/Settlement,\n Net of Taxes                 14,926          -     14,926          -\nLess: Gain on Sale of\n Amercoat Mexicana, Net of\n Taxes                             -     (1,675)         -     (1,675)\n                           ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------\n\nNon-GAAP Net Income           $6,151     $6,036    $10,271    $16,036\n                           ========== ========== ========== ==========\n\nWeighted Average Shares\n (Diluted)                 8,507,129  8,194,581  8,438,795  8,103,576\n\nNon-GAAP Earnings Per\n Share (Diluted)                $.72       $.74      $1.22      $1.98\n                           ========== ========== ========== ==========\n\n\n    Ameron International Corporation is a multinational manufacturer\nof highly-engineered products and materials for the chemical,\nindustrial, energy, transportation and infrastructure markets.
