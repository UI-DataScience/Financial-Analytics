Net income rose 39% to a record $2,757,000 on revenue of\n$7,562,000 compared to $1,984,000 on revenue of $5,718,000 last year.  On a\nper diluted share basis, net income was $.45 compared to $.33 last year.\nCash flow from operating activities (before changes in operating assets and\nliabilities) jumped 40% to $4,915,000.\n\nJames T. Huffman, President, said, "For the nine months, we established\nsignificant new records in most operational and financial categories,\nhighlighted by strong production growth and a 21% annualized return on\nequity without using leverage."\n\nFor the third quarter ended July 31, 2004, net income increased to a record\n$806,000.  Fully diluted per share earnings in both periods were $.13.\n\nHuffman further stated, "Fiscal 2004 drilling resulted in significant third\nquarter production growth.  However, third quarter results were suppressed\nprimarily because $429,000 was left-on-the-table due to hedging transactions."\n\n            PRODUCTION VOLUMES SET ANOTHER NEW RECORD\n\nNine-month production surged 30% to a record 1.48 Bfge (billion cubic feet\nof gas-equivalent) compared to 1.14 Bfge last year.  Natural gas production\nrose 29% to a record 1.28 Bcfg and oil production rose 27% to 32,900\nbarrels.  Natural gas accounts for 87% of the company\'s total production.\n\nThird quarter production rose 19% to 487 MMcfge (million cubic feet of\ngas-equivalent) compared to 408 MMcfge last year.  Natural gas production\nrose 17% to 417 MMcfg and oil production rose 36% to 11,700 barrels.\n\n              PRODUCT PRICES SHOW CONTINUED STRENGTH\n\nNet wellhead natural gas prices for the nine months rose 25% to $4.96 per\nMcf compared to $3.96 last year.  Hedging transactions reduced wellhead\nprices $.38 per Mcf in the nine-month period compared to a reduction of $.39\nper Mcf last year.  As a result, total natural gas price realizations rose\n5% to $4.58 per Mcf compared to $4.35 last year.  Wellhead oil prices rose\n18% to $32.66 per barrel compared to $27.65 last year.\n\nFor the third quarter, net wellhead natural gas prices rose 13% to $5.40 per\nMcf compared to $4.77 last year. Hedging transactions reduced wellhead\nprices $1.03 per Mcf this year and increased them by $.14 per Mcf last year.\n As a result, total natural gas price realizations fell 11% to $4.37 per Mcf\ncompared to $4.91 last year.  Wellhead oil prices rose 31% to $34.63 per\nbarrel compared to $26.41 last year.\n\nAt third quarter-end, the company had open hedge positions totaling 200\nMMcfg covering the months of September and October 2004 at an average NYMEX\nprice of $4.80 per Mcf.  Also at third quarter-end, the August hedge was\nclosed and a deferred loss of $112,000 was realized.  Subsequent to third\nquarter end, the September hedge was closed and a deferred loss of $31,000\nwas realized.  The only remaining hedge is for the month of October 2004.\nAverage gas prices in the company\'s market areas are expected to be 15% to\n17% below NYMEX prices due to basis differentials and transportation costs.\n\n                     RECORD CAPITAL SPENDING\n\nCapital spending for the nine months totaled a record $4,129,000 on the\ncompany\'s two core projects--natural gas drilling along the Anadarko Shelf\nof Oklahoma and application of the company\'s patented Calliope gas recovery\ntechnology.  A separate press release has been made today updating those\nresults.\n\n               STRONG FINANCIAL CONDITION PROVIDES\n                   SOLID FOUNDATION FOR GROWTH\n\n\nAt July 31, 2004, working capital was $6,942,000.  Total assets were\n$27,945,000 including cash and short-term investments of $7,417,000.\nStockholders\' equity was $20,200,000.  The company\'s only long-term debt is\na $355,000 exclusive license obligation that is payable over seven years.\n\n          *          *          *          *          *\n\nCREDO Petroleum Corporation is a publicly traded independent energy company\nheadquartered in Denver, Colorado.
