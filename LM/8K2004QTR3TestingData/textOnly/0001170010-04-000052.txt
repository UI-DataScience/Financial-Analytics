"Our used car business continued to experience widespread sales\n- ------\nvolatility and softness throughout the quarter," said Austin Ligon, president\nand chief executive officer. "We believe these effects are occurring broadly\nacross the late model used car market. We also believe current economic factors,\nsuch as higher gas prices, have contributed to the market environment. Newer\nmodel used cars also appear to be affected by the unusually intense and volatile\nincentive competition among new car manufacturers - particularly the domestic\nmanufacturers. The sales softness in the second quarter was exacerbated by the\nsevere weather experienced in Florida and the southeastern United States in\nAugust. Despite the sales softness, our best information indicates that we are\nmaintaining or gaining used car market share.\n\n"We posted strong new car comp sales increases, reflecting the strength of the\nprincipal brands we represent - DaimlerChrysler, Nissan, and Toyota," Ligon\ncontinued. "Total new car sales declined modestly, as the comp sales increases\nwere more than offset by the impact of having disposed of four new car\nfranchises since last year\'s first quarter." In accordance with our plan to\ndivest non-strategic new car franchises, during the second quarter CarMax\nreturned the rights to its Laurel Mitsubishi franchise to the manufacturer.\n\n"Wholesale sales continued to benefit from the steps we\'ve taken to improve our\n`buy rate,\' or the ratio of appraisal purchases completed to appraisal offers\nmade, and from higher wholesale prices," said Ligon. "Similar to the first\nquarter, enhanced systems support and a new, more consistent appraisal delivery\nprocess contributed to a year-over-year increase in our buy rate.\n\n"Other sales and revenues increased approximately 3%, as growth in our service\nrevenue was partially offset by a decrease in third-party finance fees," Ligon\nsaid. "In August, we rolled out Drive Financial Services, a new third-party\nfinance provider focused on subprime customers. As is customary in the subprime\nfinance industry, Drive purchases the loan contracts at a discount.\n\n                                     -more-\n', u'\n\nCarMax, Inc.\nPage 4 of 8\n\nThis discount is reflected in our income statement as an offset to the fees\nreceived from third-party providers lending to prime and nonprime customers."\n\nMargins. "Used car gross profit dollars per unit declined modestly compared with\n- --------\nthe second quarter of last year, reflecting the impact of the slower overall\nused car sales pace," said Ligon. "We adjust vehicle prices based on our\nproprietary inventory pricing model in order to maintain high inventory turns.\nHowever, during the first two months of the quarter, we maintained inventories\nat lower than original plan but higher than current sales rates. We did this in\norder to be able to take advantage of an upturn in sales during the peak sales\nmonths of the summer, if that were to occur. This reduced our turns and\npressured gross margin. However, in August we reduced our inventory levels, as\nis our practice. We target having our lowest inventory position of the year\nduring the week following Labor Day, in order to minimize the inherent inventory\nrisk associated with the new car model year changeover in the fall. Despite the\nsoft used car sales trends, we were successful in reducing inventories to target\nlevels at August 31."\n\nThe lower margin on other sales and revenues resulted primarily from lower\nservice margin and the inclusion of the Drive discount in third-party finance\nfee revenue.\n\nCarMax Auto Finance. "As expected, CAF income was lower than last year," said\n- --------------------\nLigon. "The CAF gain as a percent of loans sold was 3.9% in this year\'s second\nquarter, which is in line with our expectations for a normalized gain spread,\ncompared with 4.8% in last year\'s second quarter. The decline in the gain spread\nreflects the change in the underlying interest rate environment, with funding\ncosts having risen faster than consumer rates. For the balance of the year, we\nexpect that CAF gain spreads will be at the lower end of the 3.5% to 4.5%\nnormalized range."\n\nSG&A Ratio. "Our second quarter SG&A ratio increased to 10.2% in this year\'s\n- -----------\nsecond quarter compared with a 9.8% ratio in last year\'s second quarter," said\nLigon. "The higher ratio resulted from the deleveraging associated with negative\nused unit comps."\n\nThird Quarter Expectations\n- --------------------------\n\n  o      Comparable store used unit performance: A range of -8% to -2%.\n\n  o      Earnings per share: A range of 12 cents to 17 cents.\n\n"The third quarter, which coincides with the new car model year changeover\nperiod, is typically both our lowest volume period seasonally and our most\ndifficult quarter to predict," said Ligon. "The continuing sales volatility and\nweakness combined with the normally challenging model year changeover period\nmakes forecasting especially difficult. This year\'s hurricane season isn\'t\nhelping. While we are encouraged by our sales in the beginning of September -\nexcluding the weather-affected Southeast markets - our estimates for the quarter\nassume that market conditions remain volatile."\n\n                                     -more-\n', u"\n\nCarMax, Inc.\nPage 5 of 8\n\nConference Call Information\n- ---------------------------\n\nCarMax will host a conference call for investors at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time\ntoday, September 20, 2004.
