(August 26, 2004)-- Kirkland\'s, Inc. (NASDAQ/NM: KIRK) today\nreported financial results for the 13-week and 26-week periods ended July 31,\n2004.\n\n         Net sales for the 13 weeks ended July 31, 2004, increased 7.3% to $84.7\nmillion from $79.0 million for the 13 weeks ended August 2, 2003. Comparable\nstore sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 decreased 3.4% compared with a\n0.9% decrease for the second quarter of fiscal 2003. The Company reported a net\nloss of $2.7 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the second quarter of\nfiscal 2004 compared with net income of $764,000, or $0.04 per diluted share for\nthe second quarter of fiscal 2003.\n\n         Net sales for the 26 weeks ended July 31, 2004, increased 9.8% to\n$167.3 million from $152.4 million for the 26 weeks ended August 2, 2003.\nComparable store sales for the first half of 2004 decreased 1.0% compared with a\n1.9% increase in the prior-year period. The Company reported a net loss of $1.8\nmillion, or $0.09 per diluted share, for the first half of 2004 compared with\nnet income of $1.9 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the prior-year\nperiod.\n\n         Robert E. Alderson, Kirkland\'s President and Chief Executive Officer,\nsaid, "Our final results for the quarter were in line with the revised\nexpectations we issued in July. Consistent with trends that began in late April,\nthe second quarter was characterized by weak customer traffic and lower\ntransaction volumes compared with a year ago. Such results point to the need for\nnew ideas and initiatives in merchandising and marketing. Recent additions to\nour merchandising and marketing teams, along with our search for a senior\nmerchandising executive, are significant and positive steps in that direction.\nEfforts are already underway to improve buying and planning practices and to\nprovide a more focused merchandise offering. We also will communicate more\nfrequently with our customers, as we seek to renew the excitement and enthusiasm\nthat has long made Kirkland\'s a favored destination for stylish home decor at\ngreat prices."\n\nThird Quarter and Fiscal 2004 Outlook\n\n         The Company issued guidance for the third quarter ending October 30,\n2004, of a net loss of $0.10 to a net loss of $0.15 per diluted share, compared\nwith earnings of $0.10 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Net sales are\nexpected to be $82 million to $86 million, with a comparable store sales\ndecrease of 10% to 15% compared with an increase of 2.7% in the prior-year\nperiod.\n\n\n                                     -MORE-\n\n           805 N. Parkway - Jackson, Tennessee 38305 - (731) 668-2444\n\n', u'\nKIRK Reports Second Quarter Results\nPage 2\nAugust 26, 2004\n\n\n         Based on its third quarter guidance and current business outlook, the\nCompany now expects to report earnings for fiscal 2004 in a range of $0.45 to\n$0.55 per diluted share and net sales of approximately $395 million to $405\nmillion. Comparable store sales are estimated to be down 2% to 5% when compared\nwith the prior year. The Company\'s fiscal 2004 estimate includes 50 to 55 new\nstore openings and 10 to 15 store closings as well as the collective impact of\ntransition costs relating to the Company\'s new distribution center and the\nimplementation of a wide-area network linking the Company\'s stores and corporate\nheadquarters.\n\n         Mr. Alderson commented, "Sales thus far in August have slowed\nconsiderably in comparison to the trends we experienced in the second quarter.\nCustomer traffic remains a concern, particularly in our mall stores, and our\ncurrent inventory mix does not position us well against strong merchandise\nevents that we ran during last year\'s third quarter. Accordingly, we are not\noptimistic that we can produce positive comparable store sales in the near term.\nOn a more positive note, our aggressive markdown stance during June and July has\nleft our inventories in good shape, and the real estate team has kept our\ndevelopment plan on track for a net increase of 40 stores during fiscal 2004.\n\n         "Our merchandising, marketing, store operations and logistics teams are\ncommitted to reversing these business trends as rapidly as possible and\nimproving the productivity of our new distribution center to optimally support\nour stores for the fourth quarter. While we hope to accomplish much over the\nnext several months, it is difficult to definitively predict at this point when\nwe will see tangible results. We have therefore adopted a cautious outlook for\nthe balance of the year.\n\n         "Looking ahead to fiscal 2005, Kirkland\'s continues to be a sound\nconcept with tremendous growth potential. We are confident in our real estate\nstrategy, and we expect significant benefits from the modernization of our\nsupply chain and other initiatives to address the inconsistent sales and margin\nresults that have characterized our business for the past 18 months."\n\nInvestor Conference Call and Web Simulcast\n\n         Kirkland\'s will conduct a conference call on August 26, 2004, at 10:00\na.m. EDT to discuss the second quarter earnings release and other Company\ndevelopments, including the outlook for fiscal 2004.
