In the fourth quarter of 2003, a portion of the valuation allowance was reversed, resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax asset and related nonrecurring non-cash tax benefit of $1.7 million, resulting in an overall income tax benefit of $1.3 million.

As a result of an internal review of the process by\nwhich the Company's Domestic Services unit maintained its accrual for the costs\nof purchased transportation, the Company determined that it had understated its\naccrued purchased transportation liability and related costs of purchased\ntransportation. The amount of the under accrual is estimated to be in the range\nof $4.0-$6.0 million for 2003 and in the range of $500,000 to $1.0 million for\nthe first six months of 2004. After giving effect for these estimated\nincremental expenses, the Company's reported EBITDA would be reduced to the\nrange of $2.6-$4.6 million for 2003 and reduced to the range of\n$200,000-$700,000 for the first six months of 2004.\n\nReconciliations of the EBITDA amounts contained in this press release to the\nmost directly comparable GAAP amounts are included at the end of this press\nrelease.\n\nIn using its legacy operating system, to be replaced by Tech-Logis later this\nyear, Domestic Services relied on trend analysis to estimate its costs of\npurchased transportation. In reviewing the process by which Domestic Services\nmaintained the accrual for its costs of purchased transportation, the Company\nhas concluded that the process did not accurately account for the differences\nbetween the estimates and the actual freight costs incurred. This allowed for\nthe accumulation of previously unidentified costs of purchased transportation\nand an under reported liability for the accrued costs of purchased\ntransportation.\n\n\n\n", u'\n\nThe Company has discussed this issue with its recently engaged external\nauditors, Grant Thornton LLP. It has also advised its previous auditors, KPMG\nLLP which had audited the Company\'s financial statements for 2003. The Company\nis in the process of preparing an amended report on Form 10-K/A for 2003 and\namended reports on Form 10-Q/A for the first and second quarters of this year.\n\nThe anticipated restatement of operating results for 2003 and 2004 is not\nexpected to have an impact on the Company\'s cash position and will not affect\nStonepath\'s ability to provide the high-quality logistics services its customers\nhave come to expect.\n\nThe Company is also reviewing its financial guidance. In addition, the Company\nis assessing what, if any, impact these events will have on the Company\'s\nability to comply with its certification process with respect to the\neffectiveness of its internal controls and procedures for financial reporting\nrequired pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in connection\nwith the filing of the Company\'s 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe Company has also communicated these events to its bank and expects to\ncontinue to enjoy significant availability under its existing credit facility\nsubject to waivers of certain financial covenants which the Company expects to\nsecure.\n\nDennis L. Pelino, Chairman and CEO, commented: "We have identified this problem\nand we believe we understand the issues. Now we must make significant changes in\nour organization to address these issues and ensure that nothing like this ever\nhappens again. To strengthen our operations and begin streamlining the\nmanagement reporting structure, we have made several key management changes.\nJason Totah, the CEO of our international operations, will also become the CEO\nat Domestic Services as of September 27, 2004. This move will put all of our\nlogistics operations under one proven leader who will oversee the functional and\noperational integration of the divisions as we roll out Tech-Logis in the U.S.\nby end of the year."\n\nMr. Pelino added: "The Company has also restructured its financial organization\nto have the senior financial staff of its Domestic Services and International\nServices operations report directly to Bohn Crain, the Company\'s Executive Vice\nPresident and Chief Financial Officer. The Company also intends to add a senior\naccounting officer to reside in Minneapolis to provide technical support and\noversight to the financial reporting and accounting staff of the Company\'s\nDomestic Services and International Services operations and to interface with\nthe Company\'s corporate staff in Philadelphia."\n\n\n\n\n', u'\n\nPelino continued: "On the positive side, the earn-out methodology we use to\neffect our acquisitions provides the Company with the ultimate back-stop in this\nsituation. The incremental purchased transportation expense identified through\nour review process reduces the earn-out distributions that should have been paid\nto the former owners. As a result of this earn-out mechanism, the cash impact of\nthese adjustments should ultimately be borne directly by the former owners of\nthe businesses we have acquired rather than the Company itself."\n\n"Our Executive Committee, which I co-chair with Bohn Crain, has been working\nwell since its establishment in May, and is beginning to have a very positive\nimpact on how we will be structured as a Company going forward."\n\nPelino closed, "We are very confident in our future, and feel strongly that we\nhave our hands around the accounting issues that have slowed us down, putting us\non track for a solid 2005 and beyond."\n\nThe Company believes that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization, or EBITDA, is a useful financial measure of our financial\nperformance for investors. Under GAAP, our net income reflects the amortization\nof intangible assets arising from the Company\'s past acquisitions and other\nnon-cash charges. However, we believe that we are actually growing the value of\nour intangible assets through our acquisition strategy. Management of the\nCompany believes that EBITDA is a useful measure because it eliminates the\neffect of these non-cash costs and provides an important metric of the economic\nreality of the business. The following is a reconciliation of the projected\nEBITDA information contained in this press release to the most comparable\nprojected GAAP amounts.\n\nIn accordance with SEC Regulation S-K, a reconciliation of EBITDA estimates for\n2003 and for the first six months of 2004 (as adjusted for the purchased\ntransportation accrual) to the most directly comparable GAAP measure follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n                                                                                              (amounts in millions)\n                                                                                                             (First 6 Months)\n                                                                                           2003E                  2004E\n                                                                                           -----                  -----\n         ', u' ', u' ', u'\n         Net income/(loss)                                                                $1.1-3.1            ($1.6)-($1.1)\n         Interest expense/(income)                                                           0.1                    0.1\n         Income tax expense/(benefit)*                                                      (1.3)                  (0.2)\n         Depreciation and amortization                                                       2.7                    1.9\n                                                                                             ---                    ---\n         EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization)          $2.6-4.6               $0.2-0.7\n                                                                                          ========               ========\n', u"\n         * Prior to the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company maintained a\n         valuation allowance to offset 100% of the net deferred tax assets\n         associated with the tax losses generated prior to the Company's move\n         into the logistics business. In the fourth quarter of 2003, a portion\n         of the valuation allowance was reversed, resulting in the recognition\n         of a deferred tax asset and related nonrecurring non-cash tax benefit\n         of $1.7 million, resulting in an overall income tax benefit of $1.3\n         million. For purposes of developing its preliminary estimate of the\n         impact of the adjustment for the purchased transportation accrual, the\n         Company has not tax affected the adjustment and has assumed that the\n         adjustment would not impact the Company's basis for reversing a portion\n         of its valuation allowance.\n\n\nInvestor Conference Call\n- ------------------------\n\nStonepath Group will host a conference call for shareholders and the investing\ncommunity on Tuesday, September 21, 2004 at 11:00am, ET to discuss the contents\nof the release.
