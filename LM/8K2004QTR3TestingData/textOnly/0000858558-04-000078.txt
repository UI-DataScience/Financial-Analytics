(NYSE: RDA) today announced it has finalized the treatment of its\naccounting for magazine promotion costs.  As announced in its Fiscal 2004\nearnings release on July 29, 2004, because of changes and new initiatives in\nthe business the company will begin expensing magazine direct-response\npromotion costs as incurred, effective July 1, 2004; previously it had\ndeferred and amortized certain magazine promotion costs.  The company\nundertook a pre-clearance process with the Securities and Exchange Commission\nas it relates to the treatment of the existing deferred balance.  The company\nhas determined that, in connection with these changes, it will record a\none-time, non-cash charge of $(27) million, or $(0.17) per share, as of June\n30, 2004, and amortize the remaining balance of $77 million during Fiscal\n2005 to account for its existing promotion asset of $104 million.\n\n      After reflecting the $(27) million charge, the company reported\nfull-year Fiscal 2004 earnings of $0.49 per share.  Since the charge and the\nfuture amortization of the remaining deferred magazine promotion asset are\nnon-cash, this does not affect the company's cash flows.  Details of the\ncompany's results reflecting this charge and change to expensing magazine\npromotion costs as incurred will be included in its Fiscal 2004 Form 10-K\nfiling.\n\n     In Fiscal 2005, the effect of these changes will result in:  (1)\nexpense timing differences between quarters with no change in full-year\nprojected expense, and (2) non-cash charges of $77 million to amortize the\nremaining balance.  In its July 29 conference call, the company gave EPS\nguidance in the range of $0.77 to $0.87, excluding any restructuring charges,\none-time items and the resolution of the treatment of its existing deferred\nbalance.  The table below outlines, quarter by quarter, the anticipated\nearnings per share impact on timing and amortization of the remaining\nbalance.  A detailed explanation will be included in the company's quarterly\nfilings.\n\n", u'\n\n(Loss) Earnings per Diluted Share        Qtr 1     Qtr 2     Qtr 3    Qtr 4   Full Year\n\n', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u' ', u'\n     Effect of expensing versus         $(0.05)   $(0.06)   $ 0.05   $ 0.06    $  --\n   capitalizing magazine promotion\n   costs (timing)\n\n     Amortization of remaining          $(0.16)   $(0.17)   $(0.08)  $(0.08)   $(0.49)\n   deferred magazine promotion asset\n', u'\n\n\n      The Reader\'s Digest Association, Inc.
