During the 2004 fiscal fourth quarter,  total revenues  increased\nto  approximately  $6.2  million  compared to $0.8  million for the third fiscal\nquarter of 2004. Other highlights for the fiscal fourth quarter include:\n\no    Increased revenues from the intellectual property program to more than $5.5\n     million\n\no    Realized the first major intellectual property license since the initiation\n     of litigation\n\no    Grew NetSimplicity software revenues by 35% over the third fiscal quarter\n\no    Achieved a 29% decline in operating expenses over the prior quarter\n\no    Improved cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to approximately\n     $21.5 million\n\n"We are continuing to make progress with the overall  performance of the company\nand particularly  the  intellectual  property program where we granted the first\nsignificant  license  since  we  initiated  litigation,"  said  Richard  Snyder,\nchairman and CEO of Forgent.  "In addition,  the software business  continues to\nimprove and with the  addition of new  products and  marketing  initiatives,  we\nexpect  that  trend  to  continue.  Currently,  we are  focusing  on  increasing\nshareholder  value through our intellectual  property  program,  and growing the\nsoftware business."\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nThe intellectual  property program revenues were  approximately $5.5 million for\nthe fourth  quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to $0.3 million for the fiscal third\nquarter of 2004,  as a result of  licensing  Forgent\'s  still-image  compression\ntechnology, embodied in U.S. Patent No. 4,698,672 (`672 Patent). As an evolution\nof the company\'s  intellectual  property program,  Forgent initiated  litigation\nagainst 42 companies  for  infringement  of the `672 Patent in the United States\nDistrict  Court  for  the  Eastern   District  of  Texas,   Marshall   Division.\nSubsequently,   two  companies  have  been  dismissed  as  defendants  from  the\nlitigation as a result of reaching final agreements.\n\nSince  its  inception,   the   intellectual   property   program  has  generated\napproximately  $95  million  from  licensing  the `672  Patent  to more  than 30\ndifferent  companies  in Asia,  Europe and the United  States.  The `672  Patent\nrelates to digital  image  compression,  and fields of use  include  any digital\nstill  image  device  used to  compress,  store,  manipulate,  print or transmit\ndigital  still  images such as digital  cameras,  personal  digital  assistants,\ncellular telephones,  printers, scanners, and certain software applications. The\ncompany\'s patent portfolio includes the combined inventions of Compression Labs,\nInc., VTEL Corporation, and Forgent Networks, Inc.\n\nSoftware\n\nNetSimplicity software revenues grew by approximately 35% for the fourth quarter\nof fiscal 2004 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2004. NetSimplicity,  now\nwith more than 1,000 customers worldwide, provides low-cost, high-value business\napplications to small and medium businesses and divisions of large  enterprises.\nNetSimplicity\'s  flagship  product,  Meeting Room Manager,  enables customers to\nschedule conference rooms, catering and other resources with a few clicks of the\nmouse, thereby increasing  productivity and reducing costs. In addition,  NetSim\n\n', u"\n\nsells other high-value business applications,  such as IT asset management,  via\nits same low-cost e-marketing and telesales model.\n\nFiscal Fourth Quarter Results\n\nRevenue increased to $6.2 million for the fiscal fourth quarter compared to $0.8\nmillion for the 2004 fiscal third quarter,  reflecting a meaningful  increase in\nintellectual  property licensing revenues over the prior quarter.  Gross margins\nimproved to $3.2 million for the fiscal fourth quarter  compared to $0.4 million\nfor the 2004 fiscal third quarter.  Overall  expenses  declined by approximately\n29% to $3.5 million  compared to $4.9 million for the 2004 fiscal third  quarter\nas part of a  continuing  effort to  reduce  operating  expenses.  Net loss from\ncontinuing  operations was $0.2 million or $0.01 per share for the fourth fiscal\nquarter of 2004  compared  to a net loss of $4.4  million or $0.18 per share for\nthe  third  fiscal  quarter  of 2004.  Cash,  cash  equivalents  and  short-term\ninvestments were approximately $21.5 million.\n\nOutlook\n\nForgent has continued efforts to license the `672 Patent and expects to continue\nto  generate  license  revenues in the 2005 fiscal  year.  As a result,  Forgent\nanticipates additional IP licensing revenues during the pendency of the recently\nfiled  patent  litigation.  However,  predicting  the timing and amounts will be\ncomplicated because of the uncertainty of licensing  negotiations and due to the\npending litigation. Forgent believes that NetSimplicity software revenue for the\nfirst fiscal quarter of 2005 will grow.\n\nConference Call and Webcast\n\nForgent has scheduled a conference  call with the investment  community for Fri,\nSep.  17,  2004,  at 10:00 a.m.  CT (11:00  a.m.  ET) to discuss the quarter and\noutlook.\n\nTo participate, dial 800-591-6945 ten minutes before the conference call begins,\nask for  the  Forgent  event,  and use a pass  code of  30093130.

Forgent's  conference call.\nBefore  we  start,  I'd like to  mention  that  some of the  statements  made by\nmanagement  during  this call might  include  projections,  estimates  and other\nforward-looking  information.  This would  include other  information  about the\nCompany's outlook.\n\nThese  particular  forward-looking  statements and all those statements that are\nmade on this call that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks\nand  uncertainties  that could affect our outcome.  You are urged to considerate\nthe risk  factors  relating to the  company's  business  contained in our latest\nperiodic reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

It\ncannot be recorded or rebroadcast without the Company's express permission,  and\nyour  participation  implies  consent  to  the  call's  recording.  After  we've\ncompleted our review of the quarter, we will open the call up for questions from\nthe financial analyst  community.  I'd like to now turn the call over to Richard\nSnyder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Forgent. Richard?\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRichard Snyder  - Forgent - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks,  Michael. Good morning and thank you for attending Forgent's 2004 fiscal\nfourth  quarter  conference  call.  With me this morning are a few people that I\nwill introduce:  Jay Peterson, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jamie\nStevens who is our Chief Adviser on intellectual property, and Nancy Harris, the\nGeneral Manager of our NetSimplicity  software division.  As customary for these\ncalls,  I will  comment on our  results,  and have Jay give you some  additional\ndetails around the numbers, and then we will open it up for questions.\n\nThe major theme last  quarter  was to take  specific  action to improve  overall\nperformance  of the  Company.  I believe  we made some  solid  progress,  and it\nbrought us further  clarity to those areas of the  business we will  continue to\ndrive to do even better.\n\nAs you know,  we have two  business  segments  and I'd like to  comment on both.\nFirst,  intellectual property licensing,  and second, the NetSimplicity software\nbusiness. Okay, on IP. We see steady progress in this program, and that makes us\noptimistic  about the  future.  It's very  important  at this  stage to take the\nnecessary  steps  to  ensure  that  the  lawsuits  that  we have  filed  will be\nsuccessful, so that we can recover in full measure from those who are infringing\non our '672 compression patent.\n\nWe are also continuing every effort to reach  agreements  outside of litigation,\nand we were  successful  with two  defendants and are continuing the dialog with\nmany others,  who see the benefit of coming  forward early to settle with us and\nto be dismissed  from this lawsuit.  On this evidence,  we are  optimistic  that\nother defendants and other companies yet to be named in the lawsuit might choose\nto license the patent.  Those recoveries can obviously provide  significant cash\nto our company.\n\nTo keep you informed, we have also added additional links to our website to give\nvisibility to the details of the various court filings that are relevant to this\nlawsuit.  We remain  confident about the process,  and we have not seen anything\nfrom the defendants that would change our plans.\n\nOur NetSimplicity  software division grew over 35% last quarter, and is on track\nto  break  even by the end of this  year.  This is a  healthy  and  attractively\ngrowing  business  with  significant  margins.  We  believe  NetSimplicity  will\ncontinue to grow as we bring on new products and  promotions,  as well as expand\nthe distribution,  particularly on an international  front. We now have partners\nin the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia.\n\nWe have a small  amount of  ALLIANCE  activity  remaining,  that is  focused  on\nsupporting  existing  customers  through  paid  maintenance  contracts.  We have\nstopped the investment in ALLIANCE, and we now have two or three employees where\nthere were once 40 or 50. We are continuing to seek  alternatives for partnering\nand  have  spoken  to  several  companies  who have  expressed  an  interest  in\npurchasing the code. In the meantime,  we have a responsibility to our customers\nand we will, of course, honor those commitments.\n\nWe also  continue  to seek  other  ways to  return  shareholder  value.  We have\nrepurchased  shares when appropriate,  and consider other strategies as well. If\nwe were able to prevail in our IT litigation, we believe there will be even more\noptions available in the future.  Perhaps as a special dividend or even a tender\noffer.  But let me caution you:  These  lawsuits can be lengthy and that puts us\nsome time away from that goal.\n\nOn another note, we have been asked by some of our long-term  shareholders about\nthe potential of  acquisition  activity.  This is an option,  but let me be very\nclear.  We would only proceed with a  transaction  that would  produce cash very\nearly,  and provide a significant  growth  engine for the future.  It would also\nneed to be a good fit to our areas of understanding and technology.  We continue\nto look very  carefully for a strategic,  public or private  business or product\nline to  acquire  or  partner,  that  has  growth,  profitability,  and is of an\nappropriate  size.  We have already  considered  several  options,  and were not\nsatisfied with the fit to the criteria that we have outlined.\n\nLastly,  I want to  discuss  other  patent  activity.  Several  months  ago,  we\nannounced  Baker Botts was going to assist us with some other patents we have in\nour portfolio.  Unfortunately, Baker Botts was not able to continue, due to some\nunforeseen conflicts.  These patents represent many products in diverse markets,\nand those conflicts were not readily apparent at the outset.  However, they have\nbeen working  closely with us to assist us in moving those  patents to a new law\nfirm, along with the work they were already able to accomplish.\n\nWe are seeking alternatives, including bringing on perhaps, new firms to help us\nwith the IP program, as well as other strategies,  such as brokering, or perhaps\neven selling some of these patents. We will keep you apprised of the progress of\nthis activity as it goes along.\n\nSo in  summary,  Number  1, we remain  very  optimistic  about the  intellectual\nproperty program, and the litigation process to date. NetSimplicity continues to\ngrow rapidly and provide a solid margin base, and from a corporate  perspective,\nwe will continue to drive down expenses and overhead,  preserve or grow cash and\nlook for ways of returning shareholder value through a variety of means.\n\nNow I'm going to turn it over to Jay for some specific financial results.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJay Peterson  - Forgent - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank  you,  Dick.  First let me talk  about  the  revenue  performance  for the\nquarter.  Total  revenue  increased  significantly  during the  quarter,  due to\nimproved  intellectual  property  revenues  and  software  revenues.  Let me now\ndiscuss those two segments for you in greater detail.\n\nAs I mentioned  last quarter,  we noticed that our  negotiations  with potential\nlicensees  were not  productive,  resulting in declining  intellectual  property\nrevenues. In April, and then again in August, we initiated litigation against 42\ncompanies  regarding the '672 patent.  During this last quarter,  we realized an\nincrease in revenue and settled with one of the defendants in the case.\n\nSubsequent  to the end of the fourth  fiscal  quarter,  we settled  with another\ndefendant,  and we are  currently  in  discussions  with  other  defendants  and\nnondefendants regarding licensing agreements.  Regarding litigation,  we believe\nthat the  process is on track,  and we have not  learned of any new  information\nthat would negatively impact our position.\n\nTotal  software  revenues  for the quarter grew by 20%, led by a 35% increase in\nNetSimplicity  revenues.  Note that both  NetSimplicity  units and ASPs, average\nselling  prices,  grew this past quarter.  We are also seeing positive trends in\ncertain  verticals,  including  legal,  education,  healthcare,  financial,  and\npharmaceuticals. ALLIANCE revenues were essentially flat with the prior quarter.\nNote that these ALLIANCE  revenues are maintenance  contracts related to support\nof existing customers, and are not from new software license sales.\n\nLet me briefly discuss gross margins. Margins for intellectual property business\nthis last quarter were 50%, with one half of the proceeds going to our law firm,\nJenkens and Gilchrist, as part of the existing success fee arrangement with that\nfirm.  Our  software  business  generated  margins  of 69%,  an  increase  of 18\npercentage points over the previous quarter.\n\nLet me now discuss operating expenses. Consistent with previous guidance, our\ntotal operating expenses decreased significantly. This last quarter, we reduced\nSG&A expenses, R&D expenses, and Other infrastructure costs by a total of 29%.\nAlso, we have moved the majority of our development efforts to our NetSimplicity\noffice in Vancouver, where we realize lower operating costs. Note that we are\nplanning additional overall spending reductions for this quarter while\nmaintaining our investment in our software business, and also increasing\nspending in our IP segment.\n\nOur headcount as of today is 32 full-time employees,  down from 44 at the end of\nApril,  and 103 at the end of  January.  In terms of the  income  statement,  we\nsignificantly  narrowed the loss for the quarter to $200,000, or approximately 1\ncent per share loss, nearly getting to breakeven.  As you can calculate, we need\nonly approximately  $5.5 million to $6 million in intellectual  property license\nrevenue per quarter to be profitable.  And that is without growing software from\nits current revenue base, or by further reducing expenses.\n\nIn terms of our balance sheet,  our balance sheet remains strong.  At the end of\nJuly,  we were able to grow cash by  $400,000,  approximately  $.02 a share,  to\n$21.5  million  dollars,   including  the  cash  impact  of  a  modest  security\nrepurchase.  Working  capital was over $18.6 million,  an  improvement  over the\nprior quarter by approximately a half a million dollars. Also, our current ratio\nimproved to 6:1, a slight improvement over the prior quarter's 5.7.\n\nLet me switch to guidance, please. First off, we will achieve IP license revenue\nthis  current  quarter,  and  again,  while  predicting  the exact  timing of IP\nrevenues remains  difficult,  we are forecasting  intellectual  property revenue\nthroughout the next fiscal year. We anticipate that we will reduce our operating\nexpenses again, and this quarter we anticipate that reduction to be in the range\nof 10% to approximately 3.2 million.\n\nWe believe  that the  NetSimplicity  business  will  continue to grow,  and will\ngenerate cash in the second or third fiscal quarter of this current year. We are\nforecasting  this business to be profitable later this year, and we believe that\nwe will have to invest an additional one half million  dollars in cash over that\nperiod, for NetSimplicity to achieve profitability.\n\nLast  point,  we are  forecasting  our cash  balances  to remain  healthy and to\nmaintain  strong  working  capital.  I would  now like to turn the call  over to\nMichael Noonan.\n\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMichael Noonan  - Forgent - Director of Investor Relations\n\nWell, thanks,  gentlemen. And with that, I'd like to open up the meeting for Q&A\nfrom the analysts. And I'll ask Andrea to coordinate the session.\n\n\n\nQUESTION AND ANSWER\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this is the question-and-answer  session. If you'd like to\nask a  question  or  make a  comment,  please  key  star  followed  by 1 on your\ntouch-tone  phone.  Questions will be taken in the order that they are received.\nAgain, star 1 for questions.  Our first question comes from Carter Mansbach from\nConcord Equity Group, please proceed.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCarter Mansbach  - The Concord Equity Group - Analyst\n\nGood morning, fellows.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRichard Snyder  - Forgent - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood morning, Carter.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCarter Mansbach  - The Concord Equity Group - Analyst\n\nI have two questions,  one regarding the Dwork and Maxwell case, where these two\nattorneys who originally were on the case are suing Jenkens regarding  Forgent's\nlawsuits.  There were statements in there quite  intriguing,  one being the fact\nthat the JPEG patent  could bring  hundreds of millions of dollars to the bottom\nline for  Jenkens,  which I guess in turn would be the same for you. My question\nis,  do you  agree  with  that  statement?  And what are  your  feelings  on it?\nSecondly,  in the way of Adobe,  and the 5.5 million that was settled,  could we\nexpect the 42 companies  that are  currently  being sued,  the 5.5 million is an\naverage,  is it a low number, is it a high number?  Where does that fit into the\nwhole realm of it? I want to know if Adobe,  5.5 million is the average  that we\nshould look for, in the companies that the company is going after.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRichard Snyder  - Forgent - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer\n\nLet me comment on the first part, the Dwork and Maxwell case.  Obviously this is\nan issue  between  two former  employees  at  Jenkens,  and it is not  something\nrelative to Forgent,  per se. We find that the information  that is in that case\nis also  interesting.  We think that,  you know,  their  estimates are certainly\nvalid within the context of what we know about the IP business, and I think, you\nknow, I think they  obviously  have a right to their opinion as well. So I think\nthat's really all I can comment with regard to that part of the case. Jay, would\nyou like to comment on the second part of that question?\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJay Peterson  - Forgent - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nSure, Dick. Thanks for the easy question,  Carter.  Let me tell you what we know\nin terms of what's  actually  happened  over the program.  We have had some very\nsignificant  licenses from companies that we call tier one companies,  and we've\nhad some smaller  license from what we call tier 2, tier 3 and tier 4. If I take\nthe average of the 30-odd  licensees thus far, it's around 3.25 million  dollars\nper license.  We've got about 40 people  we're in  litigation  with,  and as you\nrecall,  there are many people,  other than the current  litigants  that we have\neither noticed or are currently in discussions with.\n\nIn terms of looking forward,  I think we will see some very large companies that\nwe will possibly license tier 1, and we will see, again, tier 2, tier 3 and tier\n4. How the average  changes over time and in the future,  it's very difficult to\npredict, Carter.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCarter Mansbach  - The Concord Equity Group - Analyst\n\nCan I just ask you,  would tier 1 be considered a Sony, 20 million plus? And are\nthere many,  like,  can you give me a number of how many tier 1 companies  there\nare?\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJay Peterson  - Forgent - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nSony would  definitely have been a tier 1. There are more than a handful of tier\n1 going forward.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCarter Mansbach  - The Concord Equity Group - Analyst\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator\n\nOur next  question is from  Michael  James from  Keukenhof  Capital  Management.\nPlease proceed.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMichael James  - Keukenhof Capital Management - Analyst\n\nFor the past few years the company  burned through in excess of $25 million with\nthe ALLIANCE  software.  During such time  management  has received  bonuses and\nstock option grants.  In the past I've raised questions about  management's high\ncompensation  and  inability to enhance  shareholder  value.  What is being done\nabout your compensation?  Why do you think NetSimplicity will be profitable when\nyou never achieved the forecast for ALLIANCE?  And why do you think that you can\nbe successful with an acquisition when your history shows that you have not been\nable to? Thank you.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRichard Snyder  - Forgent - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer\n\nIs that one question or --\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMichael James  - Keukenhof Capital Management - Analyst\n\nIt's actually three big questions.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRichard Snyder  - Forgent - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer\n\nOkay,  fine, I'll be happy to start with that. With regard to  compensation,  we\nuse the standard  methods within the industry to find  competitiveness  with our\npay ranges. We have not paid any incentive  compensation  through the last year,\ndue to the  financial  condition  of the  company,  nor  have  pay  raises  been\nimplemented.  So there has been no  movement in  compensation,  which I think is\nappropriate as the company reforms and goes through this process.\n\nNumber 2, the reason that NetSimplicity is successful, is being successful,  and\nis not the same as ALLIANCE,  it's a totally different business model.  ALLIANCE\nwas a enterprise  software  play,  which  required a high degree of direct sales\ncontent.  It was also a very high ASP of around  200,000 to 300,000 at  minimum,\nand  NetSimplicity  is a very small,  simple business  package that's focused at\nsmall and  medium-sized  businesses in more the $2,000 to $3,000  range.  And is\nreally scoped at an entirely different audience.\n\nThird, with regard to an acquisition, as I stated, we are being very cautious as\nwe  look  forward  to  what  might  be   appropriate  in  terms  of  growth  and\nprofitability.  And acquisitions in the past have been more speculatively  done.\nWe will  make  sure  that  that is to a  minimum.  But if we are going to find a\ngrowth engine to replace our intellectual property as that declines over time, I\nthink it's important for us to find a business that will be complimentary and to\nadd to the  business  mix.  I  believe  that  that's  consistent  with  what our\nshareholders would want to do.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJay Peterson  - Forgent - Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nAnd thank you for the question.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator\n\nLadies and  gentlemen,  this  concludes  your  question-and-answer  portion  for\ntoday's call. I would now like to turn the  presentation  back to Michael Noonan\nfor closing remarks.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMichael Noonan  - Forgent - Director of Investor Relations\n\nWell, thanks very much. And we appreciate everybody's  participation.  Just as a\nreminder,  Forgent is going to be at the Merriman Curhan Ford Investor Summit in\nSan Francisco next Monday and Tuesday,  if you're attending the conference or in\nthe Bay area, we hope to see you there.  Thank you again for listening,  we look\nforward to speaking with you soon. Good-bye for now.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen,  thank you for your  participation in today's  conference.\nThis concludes your presentation.
