As a result, the operations of Nexus Custom\n    Electronics are classified as discontinued as of July 1, 2003 (the\n    beginning of Jaco\'s 2004 fiscal year).\n\n     Commenting on the results, Jaco\'s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,\nJoel Girsky, stated, "We achieved an 11% rise in net sales during the fiscal\n2004 fourth quarter and a strong improvement in gross margins during the period.\nThe fiscal fourth quarter gross profit margins reflect both favorable market\nconditions and a higher margin product mix. During fiscal 2004, sales from our\ncore semiconductor offerings represented approximately 53% of Jaco\'s net sales\nwhile flat panel display (FPD) sales grew from 10% of total net sales in fiscal\n2003, to 21% in fiscal 2004. Our FPD sales rose over 150% in fiscal 2004 to\n$51.8 million.\n     "In anticipation of the continued explosive growth of our FPD unit, we\naccelerated the sale of our non-core contract manufacturing subsidiary, Nexus\nCustom Electronics, announced last week. Under the sale agreement, we remain a\nkey electronic components supplier to Nexus for a minimum five-year period. Of\nequal importance, we received $9.25 million of sales proceeds in cash with $2.75\nmillion scheduled and yet to be received, as well as an extra $1 million\nearn-out provision. With these sales proceeds, we will initially pay down our\nbank line, which was already reduced by $1.9 million from the level at the end\nof our fiscal third quarter.\n     "We continue to enhance our ability to design, integrate and customize\nunique flat panel displays for a broad range of industries and applications\nincluding electronic voting machines, the gaming and transportation industries,\nand touch-screen applications for the fast food industry. We plan to vertically\nintegrate our FPD capabilities and will start construction shortly on an\nin-house, state-of-the-art, 20,000 square foot FPD operation. When completed, we\nwill offer customers a one-stop source for their FPD supply and integration\nneeds. We believe the \'value-add\' component of our FPD operation, which includes\ndesign, engineering and integration capabilities, is a competitive advantage,\nand we intend to leverage both our broad line card and in-depth experience to\nexpand Jaco\'s market share.\n     "Looking ahead, we plan to accelerate our investment in the Far East, and\nmay explore distribution-related acquisitions in that region that meet our\ndisciplined criteria. With the Nexus divestiture, Jaco is now a pure-play,\nvertically integrated designer and distributor of FPD products and a distributor\nof a wide range of electronic components with a broad national presence and\nexpanding international capabilities. We remain focused on bottom-line results\nand the realization of the full potential from our focused operating base."\n     Jaco is a leading distributor of electronic components to industrial OEMs\nand contract manufacturers. Jaco distributes products such as semiconductors,\ncapacitors, resistors, electromechanical devices, flat panel displays and power\nsupplies, which are used in the manufacture and assembly of electronic products,\nincluding: telecommunications equipment, computers and office equipment, medical\ndevices and instrumentation, industrial equipment and controls,\nmilitary/aerospace systems and automotive and consumer electronics.\n     Jaco has two distribution centers and 16 strategically located sales\noffices throughout the United States. Jaco provides a variety of value-added\nservices including automated inventory management services, assembling stock\nitems for customers into pre-packaged kits, integrating and assembling various\ncustom components with flat panel displays to customer specifications. The\nCompany\'s core customer base consists primarily of small and medium-sized\nmanufacturers that produce electronic equipment used in a wide variety of\nindustries.\n\n     "Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act\nof 1995: This press release provides historical information and includes\nforward-looking statements that are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and\nuncertainties, including, but not limited to, our dependence on a limited number\nof distributors for our products, that most of our distributor agreements are\ncancelable upon short notice, the impact of downturns in our industry and the\ngeneral economy, the market for our products is very competitive, the impact of\ndisruptions in air or sea transportation and possible future legislative or\nregulatory changes on our business, volatility in electronic components\' pricing\nmay reduce our profit margins, the level of costs or difficulties incurred in\nconnection with integrating the operations of businesses we acquire, the\nfinancial strength of our customers and suppliers, and other risks disclosed\nfrom time to time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
