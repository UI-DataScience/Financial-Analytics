As a result of the firefighting\nefforts of the Mine Safety and Health Administration, the Kentucky Department of\nMines and Minerals, and Webster County Coal personnel, Dotiki successfully\nextinguished the fire and totally isolated the affected area of the mine behind\npermanent barriers. Initial production resumed on March 8, 2004. As previously\nadvised, Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. (the "Partnership") has commercial\nproperty insurance that provides coverage for damage to property destroyed,\ninterruption of business operations, including profit recovery, and expenditures\nincurred to minimize the period and total cost of disruption to operations.\n\n         On September 10, 2004, the Partnership filed a third and final proof of\nloss with the applicable insurance underwriters reflecting a settlement (the\n"Settlement") of all expenses, losses and claims incurred by Webster County Coal\nand other affiliates arising from or in connection with the Dotiki Fire Incident\n(the "Insurance Claim") in the aggregate amount of $27.0 million, inclusive of a\n$1.0 million self-retention, a $2.5 million deductible (collectively, the\n"Insurance Deductibles") and 10% co-insurance (the "Co-Insurance"). The\nInsurance Deductibles and Co-Insurance have been allocated on a pro-rata basis\nto each of the three areas of insurance recoveries discussed below. Previously,\nWebster County Coal had received two partial advance payments of $4.5 million\nand $3.6 million, respectively, net of the Insurance Deductibles and\nCo-Insurance. The accounting for these two net partial advance payments in the\naggregate amount of $8.1 million and the final net payment of $13.05 million,\nexclusive of the Insurance Deductible and Co-Insurance, are subject to the\naccounting methodology described below. Specifically, the Partnership has\nevaluated and accounted for the insurance recoveries in the following areas:\n\n         1.       Expenses incurred as a result of the fire - The Partnership\n                  incurred extra expenses, expediting expenses, and other costs\n                  associated with extinguishing the fire in an aggregate amount\n                  of approximately $7.1 million. With application of $5.6\n                  million of the insurance recovery proceeds, the Partnership\n                  has recorded net expenses of approximately $1.5 million.\n\n         2.       Damage to Dotiki mine property - The Partnership incurred\n                  damage to Dotiki\'s mine property (exclusive of any amounts\n                  relating to matters discussed in 1. above) of approximately\n                  $1.2 million, which property had a net book value of\n\n\n\n                                       2\n', u"\n\n                  $138,000. This net book amount was written off in the first\n                  quarter of 2004, and a corresponding amount was recorded in\n                  the first quarter of 2004 as an estimated insurance recovery.\n                  Based on discussions with the underwriters culminating in the\n                  Settlement, the Partnership will also record a net gain of\n                  approximately $785,000, reflecting the amount that the\n                  allocated insurance proceeds will exceed the net book value of\n                  the damaged property.\n\n         3.       Dotiki mine business interruption costs and extra expense -\n                  Based on the negotiations with the underwriters leading to the\n                  Settlement, the Partnership has recorded a net gain of\n                  approximately $14.4 million for the recovery of business\n                  interruption costs and extra expenses stemming from the Dotiki\n                  Fire Incident.\n\n         Pursuant to the accounting methodology described above, the Partnership\n(a) has recorded, as an offset to operating expenses, approximately $2.9\nmillion, $0.2 million, and $2.8 million, during the first, second, and third\nquarters of 2004, respectively, and (b) in the third quarter of 2004, has\nrecorded a combined net gain of approximately $15.2 million for damage to\nproperty destroyed, interruption of business operations (including profit\nrecovery), and extra expenses incurred to minimize the period and total cost of\ndisruption to operations.\n\n         On September 13, 2004, the Partnership announced via press release the\nfinal settlement of the Insurance Claim.

(NASDAQ:\nARLP) today reported that a final settlement has been concluded with its\ninsurance underwriters concerning the expenses and losses attributable to the\nmine fire that occurred earlier this year at the Partnership\'s Dotiki mine,\noperated by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Webster County Coal, LLC. (See ARLP\nPress Releases, dated February 12, March 1, March 8, March 25, April 23 and July\n22, 2004.)\n\nThe settlement covers all expenses, losses and claims incurred by Webster County\nCoal and other affiliates in an aggregate amount of $27.0 million. This\nsettlement amount provides for reimbursement of expenses and costs associated\nwith extinguishing the fire, damage to Dotiki mine property, interruption of\nbusiness operations (including profit recovery) and extra expenses incurred to\nminimize the impact to the Partnership\'s operations stemming from the Dotiki\nmine fire. The net settlement amount of approximately $21.1 million reflects a\n$1.0 million self-retention amount, a $2.5 million deductible, and 10%\nco-insurance of approximately $2.4 million. The Partnership has previously\nreceived $8.1 million as partial advance payments of this settlement amount and\nexpects to receive the final net payment of approximately $13.0 million in early\nOctober, 2004.\n\n"I am extremely pleased that we were able to reach an equitable and expedited\nresolution of the Dotiki mine fire insurance claim," said Joseph W. Craft III,\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer. "Through the dedicated efforts of\neveryone involved, from the initial firefighting efforts to resolution of the\ninsurance claim itself, this settlement allows us to put the fire incident\nbehind us and focus on Dotiki\'s continuing bright future."\n\nAs previously reported, the Partnership recorded an offset to operating\nexpenses, as a recovery under its commercial insurance policies, of\napproximately $2.9 million and $0.2 million in the first and second quarters of\n2004, respectively. With the completion of the final settlement in the third\nquarter of 2004, the Partnership will record an additional offset to operating\nexpenses of approximately $2.8 million and a gain of approximately $15.2 million\nattributable to property damage, interruption of business operations (including\nprofit recovery), and extra expenses incurred to minimize the period and total\ncost of disruption to the Partnership\'s operations as a result of the Dotiki\nmine fire.\n\nAs a result of the $18 million impact of the final insurance settlement, the\nlimited partners\' interest in net income for the third quarter of 2004 will\nincrease by approximately $17.6 million or $0.98 and $0.96 per basic and diluted\nlimited partner unit, respectively. In addition, the Partnership is\n\n\n\n                                     -MORE-\n', u'\n\nincreasing its estimate of net income for the year ending December 31, 2004 from\na range of $70.0 to $80.0 million to a range of $88.0 to $98.0 million.\n\nAlliance Resource Partners is the nation\'s only publicly traded master limited\npartnership involved in the production and marketing of coal. Alliance Resource\nPartners currently operates mining complexes in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and\nMaryland.\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS: WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HISTORICAL MATTERS, ANY\nMATTERS DISCUSSED IN THIS PRESS RELEASE ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT\nINVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER\nMATERIALLY FROM PROJECTED RESULTS.
