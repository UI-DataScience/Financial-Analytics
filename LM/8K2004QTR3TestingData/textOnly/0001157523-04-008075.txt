LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 23, 2004--Angelica Corporation\n(NYSE: AGL), a leading provider of healthcare linen management\nservices, today reported financial results for the second quarter and\nsix months ended July 31, 2004. Continuing operations results exclude\nthe Company\'s Life Uniform retail division, which was sold during the\nsecond quarter to Healthcare Uniform Company, Inc., an affiliate of\nSun Capital Partners, Inc., and is shown as discontinued operations.\n    Revenue from continuing operations for the second quarter of\nfiscal 2004 was $77.9 million, an increase of 9.7% from $71.0 million\nin the second quarter of fiscal 2003. The increase in revenue was due\nto contributions from recent laundry acquisitions, as well as organic\ngrowth from increased market penetration and new facilities. Net\nincome from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal\n2004 was $2.8 million or $.30 per diluted share, compared to $3.6\nmillion or $.40 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal\n2003. Fiscal 2003 included $1.9 million of non-operating income in\nconnection with the payment of a distribution upon liquidation of an\ninsurance carrier of the Company.\n    Income from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 was\n$3.7 million, up 8.1% from $3.5 million in fiscal 2003. Increased\nrevenue and a $1.3 million gain from the sale of non-healthcare\naccounts in Daytona Beach, Florida in the second quarter of fiscal\n2004 were offset to some extent by increased natural gas, linen and\nlabor costs, costs associated with closing the Daytona Beach facility,\nand start-up costs in our two new Carolina plants, including the\nhealthcare laundry facility at Duke University in North Carolina\nacquired in the second quarter.\n    The second quarter net loss from the discontinued Life Uniform\noperations was $1.3 million. The Company completed the sale of its\nLife Uniform retail division to Healthcare Uniform Company on July 31,\n2004. The assets sold included 196 retail uniform and shoe stores, as\nwell as Life Uniform\'s fully-integrated catalogue, e-commerce and\non-the-job shopping platform operations and associated inventory. A\ntotal of 17 stores not included in the sale have been closed.\n    For the six months ended July 31, 2004, revenue from continuing\noperations increased 9.3% to $155.6 million from $142.3 million for\nthe same period in 2003. As in the second quarter, the increase in\nrevenue was due to a combination of acquisitions and organic growth.\nNet income from continuing operations was $5.3 million or $.58 per\ndiluted share, as compared to $5.8 million or $.65 per diluted share\nduring the same period in 2003. Increased revenue was offset by higher\ngas, linen and labor costs, as well as start-up costs in our two new\nCarolina plants.\n    For the first six months ended July 31, 2004 net loss from the\ndiscontinued Life Uniform operations was $3.6 million. This included a\nloss from operations of $0.6 million and a loss on the sale of assets\nof $3.0 million.\n    "We are pleased with the results achieved during the first half of\n2004 especially given the difficult natural gas market," said Steve\nO\'Hara, President and CEO. "Our solid revenue growth is a reflection\nof increased focus on our healthcare linen management services and the\nmarket opportunity. With the completion of the sale of Life Uniform,\nwe can now focus all of our resources on capturing these\nopportunities. We continue to expect to deliver fiscal year earnings\nfrom continuing operations of $1.15 to $1.30 per share in 2004."\n    Mr. O\'Hara continued, "At the beginning of this year, we outlined\nour goals of streamlining our business to become a \'pure play\'\nhealthcare linen management provider, which we did by selling our Life\nUniform business, and to use our solid balance sheet and cash flow to\ninvest in energy-efficient equipment and increase our market share in\nhealthcare linen management through acquisitions and organic growth.\nSince last Fall, we have opened two new, more efficient facilities in\nSouth Carolina and Arizona, acquired healthcare linen plants in\nFlorida and North Carolina, and acquired selected assets of two small\nregional competitors and two hospital on-premise laundry (OPL)\nfacilities."\n    Mr. O\'Hara concluded, "We are excited about our long-term growth\nopportunities as healthcare providers increasingly seek a\ncost-effective, quality-controlled option for their linen services. In\naddition, we are aggressively pursuing accretive acquisitions to\nutilize better our debt capacity to grow our business.\n    Angelica Corporation will host a conference call on August 24,\n2004 to discuss its fiscal year 2004 second quarter results at 10:00\nAM CDT (11:00 AM Eastern).
