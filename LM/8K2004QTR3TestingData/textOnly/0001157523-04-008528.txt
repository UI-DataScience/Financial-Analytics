For the\nnine months ended August 31, 2004, net revenues increased 36 percent\nto $8,779,614 from $6,458,268.\n    U.S. net revenues climbed 44 percent in the third quarter to\n$2,600,458 from $1,808,485 in the same period of 2003. International\nnet revenues were $475,915 compared with $495,395 in the third quarter\nof 2003. For the nine-month period, U.S. net revenues increased 40\npercent to $7,390,347 and international net revenues increased 17\npercent to $1,389,267.\n    Somanetics reported record third quarter net income of $539,722,\nor $0.05 per diluted share, compared with net income of $75,454, or\n$0.01 per diluted share, in the same period of 2003. For the\nnine-month period, Somanetics reported net income of $1,242,197, or\n$0.11 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $249,368, or\n$0.03 per diluted share, in the same period of 2003.\n    Gross margins increased to 86 percent in the third quarter from 77\npercent in the same period of 2003 and 83 percent in the second\nquarter of 2004. For the nine-month period, gross margins were 83\npercent, compared with 76 percent in the first nine months of 2003.\n    At August 31, 2004, the Company\'s cash balance was $6.3 million.\nFor the nine-month period, net increase in cash was $4.1 million and\nnet cash provided by operations was $1.9 million.\n    "A strong U.S. performance led to record net revenues and net\nincome for the quarter," said Bruce Barrett, Somanetics\' president and\nCEO. "International results this quarter reflected purchasing\nseasonality by our distributors; the third quarter of 2003 featured\nunusually high demand by Tyco Healthcare."\n\n    Recent Highlights\n\n    During the quarter, Somanetics completed its initiative to double\nthe size of the U.S. direct sales team, and the sales team was\nsupplemented with the addition of independent representatives in some\nwestern markets.\n    During the third quarter, Somanetics achieved an important\nmilestone when the South Korean government approved reimbursement for\nuse of the INVOS System. The next step is to work with government\nofficials to determine which patients will be covered and the level of\nreimbursement.\n    Somanetics and Fresenius Medical Care Extracorporeal Alliance\n(Fresenius), a division of Fresenius Medical Care North America, plan\nto formalize their business relationship. Fresenius provides the INVOS\ntechnology to its cardiovascular perfusion customers. Fresenius\'\nclinical staff uses its expertise to demonstrate the benefits of the\nINVOS System and to educate the cardiac surgery team and hospital\nadministrators about the importance of monitoring cerebral oxygen\nlevels during open heart surgery.\n    "We are excited about this relationship because it is proving to\nbe an effective sales model in accounts where Fresenius provides\nperfusion services," Barrett said.\n\n    Outlook\n\n    "As a result of our third quarter achievements, we are raising our\nfiscal 2004 earnings per share guidance from $0.13 to $0.15 per\ndiluted common share to $0.15 to $0.17 per diluted common share,"\nBarrett said. "We expect fourth quarter revenue will be in the range\nof $3.5 to $4 million."\n    During the fourth quarter, Somanetics will attend a number of\nregional perfusion society meetings and the American Society of\nAnesthesiologists\' annual meeting, which is expected to feature more\nthan a dozen papers about the use of cerebral oximetry.\n    In October, a manuscript by Scott Goldman, MD, chairman of the\ndepartment of surgery at Pennsylvania-based Lankenau Hospital, a\nmember of the Main Line Health hospital system, will be published in\nthe Heart Surgery Forum. The article reviews the results of a study\nperformed by Dr. Goldman that showed a statistically significant\nreduction in permanent stroke among cardiac surgery patients monitored\nwith the INVOS Cerebral Oximeter.\n    Dr. Goldman\'s manuscript follows a recent publication of Seminars\nin Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia, which increased awareness\nof cerebral oximetry through articles focused on the topic of\nmonitoring the nervous system during cardiac and vascular surgery.\n    "Dr. Goldman\'s study is the first involving enough patients to\ngenerate statistically significant results, including reductions in\npermanent stroke, and the first to be published in manuscript form,"\nsaid Barrett. "We hope this data will help persuade cardiac teams to\nview cerebral oximetry as an important ingredient of an overall stroke\nmitigation strategy."\n\n    About Somanetics\n\n    Somanetics develops and markets two medical devices that offer\nsolutions to help meet critical medical needs. The INVOS(R) Cerebral\nOximeter holds a unique position in U.S. hospitals as the only\nnoninvasive and continuous monitor of changes in regional brain blood\noxygen saturation that is commercially available. The INVOS Cerebral\nOximeter guides the surgical team to identify regional brain blood\noxygen imbalances and help take corrective action to prevent\nneurological injuries related to surgery and reduce the cost of care.\nThe CorRestore(R) System is a cardiac implant for use in cardiac\nrepair and reconstruction, including an operation called Surgical\nVentricular Restoration, SVR, a treatment for patients with certain\ntypes of severe congestive heart failure.
