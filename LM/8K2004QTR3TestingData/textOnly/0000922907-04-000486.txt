Report of Operations and Financial Condition.', u'\n\n     As more fully discussed below in Item 4.02, on September 29, 2004, Energy\nWest, Incorporated (the "Company"), issued a press release announcing that the\npreviously issued financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2002\nand June 30, 2003, and the first three quarters of the fiscal year ended June\n30, 2004 should not be relied upon because of the misclassification of a handful\nof long-term contracts for purchase or sale of natural gas by its subsidiary,\nEnergy West Resources, Inc. and that those financial statements likely would be\nrestated to make the necessary accounting adjustments. The full text of the\npress release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by\nreference.\n\n', u'\nItem 4.02  Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related\n           Audit Report or Completed Interim Review', u'\n\n     On September 29, 2004, the Company issued a press release announcing that\nthe previously issued financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 30,\n2002 and June 30, 2003 and the first three quarters of the fiscal year ended\nJune 30, 2004 should not be relied upon because of errors in those financial\nstatements and that the Company likely would restate those financial statements\nto make the necessary accounting adjustments.\n\n     As reported in the Company\'s press release issued on September 29, 2004,\nthe Company is reviewing the accounting treatment of a handful of gas purchase\nand sale contracts previously entered into by its subsidiary, Energy West\nResources, Inc. Although the Company\'s review has not been completed, it\nanticipates that earnings for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 will be adjusted,\ncorresponding to adjustments in amounts reflected in its balance sheets as of\nJune 30, 2002 and 2003 for derivative assets and derivative liabilities. The\nexpected restatements will reflect the effect of the Company\'s determination\nthat several contracts entered into during fiscal year 2002 for the purchase or\nsale of natural gas at fixed future prices were erroneously classified as normal\npurchase and sale contracts. The Company now believes that these contracts did\nnot qualify as normal purchase and sale contracts under applicable accounting\nrules, and therefore must be reflected in the Company\'s financial statements at\nfair value, determined as of the end of each period. The valuation of such\ncontracts required to be reflected at fair value is referred to as\n"mark-to-market" valuation.\n\n     The addition of the contracts previously classified in error as normal\npurchase and sale contracts to the group of contracts required to be reflected\nat fair value is expected to result in adjustments to the mark-to-market gain\n(loss) in the Company\'s contract portfolio, for fiscal years 2002 and 2003, and\nthe first three quarters of fiscal year 2004. The restatements are expected to\nreduce net income for fiscal year 2002 in a range from $300,000 to $500,000. For\nfiscal year 2003, the restatement is expected to change net loss in a range from\na reduction in net loss of $50,000 to an increase in net loss of $200,000. In\naddition, the restatements are expected to reduce net income in ranges from\n$100,000 to $200,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, from $200,000 to\n$300,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2003, and from $50,000 to $100,000\nfor the quarter ended March 31, 2004.\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n\n     None of the adjustments the Company anticipates making will affect the\nCompany\'s cash flows or cash positions during those years, or the first three\nquarters of fiscal year 2004. The Company\'s cumulative gain (loss) in the\nportfolio of contracts valued on a mark-to-market basis will be reversed in\nlater periods as contracts settle or are performed and/or as natural gas prices\nchange. The expected effects of such reversal in later periods will be to\nincrease the Company\'s income in future periods through fiscal year 2009, so\nthat the cumulative decrease in net income expected to result from the\nrestatements of prior periods will be offset in those future periods.\n\n     The gas purchase and sale contracts that are expected to be reclassified\nwere entered into at the time of or shortly after the Company\'s termination of\nderivative contracts with Enron Canada Corporation ("ECC") during the third\nquarter of fiscal year 2002. The Company believes that its classification of\nsome of the gas purchase and sale contracts erroneously resulted in overstating\nthe income realized from application of mark-to-market accounting principles to\nthe contract portfolio. Accordingly, the Company expects that the results of the\nrestatements may reflect that the net effect of the termination of the ECC\nderivatives will include a material downward adjustment of net income in fiscal\nyear 2002. The Company is continuing to review the effects of these transactions\non its financial statements.\n\n     The estimated effects of the restatements are preliminary and subject to\naudit. The final amount of the adjustments will be based upon the completion of\nthe review by the Company and its independent auditors.\n\n     The Audit Committee of the Company\'s Board of Directors concluded on\nSeptember 29, 2004, based on the information available at that time, that the\npreviously issued financial statements for fiscal years 2002 and 2003, and the\nfirst three quarters of fiscal year 2004, should not be relied upon because of\nerrors in those financial statements and that the Company likely would restate\nthose financial statements to make the necessary accounting adjustments.\n\n     The Company\'s Audit Committee has discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP, the\nCompany\'s independent auditors, the matters disclosed in this Current Report on\nForm 8-K.\n\n     The full text of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and\nincorporated herein by reference.  In addition, this Current Report on Form 8-K\nand the press release contain statements intended as "forward-looking statements"\nwhich are subject to the cautionary statements about forward-looking statements\nset forth in the Company\'s press release.\n\n', u'\nItem 9.01.

The review was\ninitiated in connection with the finalization of the audit of the Company\'s\nfinancial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004. The Company also\nstated that it anticipates that it is likely that the review will result in a\nrestatement of certain components of the Company\'s financial statements for the\nfiscal years ended June 30, 2002 and June 30, 2003, and the first three quarters\nof the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.\n\n         None of the adjustments the Company anticipates making will affect the\nCompany\'s cash flows or cash positions during those years, or the first three\nquarters of fiscal year 2004. In addition, the Company anticipates that the\nexpected cumulative downward adjustments in net income for previous periods will\nbe offset by increases in net income in future periods through fiscal year 2009\nas the value of the Company\'s portfolio of contracts adjusts through settlement\nor performance and changes in natural gas prices.\n\n         The Company stated that, although its review has not been completed, it\nanticipates that earnings for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 will be adjusted,\ncorresponding to adjustments in amounts reflected in its balance sheets as of\nJune 30, 2002 and June 30, 2003 for derivative assets and derivative\nliabilities. The expected restatements will reflect the effect of the Company\'s\ndetermination that several contracts entered into during fiscal year 2002 for\nthe purchase or sale of natural gas at fixed future prices were erroneously\nclassified as normal purchase and sale contracts. The Company now believes that\nthese contracts did not qualify as normal purchase and sale contracts under\napplicable accounting rules, and therefore must be reflected in the Company\'s\nfinancial statements at fair value, determined as of the end of each period. The\nvaluation of such contracts required to be reflected at fair value is referred\nto as "mark-to-market" valuation.\n\n         The addition of the contracts previously classified in error as normal\npurchase and sale contracts to the group of contracts required to be reflected\nat fair value is expected to result in adjustments to the mark-to-market gain\n(loss) in the Company\'s contract portfolio, for fiscal years 2002 and 2003, and\nthe first three quarters of fiscal year 2004. The restatements are expected to\nreduce net income for fiscal year 2002 in a range from $300,000 to $500,000. For\nfiscal year 2003, the restatement is expected to change net loss in a range from\na reduction in net loss of $50,000 to an increase in net loss of $200,000. In\naddition, the restatements are expected to reduce net income in ranges from\n$100,000 to $200,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, from $200,000 to\n$300,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2003, and from $50,000 to $100,000\nfor the quarter ended March 31, 2004.\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n\n         The Company\'s cumulative gain (loss) in the portfolio of contracts\nvalued on a mark-to-market basis will be reversed in later periods as contracts\nsettle or are performed and/or as natural gas prices change. The expected\neffects of such reversal in later periods will be to increase the Company\'s\nincome in future periods through fiscal year 2009, so that the cumulative\ndecrease in net income expected to result from the restatements of prior periods\nwill be offset in those future periods.\n\n         The gas purchase and sale contracts that are expected to be\nreclassified were entered into at the time of or shortly after the Company\'s\ntermination of derivative contracts with Enron Canada Corporation ("ECC") during\nthe third quarter of fiscal year 2002. The Company believes that its\nclassification of some of the gas purchase and sale contracts erroneously\nresulted in overstating the income realized from application of mark-to-market\naccounting principles to the contract portfolio. Accordingly, the Company\nexpects that the results of the restatements may reflect that the net effect of\nthe termination of the ECC derivatives will include a material downward\nadjustment of net income in fiscal year 2002. The Company is continuing to\nreview the effects of these transactions on its financial statements.\n\n         The estimated effects of the restatements are preliminary and subject\nto audit. The final amount of the adjustments will be based upon the completion\nof the review by the Company and its independent auditors.\n\n         The Audit Committee of the Company\'s Board of Directors concluded\ntoday, based on the information available at this time, that the previously\nissued financial statements for fiscal years 2002 and 2003, and the first three\nquarters of fiscal year 2004, should not be relied upon because of errors in\nthose financial statements and that the Company likely would restate those\nfinancial statements to make the necessary accounting adjustments.\n\n         David Cerotzke, the Company\'s President and CEO, stated "although we\nare disappointed that our original treatment of these contracts was not fully in\naccordance with the accounting rules, we believe our actions now will completely\nresolve the earlier errors in classification of these contracts. This is a\nsignificant step in putting behind us the problems associated with our marketing\nactivities, and allowing us to focus on our core utility operations. I would\nlike to emphasize that, in evaluating the cumulative impact of these changes, it\nis very important to keep in mind that these adjustments have no effect on past\nor future cash flow, and that the downward effect of the adjustments on our net\nincome in previous periods will be reversed by corresponding increases in net\nincome in future periods."\n\n         The Company made a filing today with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission to extend the date for filing its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nJune 30, 2004 by up to 15 calendar days from September 28, 2004, the original\ndeadline. The Company expects to file its Form 10-K with the Securities and\nExchange Commission on or before October 13, 2004.\n\n- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSafe Harbor Forward Looking Statement: Energy West is including the following\ncautionary statement in the release to make applicable and to take advantage of\nthe safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of\n1995 for any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of Energy West.\nForward-looking statements are all statements other than\n\n', u'\n', u'\n', u'\n\nstatements of historical fact, including without limitation those that are\nidentified by the use of the words "anticipates," "estimates," "expects,"\n"intends," "plans," "predicts," and similar expressions.
