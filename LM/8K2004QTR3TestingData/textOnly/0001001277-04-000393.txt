"We recently signed a lease for a new manufacturing facility\nnear our current campus in China which will provide the necessary  space for the\nnew CSTN  manufacturing  line. We anticipate  the equipment will be in place for\ninitial runs by the middle of October,  thus  allowing us to produce  prototypes\nfor customer  qualification,  with mass  production  projected by the end of the\nfiscal  first  quarter.
