When used in\nthe filings the words "anticipate",  "believe",  "estimate", "expect", "future",\n"intend",  "plan" or the negative of these terms and similar expressions as they\nrelate  to  Registrant  or  Registrant\'s  management  identify  forward  looking\nstatements.  Such statements reflect the current view of Registrant with respect\nto future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties,  assumptions and other\nfactors relating to Registrant\'s industry,  Registrant\'s  operations and results\nof operations and any businesses that may be acquired by Registrant.  Should one\nor more of these risks or  uncertainties  materialize,  or should the underlying\nassumptions prove incorrect,  actual results may differ significantly from those\nanticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended or planned.\n\n     Although Registrant believes that the expectations reflected in the forward\nlooking  statements are reasonable,  Registrant cannot guarantee future results,\nlevels  of  activity,  performance  or  achievements.   Except  as  required  by\napplicable law,  including the securities laws of the United States,  Registrant\ndoes not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these\nstatements to actual results.\n\nITEM 2.01.  COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.\n\nThe  following  discussion  is provided  solely for the purpose of correcting an\nerror in  Registrant\'s  Amendment No. 1 to the Current  Report on Form 8-K filed\nwith the commission on August 20, 2004 (the "Prior Report").\n\nIn the  discussion  under Item 2 under the heading  "Intellectual  Properties"on\npage 6 of the Prior  Report and under the  heading  "Certain  Relationships  and\nRelated  Transactions,"  on page 17 of the Prior Report,  the Registrant  stated\nthat "SDTD and SDID has a royalty  free  license to use 2 Canadian  patents from\nImperial Canadian Overseas Capital Corporation ("ICOC").  Mr. Ian Cheng Yi Feng,\nPresident and C.E.O of SDID, is a shareholder  and director of ICOC. The license\nexpires in December, 2011." These statements are erroneous.\n\nThe Registrant  wishes to clarify both the content and the errors in translation\nfrom Chinese to English as follows:\n\nMr. Ian Cheng Yi Feng  first  explored  energy  savings  software  in 1999 for a\nCanadian company called Imperial Canadian Overseas Capital Corporation ("ICOC").\nICOC  then  sold and  transferred  the  initial  software  technology  it had to\nShenzhen Baobo Industrial (now SDTD) pursuant to a Technology Transfer Agreement\ndated December 2001 for  consideration  of RMB$2 million.  This is a transfer of\ntechnology,  not patent.  This agreement provided for a termination in December,\n2011.  This agreement was  subsequently  amended on January 3, 2003 to eliminate\nthe  termination  date and  changed  the  term to  permanently  effective.  This\nagreement  also  provides  that  SDTD has the  right  to  further  develop  this\ntechnology to create its own  intellectual  properties and SDTD has the right to\ntransfer,  trade,  use and make it SDTD\'s  patent.  ICOC  further  declares  and\nundertakes in this  agreement that it has never applied and will never apply for\nany patent covering the initial software technology in any countries.\n\nWith this  technology,  SDTD put together the  technicians  and  programmers and\ndeveloped  the chip set that is the heart of the  intelligence  control  circuit\n\n                                       2\n', u"\n\nboard Switching System used in Starway's products. Subsequently, Mr. Cheng Ming,\na shareholder and director of SDTD,  applied for a patent in China covering this\ntechnology in April, 2003 and was granted preliminary  approval of the patent by\nthe Chinese intellectual property agency on September 19, 2003. All rights under\nsuch  patent were then  transferred  to SDTD by Mr.  Cheng Ming on December  19,\n2003.\n\nITEM 2.02.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\n\nOn August 23, 2004, the  Registrant  announced its results for the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2004. A copy of the press release is attached as an exhibit.\n\nIn addition, the Registrant wishes to clarify errors in translation in the press\nrelease from Chinese to English.  The press release  erroneously stated that the\nresults were audited. The results,  however, were not in fact audited but merely\nreviewed by the Registrant's auditors. Further, the press release stated that on\nAugust 25, 2004,  the  Registrant  was to issue a convertible  note.  Such note,\nhowever,  has  already  been issued and what was to occur on August 25, 2004 was\nthe conversion of such note into common stock of the Registrant.\n\nITEM 3.02.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\n\nOn August 25, 2004, the Company issued 11,451,336 shares of common stock, in the\naggregate, to EuroFaith Holdings, Inc.'s assignees and 3 individuals pursuant to\na conversion of outstanding  convertible notes held by EuroFaith Holdings,  Inc.\nand the 3 individuals.  This  transaction was effected under Section 4(2) of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended and  appropriate  legends were affixed to the\nshare certificate and other instruments issued in such transaction.\n\n\nITEM 9.

(OTC\nBulletin  Board:  RIMI  -  NEWS)  announced  today  that  it has  completed  due\ndiligence,  audit and consolidation of accounts in respect of the acquisition of\n50% stake in Starway.  The following actions are scheduled to be taken by August\n25, 2004.\n\n    *  Change of name of Rim to China Energy Savings Technology, Inc\n    *  Change of trading symbol from RIMI to CEST\n    *  20 for 1 reverse stock split\n    *  Issuance of $120 million convertible promissory note eligible for\n       conversion of 11,153,669 shares post reverse split) of Rim for closing\n       the 50% Starway deal.\n\nStarway holds 100% interest in Shenzhen Dicken  Industrial  Development  Limited\n("SDID"). The core business of SDID is the development,  manufacture and sale of\nenergy  savings  products in China.  All the energy  savings  products have been\npatented  in  China.  Due  diligence  has  been  completed  by Rim on the  above\nacquisition.  SDID  products  and energy  saving  technology  are leading in the\nindustry.  Different  from other  products found in the market that are hardware\nfor  stabilizing  the voltage,  SDID  products  are  composed of smart  chipsets\ndeveloped by  technicians  and  programmers  from Canada and China over the last\nfour years. The chipsets are used to form the new component,  "Smart Module", an\nintelligence  circuit control board. Used with hardware,  the Smart Module helps\nstabilize the voltage. The savings is then 2 times other products in the market,\nranging  from 28% to 34% and even  reaches 60% in some cases.  As spurred by the\nrecord  high oil  prices  around  the  globe and the coal  price in China,  both\nresources are in excess  demand.  Together with the economic wheel of China kept\nturning  rapidly,  the energy crisis in China can hardly be resolved in the next\nfew years. The only solution that Chinese government has is energy savings. This\nexplains why SDID\'s products are widely used and highly recommended  amongst the\nChinese authorities. The products have obtained government awards of achievement\nand  relevant  certificates.  In order to further  enhance  its  energy  savings\nbusiness,  SDID  contemplate  investing and  developing a wind energy project in\nXinjiang  Province,  China  by  the  end  of  2004.  The  project  has  obtained\npreliminary  approval of Xinjiang  government and is enjoying  taxation and land\nuse privileges.\n\nIn view of the above,  the net profit of Starway of 2002 since  commencement  of\nbusiness  of SDID is $1.79  million and that of 2003 is $8.9  million.  From the\naudited  management  account,  the net  profit  for the  first 6 months  of 2004\nreached  $13.1  million.  The estimated net profit for the year 2004 will exceed\n$26  million.  The PE ratio  will be 14 basing on the total  outstanding  shares\nafter the stock split and the closing  price $0.75 of Rim as at August 20, 2004.\nThe net profit is on the rise for the coming years.\n\nAbout Rim Holdings. Inc.\n\nRim Holdings,  Inc. was  organized in Nevada on February 14, 2000.  Prior to the\ntransaction,  Rim was a  holding  company  holding  all of the  shares of Rimmer\n\n', u"\n\nComputers,  Inc. Rimmer is an approved  technical  service provider for computer\nhardware and  software  system  manufacturers  such as Novell,  Microsoft,  IBM,\nCompaq, Hewlett Packard, Cisco and others.  Following the transaction,  Rim will\nhold all of the  Starway  shares  acquired in the  transaction,  taking over the\nmanagement right of Starway.  Starway is engaged in the  manufacturing and sales\nof advanced technology  energy-saving products in the PRC. According to the test\nreports by various PRC  authorities  including  National Center of Supervision &\nInspection on Electric Light Source Quality  (Shanghai) issued in September 2002\nand Shenzhen Academy of Metrology & Quality  Inspection issued in December 2002,\nthe energy saving products of Shenzhen Dicken Group have the energy saving rates\nranging from  approximately 25% to 45%. The energy saving projects  conducted by\nStarway Group mostly  relate to public or street  lighting  systems,  government\nadministration units, shopping malls, supermarkets,  restaurants,  factories and\noil fields,  etc. There are small and  large-scaled  projects:  the small-scaled\nprojects  relate to  restaurants,  shops and small  arcades  through the sale of\nequipment,  and the  large-scaled  projects  relate  to  large  shopping  malls,\nsupermarkets, factories and public bodies through the provision and installation\nof equipment over a term usually extended for years.\n\nFor more information, please contact:\nMs Stella Sim (Tel.: 852 28913130),\nRim Holdings, Inc.\n\nStatements  contained  in this press  release that are not based upon current or\nhistorical fact are forward-looking in nature.
